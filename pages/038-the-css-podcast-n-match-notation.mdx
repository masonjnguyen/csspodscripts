| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.       |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=18.18)  | Today we're talking about a little micro syntax or pseudo class notation that you use when     |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=23.54)  | working with nth child, targeting and the nth child pseudo class.                              |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=29.06)  | nth child is used to target specific groups of items for styling, like every other list        |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=34.24)  | item or tiger stripe tables, and is super helpful in building consistent UIs with some         |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=40.24)  | sort of function that describes a global group of styling.                                     |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=44.48)  | Yeah, it's like position relevant styling.                                                     |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=49.0)   | Like what position child are you?                                                              |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=50.7)   | Were you the first born or the last born?                                                      |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=53.4)   | Are you an even number born child, et cetera.                                                  |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=56.76)  | And so it's like these fun ways to target based on position in the tree.                       |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=61.88)  | And nth child is being the most generic pseudo selector for use on child.                      |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=66.12)  | It matches all the elements of any type before matching based on position.                     |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=70.08)  | So it's kind of interesting, like each of these pseudo functions have an initial filter        |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=74.14)  | followed by the functional parameters that you pass in that we're talking about today,         |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=78.96)  | which is this mini match syntax.                                                               |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=81.18)  | So nth child and nth last child are like examples of functions that have mild pre-filters.     |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=86.68)  | But anyway, so it's like you have nth child, which I just described, and then nth last         |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=90.92)  | child where you start from the end of a series instead of the beginning.                       |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=93.6)   | So you can start at the last and then check position from the end.                             |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=97.16)  | So yeah, there's all these little twists on how you can find something based on position.      |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=101.4)  | There's also nth of type, which matches elements of a given type.                              |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=106.04) | So like a tag name.                                                                            |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=107.66) | So just to give you an example, you could do like p colon nth of type 2n, and that would       |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=112.48) | match every other paragraph element.                                                           |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=114.68) | So every other p element.                                                                      |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=116.42) | You could do like p nth of type 1, and that would only match the first paragraph.              |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=120.8)  | So you can select the type as well.                                                            |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=124.04) | And then there's also nth last of type, which is similar to the nth last child for nth child   |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=130.68) | where it would match starting at the end instead of the beginning of the series.               |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=136.2)  | And so it's kind of like a negative reverse from there.                                        |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=139.08) | But lots of stuff that you can do with it.                                                     |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=141.04) | Yeah, it gets really trippy, right?                                                            |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=142.62) | When you can sort of like flip it and reverse it.                                              |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=145.28) | Anyway, I'm sure Missy Elliott would love this syntax.                                         |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=148.36) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=149.36) | So instead of just saying like the third child, you could say the third paragraph.             |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=154.52) | So that's what nth of type is.                                                                 |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=156.24) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=157.24) | And you can target it specifically by its index, right?                                        |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=159.48) | You can say the third one.                                                                     |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=160.84) | And then we're getting into this mini match where you can sort of be like every third.         |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=165.04) | It's almost like you're setting up these calendar events for position.                         |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=167.56) | Oh, I like that analogy.                                                                       |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=169.64) | Calendars.                                                                                     |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=170.64) | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=171.64) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=172.64) | It's like it's a recurring weekly selector.                                                    |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=173.64) | It could be.                                                                                   |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=174.64) | Cool.                                                                                          |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=175.64) | So this we've talked about like nth child where most of the examples we're going to            |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=181.28) | talk about today are going to use nth child just so it's sort of easy and we've got this       |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=185.04) | baseline that we can work across.                                                              |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=186.68) | But what can you pass into the functional pseudo selector?                                     |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=190.08) | And there's some keywords that I think are the most common use cases, at least for me,         |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=194.72) | other than just like a direct index.                                                           |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=196.0)  | And that's even.                                                                               |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=197.0)  | So you could say nth child, open parentheses, even, and parentheses.                           |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=201.16) | And that matches all elements in position two, four, six, et cetera.                           |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=204.84) | So an even number.                                                                             |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=205.84) | And then you have odd.                                                                         |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=207.12) | Oh, here, pop quiz.                                                                            |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=209.04) | Is zero even or odd?                                                                           |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=211.64) | Zero is even, right?                                                                           |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=213.4)  | It is even.                                                                                    |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=214.4)  | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=215.4)  | Because one is odd.                                                                            |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=216.4)  | I had to look it up.                                                                           |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=217.4)  | Don't worry.                                                                                   |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=218.4)  | I was like, oh, I don't know.                                                                  |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=219.52) | And then there's odd.                                                                          |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=220.52) | So you can say nth child odd.                                                                  |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=221.58) | And that matches elements in position one, three, five, et cetera.                             |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=224.76) | And they work in any of the pseudo classes like nth of type and last of type.                  |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=228.08) | So you can say even or odd in those.                                                           |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=229.96) | And each of these handy keywords are shorthand for their mathematical representation.          |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=234.88) | Even is equal to two n, which is like saying every other item starting at number two.          |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=240.4)  | And then odd is equal to two n plus one, which is saying every other one, but with an offset   |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=246.08) | of one.                                                                                        |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=247.08) | So start at one and then count every two.                                                      |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=249.24) | So the further example here is like, you can say first child is the same as o n plus one.      |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=255.52) | Kind of interesting.                                                                           |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=256.52) | And then it sets us up for this mini notation episode, which is like two n, two n plus one,    |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=261.4)  | zero n.                                                                                        |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=262.4)  | What do these mean?                                                                            |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=263.6)  | And how does it really help me style things on the web?                                        |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=265.78) | So you want to kick us off with the mini match notation breakdown?                             |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=269.64) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=270.8)  | So the way to think of this is the formula of a n plus b, which is sort of like the functional |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=276.56) | notation of this.                                                                              |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=277.56) | So you just think of nth child and plus b.                                                     |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=279.76) | So you can read this as a n plus the bth element of like, say, a list.                         |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=285.92) | We'll think of it as a list.                                                                   |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=287.4)  | And a is going to be your integer step.                                                        |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=290.04) | So when Adam was describing the even numbers, that would be two n.                             |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=294.08) | That's every two items.                                                                        |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=296.5)  | Four n would be every fourth item.                                                             |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=299.04) | And it starts with that item.                                                                  |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=300.64) | So since we just went over that zero is even, and then it would pick zero, two, four, six,     |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=307.36) | that's two n.                                                                                  |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=308.36) | You're selecting all those even items.                                                         |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=310.28) | Now n signifies all positive integers starting from zero.                                      |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=313.86) | So if you have nth child of n, that would basically select every item that you have            |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=319.64) | there.                                                                                         |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=321.0)  | So it's not super useful, but when you combine that with an offset, that can be really useful. |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=325.84) | So b in this formula of a n plus b is the integer offset.                                      |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=330.12) | So you can select every item maybe after an offset, like nth child of n plus three would       |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=336.92) | select every single item starting from the third item.                                         |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=339.32) | So you would select the third, fourth, fifth, sixth list items, et cetera.                     |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=343.04) | And you can also do a negative n value too.                                                    |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=347.52) | So you could do like nth child negative n plus three.                                          |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=350.44) | This would select the first three items because we're starting at the offset of three and      |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=355.56) | we're going backwards through all the integers starting from that offset.                      |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=358.64) | So it's kind of like start at three and you go backwards.                                      |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=362.1)  | This would also kind of be similar to using like nth last child where you start from the       |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=365.68) | end and then you go to the beginning.                                                          |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=367.38) | So a few different ways that we can write these things.                                        |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=370.2)  | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=371.2)  | But you can also combine these.                                                                |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=372.74) | So if we combine a n with b, you could have something like two n plus five.                    |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=376.96) | And that means select every other item starting at the fifth item.                             |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=382.06) | So that would be five, seven, nine, et cetera.                                                 |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=386.76) | Three n plus one means start with every third item starting with the first item.               |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=391.6)  | So it would be like one and then four, right?                                                  |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=396.68) | And then seven.                                                                                |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=400.26) | And you could also just use the offset on its own so you could just do nth child four          |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=404.16) | and it selects the fourth item.                                                                |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=405.76) | And then it's just that one.                                                                   |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=407.88) | Very nice.                                                                                     |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=408.88) | You broke that down really good.                                                               |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=410.2)  | And I'm sort of like annoyed, but maybe not that nth child takes an index that's not array     |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=415.32) | notation.                                                                                      |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=416.6)  | Like first child seems like zero in most programming, but we target the first item in CSS.     |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=424.0)  | I wonder why that is.                                                                          |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=425.44) | It's not zero indexed.                                                                         |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=426.92) | Yeah, that's okay.                                                                             |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=428.52) | Okay, so that was the overall syntax, which allows us to sort of state in like a repeat        |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=434.4)  | function and then an offset.                                                                   |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=436.06) | And then we started either the beginning or the end.                                           |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=438.16) | Do you want to go through some more examples and just like play this out?                      |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=441.44) | Because I...                                                                                   |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=442.44) | Yeah, let's do like a little review of the episode.                                            |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=444.68) | I think that it just helps me so much with like these practical examples.                      |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=447.76) | Okay, so if I do nth dash child two n, that's going to step two elements on every other        |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=456.28) | item, but we start at zero because there's no offset.                                          |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=459.24) | So every two elements, and that's pretty much the even keyword then because we're starting     |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=463.4)  | at zero, no offsets every other item.                                                          |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=465.6)  | Okay, so nth child two n, not that big a deal.                                                 |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=469.36) | Okay, now play along at home.                                                                  |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=471.48) | If we have nth child of two n plus one, what does that mean?                                   |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=476.38) | Remember the syntax a n plus b, two n plus one.                                                |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=479.16) | So this means like two n start at the offset, which is one and do every other item.            |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=486.0)  | So start at one, every other item is one, three, five, seven.                                  |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=488.56) | That's the odd keyword.                                                                        |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=489.56) | Did you get that right?                                                                        |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=490.56) | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=491.56) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=492.56) | And starting with the offset.                                                                  |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=493.56) | This is for the audience.                                                                      |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=494.56) | Yeah, to the audience.                                                                         |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=495.56) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=496.56) | I think starting with the offset is kind of a good way to think about a lot of these.          |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=500.24) | It's like, yeah, your first thought is what's the type selector?                               |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=504.78) | Like am I just selecting all children or a filtered type?                                      |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=508.36) | And then what's my offset?                                                                     |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=510.16) | And then the two n kind of plays in.                                                           |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=512.08) | Interesting.                                                                                   |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=513.08) | Okay, so let's try another one.                                                                |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=514.28) | We have nth dash child two n minus one.                                                        |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=518.36) | So if I'm thinking about that same pattern, I'm going to say minus one, which means we're      |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=523.16) | going to start at the end of the list, but we're starting and then we're taking steps          |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=526.88) | of two.                                                                                        |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=528.32) | So that makes this one kind of a hybrid that isn't always even or odd because it's starting    |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=534.22) | at the end of the list.                                                                        |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=535.36) | So like if the list has four items in it and we go negative, we're going to be in an odd       |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=540.72) | scenario because we'll start at four and then we'll two n from there.                          |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=544.16) | I guess I would make it an even one, but if we start at five, it would be odd.                 |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=547.24) | So this one's kind of like dynamic.                                                            |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=549.08) | It looks at the list length minuses one and then goes every other one.                         |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=553.2)  | Okay.                                                                                          |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=554.2)  | And it does all that with four characters.                                                     |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=556.2)  | Okay, CSS, I like your mini match.                                                             |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=559.6)  | Okay.                                                                                          |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=560.6)  | What you got?                                                                                  |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=561.6)  | So let's do nth child of three n plus one.                                                     |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=565.32) | That would be starting at the offset, start at one and then three n.                           |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=568.92) | So that's every fourth item, right?                                                            |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=571.56) | So you have one and then five and then et cetera, et cetera.                                   |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=577.96) | You add nine and things like that.                                                             |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=581.52) | I also want to add that this is a recursive syntax.                                            |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=585.56) | So if you had something like nth child of three, that would select the third item.             |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=591.44) | So say like your element here is li because you have to apply this to an element li nth        |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=595.8)  | child three, it will be the third item in the list.                                            |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=598.48) | But if you have a recursive list, so if you have a list item and then another unordered        |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=602.4)  | list within that list item, that would then also get selected the third list item.             |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=609.24) | So it goes recursively throughout.                                                             |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=611.52) | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=612.52) | Right?                                                                                         |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=613.52) | Because the li was generic, it found all li's in their trees and then looked at positions      |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=617.76) | of each group.                                                                                 |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=619.32) | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=620.32) | Well, what about, let's see, we got nth child negative n plus six.                             |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=627.08) | So let's look at the offset.                                                                   |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=628.64) | We start at six and then we're going negative.                                                 |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=632.82) | So that's the first six in the list.                                                           |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=635.2)  | So we basically start at the offset and then go back to the beginning.                         |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=639.12) | Okay.                                                                                          |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=640.12) | Yep.                                                                                           |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=641.12) | So then if we have something like nth last child of a negative n plus two, so instead          |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=646.6)  | of nth child, we're doing nth last child.                                                      |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=649.38) | What does that look like?                                                                      |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=650.38) | So here, instead of the first six, we're targeting the last few.                               |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=655.38) | So if this is negative n plus two from nth last child, we'd be targeting the last two          |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=659.68) | of the list.                                                                                   |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=660.68) | So that'd be the last two list items within any of those lists that are within lists.          |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=667.5)  | So for all of that, you're always targeting the last two list items.                           |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=670.64) | So I was exploring this when I was working on my last role at a publishing company where       |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=676.2)  | we had a lot of fun challenges to solve for UI that I always wanted just UCSS only for.        |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=681.84) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=682.84) | So one of those was like doing credits for like at the end of an article.                      |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=688.96) | And I wrote like with CSS, if you had three or fewer credits, then it would be a block         |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=694.6)  | and it would kind of be like one above the next item, then the next item, the next item.       |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=700.36) | And then if you had four or more credits, we had like hair, makeup, photography, styling,      |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=704.8)  | like all of those credits, then it would kind of appear in line with the semicolon.            |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=709.56) | And I used nth child to identify how many items are in that list and then targeting            |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=715.4)  | all of the list items by using the adjacent sibling selector.                                  |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=719.9)  | So you can do like a few like fun tricks with this.                                            |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=722.8)  | We'll have some links in the show notes on things that you can do with this, but you           |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=726.0)  | can kind of do like conditional styling based on the number of items.                          |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=729.44) | If you're using like nth last child and then n plus the number of items and then the adjacent  |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=734.74) | sibling selector to look for those items and then style them.                                  |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=739.24) | You can like do all of this and get really advanced and do like sort of programmatic           |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=744.48) | styling based on the input number of items just by using the nth syntax.                       |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=749.24) | It's like, it just, it grows and grows.                                                        |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=751.14) | And so I think understanding it's a good baseline for that.                                    |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=754.16) | Absolutely.                                                                                    |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=755.16) | It's kind of like the first container query that ever got created.                             |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=759.36) | The one thing that like I struggle with about this is that you're targeting the child and      |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=763.94) | not the parent.                                                                                |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=764.94) | And sometimes I'd be like, okay, for example, what you described is if it's three items,       |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=770.16) | it's a block layout, four or more, they kind of get this inline layout.                        |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=773.76) | Did I summarize that well?                                                                     |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=775.24) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=776.24) | And so in my mind, I'm thinking, okay, if that's flexbox, the container has display            |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=779.86) | flex on it and the children are essentially flipping their basis.                              |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=784.76) | Like if they're three or less, they have a flex basis of 33% or I guess it'd be a hundred      |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=790.16) | percent so that they're stacked vertically.                                                    |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=792.16) | And then if there's four or more, you do a flex basis like, okay, but yeah, there's just       |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=796.6)  | But it's based on the items that exist in the container.                                       |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=800.5)  | So it's like pretty cool.                                                                      |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=802.12) | I do think it is like kind of like a pseudo container.                                         |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=804.6)  | It's super cool.                                                                               |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=805.6)  | You're querying the amount of children.                                                        |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=806.88) | I wish I could flip a grid layout.                                                             |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=809.64) | Like if grid could know how many children it had and then make a decision based on that.       |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=814.36) | But that would mean that the container is aware of its child count and that's not how          |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=820.06) | this works.                                                                                    |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=821.06) | It's the children being aware of their siblings, not the parent being aware of it's a number   |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=825.28) | of children.                                                                                   |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=826.28) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=827.28) | But that is, you know, very useful to have.                                                    |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=830.92) | Oh, it's super useful.                                                                         |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=832.24) | You still got to use JavaScript for that.                                                      |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=834.08) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=835.08) | There's some really, the container query stuff is so cool.                                     |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=836.9)  | This is the ability to be like, oh, the first four of you, I don't care about you.             |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=840.52) | Anybody after four, oh, you're dead to me.                                                     |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=842.6)  | You know, like you could style them.                                                           |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=844.24) | Or just being able to style all the children in the entire parent element based on how         |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=848.68) | many children they have.                                                                       |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=849.92) | Another example is like a carousel.                                                            |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=851.4)  | So say you have an example where you have like three cards and if there's three cards          |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=857.84) | that are horizontal, you want them to fit on the page.                                         |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=860.08) | They want them to contain within the layout.                                                   |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=862.4)  | If it's more than that, it's too many and you want to carousel and have that kind of           |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=866.4)  | like go onto like the negative space in the page.                                              |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=869.12) | I have to build this now.                                                                      |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=870.46) | That's so cool.                                                                                |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=871.46) | That like scroll snap points and a quantity query could make a really awesome robust slider.   |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=878.12) | Very cool.                                                                                     |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=879.12) | I'm, that's going to tickle my brain until I build it at some point.                           |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=882.56) | So thank you for that.                                                                         |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=883.56) | Very great example.                                                                            |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=884.56) | Yes.                                                                                           |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=885.56) | I have like a, like a demo of that in this article, but it's not a good one.                   |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=890.04) | It's like not accessible.                                                                      |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=891.6)  | I wouldn't recommend using it.                                                                 |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=892.6)  | It's just sort of like a proof of concept of this is a theoretical thing that you could        |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=896.52) | do.                                                                                            |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=897.52) | It's just like add this button that you could then display based on the number of children     |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=901.8)  | using nth match syntax.                                                                        |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=904.4)  | So tons of stuff.                                                                              |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QWnb3VbNTRPWiAEc3gUYA?&t=907.12) | I hope that you got a better understanding or just appreciation for this mini match pseudo     |
