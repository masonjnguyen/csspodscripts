| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.              |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=17.08)   | Today we're talking about spacing.                                                                    |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=19.84)   | This is a massive topic.                                                                              |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=21.56)   | We'll be breezing over some spacing history, like spacer squares, and getting into the                |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=26.92)   | modern spacing workflow.                                                                              |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=28.52)   | That's right, we're not going to talk about all of the different ways, but we're going                |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=31.28)   | to talk about many of the ways.                                                                       |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=32.6)    | And this can be with CSS, you got elements, pseudo elements, images, etc.                             |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=37.0)    | There's a lot of ways.                                                                                |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=38.0)    | Some of these ways are kind of dirty, and some of them are really clever, but they all                |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=41.4)    | just want to create a spatial relationship in our interfaces.                                         |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=44.76)   | Isn't that so cute?                                                                                   |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=45.76)   | So nice.                                                                                              |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=46.76)   | This is a great continuation of our last episode about logical properties, because spacing            |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=50.68)   | changes, they vary based on the visiting locale, and some of these techniques handle that for         |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=55.28)   | free.                                                                                                 |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=56.28)   | Yeah, that's free.                                                                                    |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=57.28)   | And kind of what I mean here is some spacing techniques are flow relative and others aren't.          |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=61.24)   | So there's a throwback to a term we learned in a recent episode.                                      |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=64.32)   | This is also a continuation of child versus parent owned spacing, which we talked about               |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=68.52)   | in our flex and grid episodes.                                                                        |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=70.32)   | So throughout this episode, though, be thinking about who owns the spacing and whether or             |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=74.26)   | not it is flow relative, as we believe these to be critical modern attributes of a spacing            |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=79.34)   | design system.                                                                                        |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=80.64)   | So you know, we got some classic or retro strategies here.                                            |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=84.04)   | Which one are you starting with?                                                                      |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=85.16)   | Let's start with the HTML technique.                                                                  |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=87.8)    | Now within HTML, we have things called HTML entities.                                                 |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=91.44)   | And these are reserved strings of HTML text that start with an ampersand and end with                 |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=95.68)   | a semicolon.                                                                                          |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=96.94)   | And they're used to denote reserved glyphs, or in our case, non-breaking spaces.                      |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=102.0)   | So you can use the HTML entity nbsp with an ampersand nbsp semicolon and use these with               |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=108.74)  | an elements like paragraphs or code blocks.                                                           |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=112.44)  | And this creates a non-breaking space.                                                                |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=114.94)  | Now you might also be familiar with the HTML entities of like and lt semicolon or and gt              |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=121.08)  | semicolon when writing visual code samples and creating these less than and greater than              |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=126.16)  | side instead of those coding carrots.                                                                 |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=128.44)  | And we do that, we use these entities to tell the HTML that we don't want to interpret those          |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=133.44)  | as code.                                                                                              |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=134.44)  | So you can use the nbsp, the nibsip as a little spacer there within your elements in your             |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=141.46)  | paragraphs in your HTML.                                                                              |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=143.68)  | You can also use a spacer gif.                                                                        |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=145.6)   | This is another retro technique.                                                                      |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=147.6)   | And this is a small transparent gif image that was used to create visual space on a                   |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=152.64)  | website.                                                                                              |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=153.64)  | Why a gif?                                                                                            |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=154.72)  | Because you can have alpha transparency in a gif and the file size output of that gif                 |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=159.34)  | was pretty tiny.                                                                                      |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=160.78)  | So people use that for spacing.                                                                       |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=162.62)  | Definitely wouldn't recommend using it today, but it's definitely a part of web history.              |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=166.28)  | And this is a technique that was first published in David Siegel's 1996 book called Creating          |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=171.36)  | Killer Websites.                                                                                      |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=172.36)  | Whoa, I loved that breakdown.                                                                         |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=175.28)  | Okay, I kind of want to go read this book.                                                            |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=177.44)  | It sounds like a gem.                                                                                 |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=178.44)  | I know me too.                                                                                        |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=179.44)  | And I like that you brought down the nibsip, the non-breaking space because that leads                |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=182.56)  | in well to the line break HTML element.                                                               |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=185.18)  | And as you were explaining the breaking space, it's like character spacing, right?                    |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=188.96)  | It's a space of a character.                                                                          |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=190.66)  | And then we have a line break, which is like content spacing.                                         |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=193.4)   | It's a break of a whole new set of content.                                                           |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=195.4)   | Anyway, for some reason, those just clicked for me a little bit right now that they're                |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=198.46)  | totally related in terms of like spacing.                                                             |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=200.8)   | Yeah, inline versus block.                                                                            |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=202.72)  | Inline versus block.                                                                                  |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=203.72)  | We got non-breaking space and a line break.                                                           |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=206.0)   | Yo, we're nerds, right?                                                                               |

| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=209.26)  | We love inline and block.                                                                             |

| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=214.8)   | Okay, so line breaks.                                                                                 |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=216.92)  | All right, that's the BR tag.                                                                         |

| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=219.28)  | The good old line break as a spacer.                                                                  |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=221.28)  | You've probably done this in a document and you didn't see that it would insert a BR for              |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=225.56)  | you.                                                                                                  |

| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=232.72)  | so that you didn't have to write some CSS.                                                            |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=234.24)  | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=235.24)  | Maybe it's just me.                                                                                   |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=236.24)  | We've also got pseudo elements and these can be used for smaller large spacing.                       |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=239.48)  | It's kind of like a spacer GIF, but you're using a pseudo element to do the same space.               |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=243.64)  | Some people call these ghost nodes.                                                                   |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=245.6)   | An interesting feature of a ghost node is you can make it expand or contract to take                  |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=249.16)  | up space.                                                                                             |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=250.16)  | So it's kind of nice.                                                                                 |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=251.16)  | They have like this invisible pushiness.                                                              |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=252.36)  | They're almost like black matter.                                                                     |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=254.8)   | Anyway, these create the illusion of space through like the name suggests and they can                |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=259.8)   | be really nice.                                                                                       |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=260.84)  | You also have an HR.                                                                                  |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=261.84)  | So this is another element that's in the HTML5 spec or just the HTML list of elements.                |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=267.4)   | And this is a spacing element by nature.                                                              |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=269.3)   | It's dedicated to space separation.                                                                   |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=271.3)   | In so much it's been blessed and it's a horizontal line or the horizontal rule.                       |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=275.96)  | And these can be great for full page breaks and not just line breaks.                                 |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=279.06)  | And also kind of small tip.                                                                           |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=280.12)  | Did you know that div is short for divider?                                                           |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=281.84)  | It's almost like div was a element that was made for space as well.                                   |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=285.44)  | So kind of fun little side fact.                                                                      |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=287.04)  | And now we just divide all our content into dividers.                                                 |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=290.64)  | Use semantic elements, my friends.                                                                    |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=293.56)  | So as we sort of touched on a pretty important content of the spacing is block versus inline.         |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=299.1)   | We do go over this a lot in episode nine, which is all about layouts.                                 |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=303.48)  | And in our last episode, which is episode 12 about logical properties.                                |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=307.14)  | But to sum it up in the webpage view, there are block and inline layouts.                             |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=312.76)  | Inline layouts flow the direction of the text on the page.                                            |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=315.76)  | So for example, if you have a Latin language like English, those read left to right.                  |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=321.04)  | The inline flow in this case would be left to right and horizontal on the page.                       |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=325.42)  | Inline elements would be within the same lines as the text flow.                                      |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=329.06)  | And a span element within a paragraph is an example of a naturally occurring inline element.          |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=334.24)  | You can also set any element to flow in the inline layout by setting display inline.                  |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=339.04)  | And this would invalidate any width or height specifications on the element.                          |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=342.52)  | But you can set margins and paddings and all those good things on these inline elements.              |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=347.12)  | Now with block layout, block layouts flow the direction of the content blocks on the                  |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=350.96)  | page.                                                                                                 |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=351.96)  | So for a Latin language like English, the blocks of the content flow from top to bottom.              |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=356.64)  | This is an important concept when we talk later about margin collapsing.                              |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=360.52)  | So think about these inline elements like headers and paragraphs and the way that when                |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=365.74)  | you have a header with a paragraph following it and another paragraph following it, those             |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=369.84)  | are going to then flow in the block direction.                                                        |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=371.66)  | They appear under one another, not next to one another like they would as if they were                |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=375.44)  | inline.                                                                                               |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=376.44)  | Again, as with inline, you can set a display block on any elements and this will enable               |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=381.12)  | that element to take up block space.                                                                  |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=383.36)  | This is frequently used for pseudo elements to take up the space of their parents.                    |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=387.26)  | And finally, we have to mention inline block here where elements get both inline and block            |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=391.68)  | qualities being able to flow in the inline axis, but getting a block property capable                 |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=397.76)  | styling like width and height.                                                                        |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=400.24)  | And we highly recommend checking out our episode on logical properties if you haven't yet to          |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=404.28)  | learn more about directionality and how it changes in regards to reading and writing                  |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=408.48)  | modes.                                                                                                |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=409.48)  | Yep, very nice.                                                                                       |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=410.48)  | Super important stuff.                                                                                |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=411.48)  | We're thinking about just blocks and inline blocks.                                                   |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=413.0)   | So that's like the space we're consuming and then we have space around us.                            |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=415.86)  | So there's all these different spatial concepts and thanks for breaking that one down.                |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=419.44)  | This next one is padding and this is, you know, you need some personal space and you                  |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=424.36)  | know, Yuna, I need some padding in my life.                                                           |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=427.0)   | I need six feet of padding in my life right now.                                                      |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=429.32)  | Six feet of padding at all times.                                                                     |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=432.76)  | And maybe even six feet of margin.                                                                    |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=434.8)   | You know, I'll just walk around with a stick and I'll just push everyone around.                      |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=438.68)  | Just kidding.                                                                                         |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=439.68)  | So padding is kind of like personal space though, although it's more akin to inner                    |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=443.24)  | space as opposed to outer space.                                                                      |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=445.52)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=446.52)  | Okay, anyway, stupid jokes.                                                                           |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=447.52)  | I think the six feet is more like margin.                                                             |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=450.4)   | All right, so like padding.                                                                           |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=452.76)  | Okay, if you're looking at a photo frame, it's the photo mat.                                         |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=455.72)  | And if you remember our episode, we couldn't remember that word anyway, photo mat.                    |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=458.72)  | Now it's ingrained in my brain and it's to go around the art.                                         |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=462.2)   | It's the space before the photo frame starts.                                                         |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=464.88)  | It's the space between the border and the art.                                                        |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=467.64)  | So it's like giving the art and its content some breathing space.                                     |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=471.26)  | So this is padding.                                                                                   |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=472.26)  | It is very personal and it is something that you put on the element.                                  |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=475.44)  | So the padding is child element owned and each element will need instructed which side                |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=480.22)  | of its box and by how much space that you want to give it.                                            |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=483.12)  | So and also kind of worth noting, depending on which border box property you have set,                |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=487.08)  | this padding can either add to the element size or not.                                               |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=489.84)  | Cool.                                                                                                 |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=490.84)  | So that's padding.                                                                                    |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=491.84)  | It's very personal.                                                                                   |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=492.84)  | It's very much around myself and it's individually owned.                                             |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=495.36)  | And then you have cell padding too, which is the same idea, but it's in table layouts.                |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=499.08)  | So padding, we have that to make space on the web.                                                    |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=502.18)  | And akin to padding, we have margin, which is not your personal space, but the space                  |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=506.0)   | that's external to you.                                                                               |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=507.56)  | So when we think of photos in a gallery, that would be the spacing between each of the photos         |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=512.6)   | that is still owned by that photograph itself.                                                        |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=515.24)  | So it's still owned by the child.                                                                     |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=516.96)  | Every child owns its own margin that you are applying the style of margin on top of.                  |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=522.36)  | But when it comes to margin, I want to talk about a funny little concept that you may                 |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=527.44)  | or may not have heard of, but you've almost definitely experienced, and that is margin-collapsing.    |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=533.26)  | It's a little weird, but it makes sense for a lot of default layouts.                                 |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=537.08)  | So in block layouts, in our example, we're talking about Latin language like English,                 |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=542.48)  | you have this block flow that goes from top to bottom.                                                |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=547.08)  | So we're going to think of these blocks as being stacked on top of one another.                       |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=551.92)  | So when we're talking about the margin here of block layouts, we're discussing the margin             |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=556.14)  | bottom and margin top of two layouts that are next to each other.                                     |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=560.52)  | When both of these elements have a positive margin value, those two margins are collapsed             |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=565.84)  | into a single margin.                                                                                 |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=567.78)  | So again, when both margins are positive, the larger margin becomes the vertical margin.              |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=572.74)  | It sort of eats the smaller margin.                                                                   |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=575.8)   | And this happens in three cases.                                                                      |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=578.76)  | Adjacent siblings are one case.                                                                       |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=579.76)  | So if you think about a paragraph following another paragraph or even a paragraph following           |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=583.54)  | a header, it's going to happen there.                                                                 |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=585.72)  | This happens when there are no content separators separating the parent and their direct descendants, |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=592.2)   | which enables that margin to collapse to the top of the parent.                                       |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=596.14)  | And finally, this also happens with empty blocks.                                                     |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=598.68)  | So when you have empty blocks, you're going to have the margin of that block collapsing.              |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=602.96)  | And for example, clearfix elements would clear margin collapse when you'd have both margins           |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=608.12)  | respected and visible.                                                                                |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=609.12)  | If you had a margin bottom and margin top and they're clearfix in the middle, that clearfix           |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=613.0)   | would remove this margin collapse from happening.                                                     |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=616.2)   | And then you would have the margin of the bottom and top adding instead of the smaller                |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=620.6)   | margin being eaten by the larger margin.                                                              |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=624.0)   | So that happens to positive margin values on the bottom and top.                                      |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=628.46)  | And that is all well and good.                                                                        |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=630.1)   | But then when you have negative margins, negative margins in general just decrease the space          |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=634.54)  | in between elements.                                                                                  |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=635.98)  | So in the context of this block margin collapsing, the margin collapse will be the sum of the         |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=640.96)  | values, not the greater of the values.                                                                |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=642.86)  | So if you have a negative number involved, it'll bring the elements closer together by                |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=646.5)   | subtracting from the positive value.                                                                  |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=648.98)  | And in the inline context, we're talking about negative margins.                                      |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=652.62)  | That's just going to bring things closer together.                                                    |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=654.48)  | So a concept that you just might not have thought about, but definitely exists is margin              |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=659.44)  | collapsing within margin spacing within CSS.                                                          |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=662.24)  | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=663.24)  | You got some hungry monsters in there, some margin monsters.                                          |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=666.88)  | A good way to think about this is, you know, like when you're in line to do a curbside                |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=671.5)   | pickup from your favorite restaurant and your margin is six feet, but the person in front             |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=675.78)  | of you might not be respecting the six foot margin and their margin might be four feet                |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=679.54)  | and they move closer to you.                                                                          |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=680.78)  | Guess what?                                                                                           |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=681.78)  | The six foot margin is what theoretically would be the space between you on the web                   |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=688.3)   | because it's the greater margin.                                                                      |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=690.62)  | So the web is more democratic in the sense of providing you your personal space.                      |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=695.54)  | Let's just say the web will not be getting as sick as other places.                                   |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=700.54)  | Is that example too personal?                                                                         |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=702.34)  | No, I like it.                                                                                        |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=703.58)  | It's kind of interesting.                                                                             |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=704.58)  | I mean, spacing and COVID do have a lot in common.                                                    |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=707.22)  | So I like the metaphors.                                                                              |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=708.9)   | They're nice.                                                                                         |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=709.9)   | All right.                                                                                            |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=710.9)   | Well, we got alignment next.                                                                          |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=712.3)   | So this is space can be created by alignment, right?                                                  |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=715.34)  | It's like if you have an element on the right of a box and an element on the left of the              |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=718.86)  | box, you created space in between them.                                                               |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=721.54)  | And with flex and grid, you can align all children with a single CSS property or you                  |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=725.78)  | can adjust the alignment of each child individually with its own special alignment.                   |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=730.42)  | Sometimes alignment results in tight spacing.                                                         |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=732.22)  | Other times it results in loose spacing and you can align to top, which is like block                 |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=735.42)  | start or bottom, which is like block end.                                                             |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=738.14)  | And CSS lets you align text and boxes specified using logical properties, kind of like we             |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=742.38)  | were just talking about there.                                                                        |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=743.74)  | And these would mean your line is flow relative, which is a plus, right?                              |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=747.42)  | We want to keep our things in flow as much as possible and in the relative flow direction             |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=751.82)  | that's coming from a locale.                                                                          |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=753.02)  | So your alignment properties can even follow those same things as long as you're using                |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=756.58)  | logical properties.                                                                                   |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=757.58)  | Like, for example, if you're using text align, you can specify end instead of right.                  |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=762.02)  | So that'd be text align colon end.                                                                    |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=764.2)   | And this means your space that you create would stay in relative flow and any visitors                |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=768.06)  | would have the same sort of alignment.                                                                |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=769.88)  | So yeah, create spacing by leveraging alignment.                                                      |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=772.02)  | It's good stuff.                                                                                      |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=773.02)  | That's so good too, because you get all the logical property benefits.                                |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=775.26)  | So I love that.                                                                                       |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=776.5)   | The next topic of conversation is distribution.                                                       |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=779.06)  | So like alignment, you could align items, but you can also justify content and justify                |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=783.74)  | items.                                                                                                |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=784.74)  | And that is thought of as distribution.                                                               |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=786.18)  | So distribution can be thought of as the justification of space within a grid or flex container.      |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=790.72)  | This justification specifies how items lay out either based on each other or based on                 |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=794.98)  | their parent on the inline axis.                                                                      |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=796.98)  | This is inline distribution.                                                                          |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=799.66)  | So again, for a Latin web page, you can imagine the inline flow being horizontal and you can          |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=804.26)  | imagine these concepts as being the spacing between the inline axis of cards within a                 |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=810.32)  | flex parent horizontally.                                                                             |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=812.46)  | So with justify content, you can use this with both grid and flex box layouts.                        |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=816.38)  | You can justify content to the start or the flex start.                                               |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=819.78)  | These are pretty much the same end or flex end.                                                       |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=822.66)  | You can justify content center.                                                                       |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=825.22)  | And this brings all of those child cards just squat into the center and they're going to              |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=829.82)  | be right next to each other within the center of the parent.                                          |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=832.54)  | But then there's also spacing between.                                                                |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=835.16)  | So justification with space between allows for distribution of the remaining space between            |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=840.98)  | each item to be evenly placed.                                                                        |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=843.58)  | And that means that the items on the end are flush to the parent block while every item               |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=847.78)  | within that distributes that space evenly between each item.                                          |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=851.66)  | There's also space around which distributes the remaining space around each item.                     |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=855.9)   | So items at the end would have space between them and the edge of the parent.                         |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=860.7)   | And this spacing between each item within that flex justification content area would                  |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=867.24)  | have doubled the spacing of the first item and last item to the edges of their parent.                |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=873.26)  | Since that spacing would be owned by the children, the space around, it will be doubled between       |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=876.7)   | the items and then the sides would be one of the spacing, which is kind of funky.                     |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=883.42)  | There's actually a newer property called space evenly.                                                |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=887.06)  | And this one was released with CSS Grid, but you can also use it with flex box now.                   |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=890.54)  | And it solves that weird issue with space around and gives you even spacing of children               |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=895.22)  | with the parents.                                                                                     |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=896.78)  | So the two end items would be inset from the edges, but the spacing of that inset would               |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=902.86)  | be equal to the spacing between all of the items.                                                     |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=906.22)  | So it would all be even.                                                                              |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=908.06)  | So it is more uniform that way than space around.                                                     |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=912.34)  | Also when I said space around, I was saying it as though the children own the spacing.                |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=915.42)  | That's not true.                                                                                      |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=916.42)  | The flex parent owns the spacing, but to illustrate the way that it is presented, it looks as         |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=920.9)   | though margin would look on the children.                                                             |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=923.5)   | So I think space between and space evenly are super advantageous to use within Grid                   |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=928.22)  | or Flex.                                                                                              |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=929.22)  | You could use space around for sure.                                                                  |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=931.06)  | I just feel like those two are a little bit more useful in my opinion.                                |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=935.02)  | But then in the Grid layout, you can also use justify self instead of justify content.                |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=938.78)  | So you can justify self on the child itself, not the parent, letting the child own its                |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=942.98)  | positioning.                                                                                          |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=943.98)  | And for justify self, you can apply the values of stretch, center, start, and end.                    |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=948.76)  | And those would all be respected by the logical flow of the page.                                     |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=951.86)  | Very nice.                                                                                            |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=952.86)  | I don't know about space evenly.                                                                      |
| [15:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=954.78)  | And now I do.                                                                                         |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=955.78)  | I love it.                                                                                            |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=956.78)  | Thank you.                                                                                            |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=957.78)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=958.78)  | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=959.78)  | We have another way of doing spacing.                                                                 |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=960.78)  | We have gap and I'm sure you know this, but this is our favorite way of spacing.                      |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=965.3)   | It's a parent owned spacing mechanism and it's flow relative and dynamic.                             |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=969.7)   | How much better does it get?                                                                          |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=971.54)  | You can add more children to a container and the spacing stays consistent between your items          |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=976.06)  | and you can visit from another locale, say Japanese, and all your spacing is even and                 |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=980.86)  | consistent for free as well there.                                                                    |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=982.78)  | The flex and grid both support gap flex is newer with this feature as it's only prototyping           |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=987.74)  | in chromium at the moment while Firefox has had it for a while and we're very excited                 |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=991.92)  | for this to be supported across all browsers.                                                         |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=993.82)  | It's a big win in our opinion.                                                                        |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=995.7)   | And why is it our favorite?                                                                           |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=997.14)  | Because you get so much for so little code.                                                           |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=999.34)  | I've got an international flex box gap video that we'll put in the show notes and it demonstrates     |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1003.34) | so good that one spacing declaration does the work that would take many, many page based              |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1007.9)  | media queries and margin to recreate.                                                                 |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1010.18) | And it didn't even show how it handles reversal and reordering all that for free with gap.            |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1015.42) | You just can't beat that with a bat.                                                                  |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1017.16) | Definitely check out that demo if you have time.                                                      |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1019.26) | It's a really great visualization of how useful gap is in layout.                                     |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1022.98) | Thanks.                                                                                               |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1023.98) | Yeah, and I want to make more of those.                                                               |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1024.98) | They're really fun.                                                                                   |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1026.14) | So gap also works with multi column layouts and really what we're saying here is that                 |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1030.7)  | gap the new alias like the short word works with multi column, but multi column has had               |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1035.28) | gap for a long time.                                                                                  |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1036.38) | Just it's like the long hand form of column gap and multi column layouts are great for                |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1039.98) | news and editorial layouts and you can put some spacing in between your columns of text               |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1044.58) | with column gap or now the shorthand gap.                                                             |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1047.18) | So it's funny how like a simple spacing concept like gap can feel so revolutionary, right?            |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1051.5)  | Anyway, I love it.                                                                                    |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1052.5)  | It's great.                                                                                           |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1053.5)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1054.5)  | So another like funny thing that you can do with spacing is using transparent borders                 |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1058.36) | for spacing if you wanted to.                                                                         |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1060.22) | I don't think we'd recommend this, but it's a totally valid part of the box model.                    |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1063.4)  | So yeah, check out episode one.                                                                       |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1064.96) | We talk about the box model more.                                                                     |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1066.3)  | It's a great episode.                                                                                 |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1067.94) | However, something that we would recommend you try out are math functions in CSS and                  |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1073.06) | I'm talking about min, max and clamp.                                                                 |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1075.58) | They are super cool.                                                                                  |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1077.3)  | All of these functions can be used anywhere that a length, frequency, angle, time, percentage,        |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1082.42) | number or integer is allowed, meaning that we can use them for spacing as well.                       |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1087.54) | And the browser support is pretty darn good.                                                          |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1090.94) | All of the new evergreen browsers, I wouldn't even say new browsers, just all evergreen               |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1095.1)  | browsers support all of these math functions and it is super cool and we should be leveraging         |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1100.18) | this more in our code.                                                                                |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1102.7)  | So the min function, I'll start with that.                                                            |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1105.62) | The min CSS function lets you set the smallest most negative value from a list of comma separated     |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1110.9)  | expressions.                                                                                          |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1112.1)  | So you could, for example, do a width of min and then in parentheses 50vw comma 400px close           |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1120.06) | parentheses and within that function is going to look for the smaller of the two values.              |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1125.46) | If 50vw, which is half of the viewport width, was less than 400px, it would set that as               |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1132.18) | the value.                                                                                            |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1133.18) | If you were looking at your page on a wide view on like a large desktop where 50vw was                |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1139.08) | greater than 400px, it would set the value to 400px.                                                  |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1142.38) | So you're kind of making this minimum clamp, if you will.                                             |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1146.42) | But I didn't say clamp.                                                                               |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1147.86) | That's a reserved word.                                                                               |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1148.86) | We'll get to clamp.                                                                                   |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1149.86) | So you also have the max function, which gets you the largest most positive value.                    |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1154.94) | So if you had a width of max 50vw comma 400px in a narrow view, when 50vw or half of the              |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1164.3)  | width of the screen was less than 400px, 400px would be set because it's the greatest value,          |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1171.16) | the greater value of the two.                                                                         |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1172.68) | But if you're looking at this wide view or 50vw is larger than 400px, it would set the                |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1176.76) | value to the wider view of 50vw.                                                                      |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1180.02) | And then the coolest of all of these, well, these are pretty cool, is clamp.                          |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1184.98) | And the clamp function enables you to set a value with a minimum and maximum bound.                   |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1191.24) | So you can set an actual value and then set a minimum and a maximum.                                  |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1196.36) | So the clamp function would be clamp.                                                                 |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1199.16) | First argument would be the minimum.                                                                  |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1200.8)  | The second argument would be the actual or the comparative value.                                     |
| [20:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1203.98) | And the third argument would be the maximum value.                                                    |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1206.66) | So for example, you could do clamp 1rem, 10vw, and then 2rem.                                         |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1212.32) | In this example, your value, like say this was for font size, your font size will always              |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1218.22) | be greater than or equal to 1rem, less than or equal to 2rem, and it will always take                 |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1223.96) | 10vw, which is 10% of the viewport width in size.                                                     |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1229.06) | So it'll be a value in between those.                                                                 |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1231.68) | It'll grow and shrink to those two min and max values.                                                |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1235.92) | So it's pretty cool to see how you can combine relative units with static units or absolute           |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1241.62) | units within CSS functions to create spacing or to create any other adjustments within                |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1248.66) | your layout.                                                                                          |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1249.66) | I thought this was super cool.                                                                        |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1250.66) | I want to dive into this more.                                                                        |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1252.2)  | And I was super pleasantly surprised about the browser support.                                       |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1255.6)  | Absolutely.                                                                                           |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1256.6)  | And that just means like spacing is really dynamic.                                                   |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1258.88) | I mean, spacing looks simple from the first glance.                                                   |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1262.34) | But once you get into things like clamping, where you have this constraint world where                |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1266.84) | the spacing is determined dynamically and strategically in the browser, that is just                  |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1272.08) | amazing stuff.                                                                                        |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1273.08) | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1274.08) | CSS, how cool.                                                                                        |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1275.08) | I just love you.                                                                                      |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1276.08) | It's getting so much better every day.                                                                |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1278.52) | We have our last type of spacing that we're talking about today is positioning.                       |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1283.16) | And so this is like absolute and static positioning.                                                  |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1285.62) | You know, you need some space to get away from other elements.                                        |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1287.64) | Well, just try offsetting your boxes' x, y coordinates, right?                                        |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1291.08) | So relative positioning will push away or be pulled towards other elements using physical             |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1296.08) | units, right?                                                                                         |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1297.08) | If you say top and left, these are physical directions.                                               |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1299.18) | You can create spacing this way by distancing elements from other elements.                           |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1302.66) | And relative can be handy when you don't or can't use padding and margin to do the work.              |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1306.5)  | And you want the element's box to continue holding its space.                                         |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1309.84) | So that's kind of critical about position relative is it will continue to hold its box                |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1313.78) | space and be offset.                                                                                  |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1316.2)  | Whereas absolute positioning will push or be pulled towards the other elements, just                  |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1320.52) | like we were before.                                                                                  |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1321.96) | But by going absolute, we cause the element to stop holding its space and become self-sized           |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1326.42) | and constrained to the nearest stacking context.                                                      |
| [22:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1329.3)  | So in terms of space, absolute positioning removes its contribution to the space and                  |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1334.68) | then needs exclusively directed through its physical units, its x, y, whereas relative                |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1339.44) | will continue holding its space in flow, but also be positionable through x and y.                    |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1344.48) | Super neat.                                                                                           |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1345.48) | And this last one here, hopefully you've heard of this already, which is inset.                       |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1349.48) | And this is similar to relative and absolute positioning with x and y coordinates.                    |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1352.98) | You specify x and y coordinates in an inset, but instead of physical units, which is the              |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1357.8)  | x and y of the screen, or like if you were in position absolute, this is top left, right              |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1361.98) | bottom.                                                                                               |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1362.98) | Those are physical units.                                                                             |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1364.08) | We can use the inset, which is the logical property units.                                            |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1367.32) | So this would be the equivalent of top left, bottom right, but we're being flow relative.             |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1371.94) | We're going to respect the user's locale.                                                             |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HqJd2WNsWwF5N4kdWmYUD?&t=1374.26) | So like some of the other more niche logical properties, this one's still waiting for better          |
