| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.               |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=17.84)   | On today's show, we're touching the subject of touch interaction.                                      |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=21.88)   | Touch interaction is one type of pointer event and how you would typically interact with               |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=26.12)   | a website on your mobile device or tablet.                                                             |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=28.82)   | I just saw yesterday that according to the gov.uk site data, their mobile user sessions                |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=34.08)   | are more than double the desktop sessions now at this point.                                           |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=38.56)   | They had 60% on mobile devices, 3% on tablet devices, and it was 29% on desktop.                       |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=47.04)   | And that got me thinking like, wow, that is a lot more than I had realized.                            |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=52.2)    | Because I remember about five years ago, mobile had just eclipsed desktop, like just, and              |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=59.16)   | it was a really big deal.                                                                              |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=60.16)   | But why is nobody talking about now how mobile devices are more than 2x the site traffic               |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=65.48)   | of desktop devices?                                                                                    |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=67.76)   | That's also, you know, when I told some people about the statistic, they were like, oh yeah,           |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=71.16)   | checks out with our site and our analytics.                                                            |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=72.96)   | Like that is pretty common now.                                                                        |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=76.2)    | So increasingly, web apps are becoming important, also just pure content sites benefit from            |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=83.16)   | touch interaction.                                                                                     |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=84.16)   | That's where a lot of your users are coming from.                                                      |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=86.48)   | And even if they are on desktop, a lot of laptops now have touch interaction these days.               |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=91.8)    | And it's just becoming more and more frequent to use the mobile web for everything.                    |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=97.16)   | So we wanted to go over some tips and tricks for designing and styling with touch interaction          |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=101.2)   | in mind.                                                                                               |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=102.2)   | Good call.                                                                                             |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=103.2)   | I use my laptop a lot with my Chromebook open, like open in a really tall mode and I rest              |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=108.08)  | it on my lap and then I just touch my way through shopping.                                            |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=110.64)  | And I really like that, like really close to my face, comfortable lap shopping experience              |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=115.78)  | with my finger.                                                                                        |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=116.78)  | It's very nice swiping through carousels.                                                              |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=119.2)   | It's just so satisfying.                                                                               |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=121.6)   | In this episode, I must not talk about potatoes though, like in episode 37.                            |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=127.0)   | Okay, so yeah, we're talking about touch today and that includes things like a stylus or               |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=131.8)   | a finger and allows users to swipe and zoom on their device to interact with whatever                  |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=136.16)  | it is you're trying to display them.                                                                   |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=138.22)  | Touch is super important.                                                                              |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=139.96)  | Starting at a macro view with page scroll, that's the first thing folks are going to                   |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=143.36)  | do is try to scroll your page and then maybe some testimonials or a product carousel.                  |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=147.68)  | They're going to want to touch interact with that.                                                     |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=149.48)  | We can get deep as we talk about minutiae like tap and holding on links, preventing                    |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=153.98)  | things like double taps, preventing zooming, enabling faster taps and writing media queries            |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=160.36)  | to adapt our interfaces to the different potatoes visiting our site.                                   |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=165.56)  | So before we get into the touch interaction styles, I want to mention a quick note about               |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=169.9)   | meta tags and how screens are rendered a little bit differently from mobile devices.                   |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=175.36)  | On mobile devices, there's a bit of trickery done by the browser and the viewport.                     |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=178.96)  | It's actually virtualized viewport.                                                                    |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=181.4)   | And by default, it would take a view of the page at a wider viewport like 980 pixels or                |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=186.4)   | 640 pixels and shrink it down to fit on the screen.                                                    |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=190.48)  | I imagine this is because of, you know, when the mobile web was new and most websites didn't           |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=196.08)  | have mobile sites, this would have a better user experience is to kind of have a shrunk                |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=201.12)  | down view than to have like a, just a portion of the viewport visible since it's not mobile            |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=207.84)  | optimized.                                                                                             |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=209.28)  | But because of this default, it actually makes it so that your media queries for smaller               |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=213.28)  | sizes never kick in.                                                                                   |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=215.28)  | And this works a little bit differently across browsers and devices.                                   |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=218.32)  | So for mobile optimized pages, there's a viewport meta tag that you have to add to tell the            |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=223.64)  | browser to view your content at the actual viewport width, not a virtualized and shrunk                |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=229.08)  | down one.                                                                                              |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=230.08)  | And that meta tag is, well, the name is viewport.                                                      |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=233.12)  | So it's meta name equals viewport.                                                                     |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=235.08)  | And then you can write something like content equals width equals device width.                        |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=238.5)   | And then also on top of that, you can do initial scale equals one.                                     |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=242.84)  | So usually these are all written together, the width equals device width and initial                   |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=246.16)  | scale equals one.                                                                                      |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=247.46)  | The width equals device width also alerts the browser that you're on a mobile device                   |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=251.4)   | and it does some other optimizations like reducing log time for touch interactions.                    |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=255.4)   | And so with these meta tags, we can prepare the browser for mobile sites and let it know               |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=260.12)  | it's about to serve a mobile site.                                                                     |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=261.4)   | And yes, I do want the width of this page to be whatever it is, like 400 pixels instead                |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=267.48)  | of providing a view in which you have to zoom to really interact.                                      |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=272.08)  | Totally.                                                                                               |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=273.08)  | It might be worth just briefly talking about at viewport, the deprecated tag and it was                |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=277.6)   | deprecated because well, right, hey, this is the CSS podcast.                                          |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=282.12)  | What we do and talked about meta tags and it's timing.                                                 |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=286.2)   | So let's say you had it in your style sheet with the at viewport.                                      |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=288.56)  | Well, it could have showed up way late.                                                                |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=290.84)  | And by then the browser's already laid something out and then it goes, oh, I hear you want             |

| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=296.12)  | Well, great.                                                                                           |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=297.12)  | Let me go rescale everything.                                                                          |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=298.12)  | And so, yeah, these...                                                                                 |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=299.12)  | Oh gosh, that'd be the worst layout shift.                                                             |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=300.72)  | Wouldn't it be the worst?                                                                              |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=301.72)  | And so now we have these meta tags and these meta tags, we do things for like color scheme             |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=305.68)  | also, and they just show up early, right?                                                              |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=307.48)  | They're like just as the documents being parsed and before it's even displayed anything, you're        |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=311.64)  | describing style, right?                                                                               |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=313.6)   | Anyway, so yeah, that's why we're mentioning that.                                                     |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=316.44)  | And yeah, I just want to mention the at viewport tag is deprecated because it couldn't time            |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=321.16)  | it well.                                                                                               |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=322.16)  | You couldn't be there early and often enough.                                                          |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=323.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=324.92)  | Nice coverage on the meta tags.                                                                        |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=326.64)  | I always have that one in my style sheets.                                                             |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=328.56)  | Okay, so let's talk about some CSS specific styles that will change touch.                             |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=334.88)  | They'll either enable it or disable it.                                                                |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=336.88)  | And we'll start with touch action, which is mostly about disabling.                                    |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=341.4)   | So by default, things like panning, scrolling, double tap, pinch gestures, they're all browser         |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=346.72)  | owned.                                                                                                 |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=347.72)  | But by clearly indicating which interactions the browser should handle, so which should                |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=353.48)  | you be doing, an app can implement their own handlers for the remaining gestures.                      |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=359.0)   | So it's a little tricky, but you can tell the browser what not to do by explicitly limiting            |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=364.24)  | what it should do.                                                                                     |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=366.96)  | I tried to make that so succinct and I don't know if I actually...                                     |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=369.72)  | Okay, so let's say if you specify none to the browser, then it's all on you.                           |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=373.72)  | You're saying, hey, browser, don't do anything.                                                        |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=376.04)  | I'm going to do it all.                                                                                |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=377.36)  | Right?                                                                                                 |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=378.36)  | Okay, so versus like you said...                                                                       |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=379.8)   | That's a dangerous one.                                                                                |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=380.96)  | That's a dangerous one.                                                                                |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=381.96)  | We'll talk about some of the warnings there.                                                           |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=383.84)  | But it's usually applied to a parent element or containers, and there's no need to specify             |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=387.52)  | it on children.                                                                                        |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=389.04)  | Its most popular use case is for games or maps where they set it to none and do all                    |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=392.92)  | the dragging, zooming and other gestures themselves.                                                   |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=395.2)   | So yeah, when they set it to none in a map or a game, they are taking on a lot of work                 |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=399.2)   | for themselves.                                                                                        |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=400.2)   | Now, one value that you can put in there is called manipulation.                                       |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=403.04)  | So you say touch action colon manipulation, and this signals that this element doesn't                 |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=407.56)  | want nonstandard gestures like double tap to zoom.                                                     |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=411.04)  | It also has this awesome ad benefit of single taps will dispatch immediately because it                |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=416.12)  | doesn't need to wait for a second potential double tap to fire the double tap event.                   |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=421.12)  | So it's like a one liner of CSS that can really speed up the feeling of your application.              |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=426.44)  | It's also worth noting, like Eunice said earlier, that if you have the proper meta tags, the           |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=429.8)   | browser will do this for you.                                                                          |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=432.88)  | They'll sort of say, okay, well, we'll give you the fast clicks, the fast taps, because                |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=436.48)  | you've indicated this is a mobile ready website.                                                       |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=439.64)  | Also the double tap to zoom feature, which was kind of like a desktop to mobile interim                |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=443.4)   | action, right?                                                                                         |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=444.4)   | You're like, you would double tap to zoom in on something and then double tap again                    |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=447.16)  | to zoom out.                                                                                           |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=448.8)   | You don't need that if you're with the view device with this at the anyway, whatever.                  |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=451.92)  | So that's the logic there.                                                                             |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=453.76)  | And the touch action manipulation is an alias for telling the browser that you want it to              |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=458.92)  | pan X, pan Y and pinch zoom.                                                                           |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=461.64)  | So you're telling the browser only do panning on, you know, vertical and horizontal and                |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=467.32)  | zooming, and that's essentially excluding double taps.                                                 |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=470.68)  | So that's again, right?                                                                                |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=472.28)  | You're telling the browser what to do in the hopes that it won't do certain other things.              |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=477.12)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=478.12)  | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=479.12)  | You want to tell us about another pan property?                                                        |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=480.12)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=481.12)  | So as you mentioned, this is an alias for multiple properties.                                         |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=483.6)   | You can write these in space separated list when you are setting the touch action values               |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=488.8)   | that you want.                                                                                         |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=489.8)   | So you could set pan X or pan Y individually or both, and this would tell the browser to               |

| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=500.48)  | If you're not familiar with what panning is, panning is the action of dragging a map.                  |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=504.28)  | So in this case, it would be a directional drag.                                                       |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=507.2)   | If it's an X direction, it's likely going to be a scroll or a Y direction could be a                   |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=511.16)  | scroll as well in the screen.                                                                          |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=514.62)  | So panning is kind of just like moving around on the screen.                                           |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=517.76)  | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=518.8)   | There's also pan left, pan right, pan up and pan down.                                                 |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=521.48)  | They're not supported in Firefox and Safari, but these are physical pan directions for                 |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=525.72)  | each direction in the scroller.                                                                        |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=527.6)   | So for each side of the box.                                                                           |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=529.14)  | And really what that means is it's sort of like giving you more granular power to describe             |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=533.92)  | to the browser which directional pan should it be handling.                                            |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=536.92)  | Because maybe you don't...                                                                             |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=537.92)  | Well, anyway, that's what it's there for.                                                              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=539.84)  | You're saying, hey, do this one pan, but don't do the others because maybe you want to handle          |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=543.8)   | something like a swipe right, but you want the browser to do its default thing when it                 |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=547.48)  | swipes left.                                                                                           |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=548.64)  | So that's sort of why you might want to use a single directional limiter with touch action.            |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=553.8)   | You can also do a pinch zoom as a value for touch action.                                              |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=557.32)  | And this tells the browser to enable pinch zoom.                                                       |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=559.74)  | You should always allow for some kind of zooming for accessibility reasons.                            |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=563.92)  | And pinch zoom is a really common web pattern to increase the size of content.                         |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=568.84)  | And it's not even really about just accessibility.                                                     |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=571.3)   | It's just a pattern that people, no matter what their needs are, use.                                  |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=575.12)  | I do this all the time.                                                                                |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=577.04)  | But it is a requirement to maintain good usability to have pinch zoom.                                 |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=580.68)  | That's why earlier I was like, oh, if you're doing touch action done, that's really dangerous          |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=584.16)  | because then you have to make sure you're building all the accessibility and all the                   |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=586.9)   | other things in yourself and not using the goodness that the browser provides.                         |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=592.04)  | Yep.                                                                                                   |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=593.04)  | And that zoom feature is always buttery and 60 frames per second and your content looks                |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=597.48)  | sharp.                                                                                                 |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=598.48)  | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=599.48)  | Yeah, it's a great feature to keep in.                                                                 |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=600.48)  | There's no reason you should be disabling it.                                                          |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=601.48)  | I wonder if the advice is instead of touch action done, just always do touch action,                   |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=605.58)  | pinch zoom.                                                                                            |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=606.58)  | If you're like browser, do pinch zoom, but don't do the rest.                                          |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=609.04)  | Well, I can see how in maps they might want to do other manipulation when you're doing                 |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=613.32)  | that pinch zoom action.                                                                                |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=615.0)   | So I can understand why in very limited cases you'd want to control that yourself.                     |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=620.08)  | But I feel like there's probably a whole team that's ensuring accessibility and all those              |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=623.6)   | other things in those unique situations.                                                               |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=626.08)  | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=627.08)  | All right.                                                                                             |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=628.08)  | Touch action also accepts auto and none.                                                               |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=630.0)   | So we talked about none a little bit, but auto is the default and it enables all browser               |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=633.92)  | handling.                                                                                              |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=634.92)  | It can be used also when a child of a touch action none container or just a touch action               |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=639.2)   | that's been limited container does indeed want touch events again.                                     |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=642.48)  | So you can sort of re-enable a child with this property by putting it on children.                     |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=647.52)  | And then none disables all of the browser handling.                                                    |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=650.6)   | And yeah, like we said, warning, this can lead to an unzoomable page preventing people                 |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=654.0)   | with low vision from having control over the legibility of their page content.                         |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=657.6)   | And that's not good.                                                                                   |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=658.6)   | All right.                                                                                             |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=659.6)   | So that was it for touch action.                                                                       |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=661.16)  | So those are a lot of ways that you can sort of disable browser default gestures.                      |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=666.8)   | And these are all only really things that you see on a touch device.                                   |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=670.2)   | That's a touch action you don't really see on a desktop environment unless you're on                   |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=674.4)   | a Chrome OS or something.                                                                              |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=675.4)   | But let's talk next about WebKit touch call outs.                                                      |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=678.78)  | That's dash WebKit dash touch dash call out.                                                           |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=681.6)   | And I tend to set this to none.                                                                        |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=683.8)   | So let's say you tap and hold on a link in a web page.                                                 |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=687.08)  | You get a system pop up interface or on iOS you get this portal card.                                  |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=691.76)  | And for that contextual link that you're sort of deep clicking into.                                   |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=696.32)  | And this lets you say no, that you don't want that.                                                    |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=698.96)  | Like this particular link on your web page, WebKit touch call out, none.                               |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=703.6)   | And that's a Safari only feature.                                                                      |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=705.0)   | So if you want to explicitly, it's like maybe you're making a native app or you're making              |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=708.76)  | a native hybrid app and you want to sort of disable the things that make it obvious you're             |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=714.52)  | still on the web.                                                                                      |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=715.76)  | So a lot of that's like a use case I'll see for these.                                                 |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=718.28)  | Anyway, so yeah, WebKit touch call out is Safari only, but the next few have more support.             |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=723.54)  | So also something to note is that these WebKit preferences, prefixed CSS features are non-standard     |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=730.2)   | and they're not on standards track for whatever reason.                                                |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=733.68)  | They would mostly only work in WebKit based browsers.                                                  |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=737.34)  | So just be aware of that.                                                                              |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=738.48)  | Make sure that you are doing your testing for browser testing.                                         |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=744.16)  | So most of them are a little bit older, newer CSS properties don't get prefixed like this.             |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=748.52)  | So just be aware, they do allow for a little bit of improved user experiences for certain              |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=753.92)  | browsers, but of course we want to have interoperability.                                              |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=757.12)  | So just be aware of that.                                                                              |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=759.74)  | But I'm going to talk about another WebKit property and that is WebKit tap highlight                   |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=763.84)  | color.                                                                                                 |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=764.84)  | So it's a prefix of WebKit for tap highlight color.                                                    |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=767.48)  | And this is that very quick interaction on your mobile device when you tap on something.               |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=774.14)  | Sometimes you get an overlay on that element.                                                          |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=775.72)  | So you know what you just clicked on and it's usually like a light blue or a light gray.               |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=780.48)  | Well WebKit tap highlight color lets you specifically style this if you set a color or you could       |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=786.12)  | opt out of it by setting that value to transparent.                                                    |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=789.8)   | So you could do WebKit tap highlight color, call it transparent and then you won't see                 |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=793.2)   | that quick little overlay when you're tapping something.                                               |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=797.2)   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=798.2)   | And I've used that in my hybrid apps.                                                                  |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=800.28)  | And we're trying to disguise how much web interfaces I've put into your native little                  |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=806.16)  | web view.                                                                                              |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=807.16)  | Anyway, yeah.                                                                                          |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=808.16)  | Because right, those are like the little hints that someone's like, oh, am I in the browser?           |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=811.52)  | I just got a highlight color on the link I tapped.                                                     |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=813.76)  | Oh, okay.                                                                                              |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=814.76)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=815.76)  | But I do feel like there is an accessibility benefit to having that highlight color.                   |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=818.24)  | So I feel like having, you know, an action response is nice and we should see more of                  |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=826.2)   | those.                                                                                                 |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=827.2)   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=828.2)   | So there are a lot of different styles for user interaction.                                           |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=830.48)  | You have to like active or hover and focus and all these sort of like the user is interacting          |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=834.96)  | with the thing.                                                                                        |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=835.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=836.96)  | UX feedback is top notch.                                                                              |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=837.96)  | So yeah, leave the highlight color in there if you don't have a replacement.                           |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=841.4)   | Totally good advice.                                                                                   |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=842.64)  | This last one we have here for the sounds called user select none.                                     |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=846.2)   | And this is essentially can the user highlight text and get the system UI for copy, search             |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=851.52)  | and share, et cetera.                                                                                  |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=853.64)  | So right, you tap and hold on a word in like a paragraph and then it will highlight the                |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=857.32)  | word and then brings up some system UI for, hey, what kind of actions do you want to take              |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=860.68)  | on that word?                                                                                          |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=861.68)  | And with user select none, you can specify that you don't want users to be able to do                  |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=865.6)   | that on that text.                                                                                     |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=866.82)  | And it's got great browser support.                                                                    |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=867.96)  | I think that one started out WebKit only, but eventually got standardized.                             |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=871.72)  | Whereas the others that we've covered here have not taken that path.                                   |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=875.32)  | Interesting.                                                                                           |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=876.32)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=877.32)  | I wonder what the use cases would be for this.                                                         |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=879.48)  | I guess if you don't want someone to copy something, that is a use case.                               |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=883.52)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=884.52)  | I think that's a native hybrid scenario where I don't think native apps get that by default.           |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=889.12)  | I think they have to opt in to copying text.                                                           |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=891.58)  | And so that's something, again, I would do in my hybrid applications.                                  |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=894.34)  | I would remove all these indicators that someone was on a webpage so that the illusion was             |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=899.12)  | closer to native.                                                                                      |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=900.12)  | Wow.                                                                                                   |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=901.12)  | I'm always annoyed when I want to copy something and I can't.                                          |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=903.28)  | So that is interesting that it is default on native apps.                                              |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=907.4)   | I wouldn't assume that.                                                                                |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=908.92)  | Different environment, right?                                                                          |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=909.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=910.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=911.92)  | All right.                                                                                             |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=912.92)  | So we're going to stop scrolling now because scrolling is a touch interaction.                         |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=915.76)  | We do have an entire episode on scroll, so we're not going to get too deep into scrolling.             |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=920.58)  | We cover a lot of things like smooth scroll and scroll points and all those fun things                 |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=926.9)   | in our scroll episode, which is, let's see.                                                            |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=931.0)   | Overflow episode 34.                                                                                   |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=932.56)  | Overflow, we talked about scrolling a lot.                                                             |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=934.92)  | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=935.92)  | So definitely check out episode 34 for more on that.                                                   |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=938.32)  | Another fun little WebKit property is WebKit Overflow Scrolling.                                       |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=942.72)  | This is WebKit only.                                                                                   |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=944.04)  | And so this is also another nonstandard cross browser feature that works on WebKit based               |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=948.3)   | browsers like Safari.                                                                                  |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=950.52)  | And setting this property to touch gives you momentum scrolling.                                       |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=957.96)  | So if you do dash WebKit dash overflow dash scrolling colon touch, then you get this nice              |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=964.34)  | accelerated bouncy scroll UX.                                                                          |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=966.8)   | There's only two values here.                                                                          |
| [16:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=968.44)  | There's auto and touch.                                                                                |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=969.44)  | Auto doesn't give you that flingy UX, it's just when you move a scroll bar, it kind of                 |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=973.96)  | moves along with you.                                                                                  |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=975.44)  | But you can add a little pizzazz to that with WebKit Overflow Scrolling and the touch value            |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=980.76)  | for it.                                                                                                |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=981.76)  | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=982.76)  | This property has a nasty history and I'm happy to report it's gone.                                   |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=986.16)  | I don't think you need WebKit Overflow Scrolling anymore.                                              |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=988.3)   | They got rid of it in Safari 14 or 13 where it's now the default.                                      |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=994.12)  | So everything will overflow scrolling touch.                                                           |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=996.08)  | Oh, nice.                                                                                              |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=997.08)  | Then why is this even on our list?                                                                     |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=998.08)  | We don't need this.                                                                                    |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=999.08)  | You know what's on here to tell people?                                                                |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1000.36) | You don't need it anymore.                                                                             |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1002.36) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1003.84) | And I'm actually looking at the overflow scrolling just like namespace and that's kind of interesting. |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1010.76) | I wonder if we could non-standardize it and start getting into because we have overscroll              |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1015.32) | behavior which we're going to talk about in a second which is about chaining.                          |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1018.72) | But then you have like overflow or overscroll hint.                                                    |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1021.42) | Like what happens as you're trying to pull at the edge, right?                                         |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1023.48) | Get that like elastic effect.                                                                          |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1024.84) | I remember that was a really big thing when that first came out because people would style             |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1029.48) | like the overflow by like making it a little bit more colorful to match the page or trying             |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1035.58) | to get that effect that came out.                                                                      |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1038.0)  | I don't even remember what year it came out but it was that pull to refresh style and                  |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1042.0)  | people were starting to customize that to fit in the vibe of their apps.                               |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1045.44) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                              |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1046.44) | That was like iScroll4.                                                                                |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1047.44) | There's like a widget that everyone used because on iOS if you didn't have WebKit Overflow             |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1051.76) | scrolling touch on there you had to use two fingers to scroll an overflow auto zone.                   |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1057.72) | And most users on iOS didn't know that you needed two fingers to scroll the zone especially            |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1062.24) | with there's no anyway it was a mess.                                                                  |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1064.36) | And now it's better.                                                                                   |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1065.36) | So that's kind of the good news is like well this used to be something you have to think               |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1067.68) | about.                                                                                                 |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1068.68) | Not anymore.                                                                                           |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1069.68) | I'm sorry for like adding that little note on there but I thought I'd put that into our                |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1073.04) | doc earlier and I guess I had forgotten.                                                               |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1075.24) | So I'm sorry.                                                                                          |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1076.24) | It also doesn't really say it on the docs I was looking at MDN that this is now part                   |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1081.2)  | of a default but maybe I just missed it.                                                               |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1084.32) | So we should go contribute.                                                                            |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1085.32) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [18:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1086.32) | Well, I'll check that out after this episode.                                                          |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1087.32) | All right.                                                                                             |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1088.32) | Our next one on here on scroll is for touch is scroll snap and scroll snap stop.                       |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1093.34) | So these two properties are a great way to add some touch and some really nice native                  |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1097.48) | flings from native throwing some really great scroll experiences as you're sort of articulating        |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1102.4)  | where are appropriate places to stop so that the UI and the design look really nice.                   |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1106.6)  | It's great for touch.                                                                                  |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1107.72) | I think it's best for touch.                                                                           |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1109.72) | I think desktop is the one that's sort of like oh scroll snap.                                         |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1112.28) | That's fine.                                                                                           |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1113.28) | I have a stepped mouse.                                                                                |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1114.28) | That's not great.                                                                                      |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1115.28) | But on touch it's just nice.                                                                           |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1116.44) | It feels very native.                                                                                  |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1117.76) | No JavaScript required system provided super smooth works across all the different platforms           |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1122.96) | and use snap stop scroll snap stop if it should step through the scroller like a carousel              |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1127.16) | right if you want someone to stop one by one or every three you can set these stop spots               |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1131.62) | and so no matter how hard someone flings you know fling with a thousand strengths and it               |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1136.76) | would still stop at that item and you can use over scroll behavior to stop scroll chaining.            |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1140.88) | Oh I guess that's next here.                                                                           |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1142.6)  | Tell us about over scroll behavior.                                                                    |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1143.9)  | But wait I found the WebKit or a flow scrolling thing.                                                 |
| [19:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1146.7)  | It is in like a little link in the C more and it was released in Safari 13.                            |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1152.44) | So that was September 2019 which now is everywhere.                                                    |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1158.76) | Ouch.                                                                                                  |
| [19:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1159.76) | Yes.                                                                                                   |

| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1161.76) | So yeah I found it.                                                                                    |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1162.76) | Cool.                                                                                                  |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1163.76) | Thank you.                                                                                             |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1164.76) | Okay so let's talk about scroll chaining over scroll behavior as you just kind of introduce            |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1170.44) | us to if a user you know throws really hard scrolls pretty far you get this excess inertia.            |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1177.9)  | So the question here is do you leave the container and enter the next parent scroller.                 |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1183.34) | For example if you're in a vertical scroll bar like you're in a select menu and you've                 |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1188.1)  | scrolled to the end of that list because you did like a fling do we want to continue scrolling         |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1192.24) | to the next scroller which is probably the page scroller.                                              |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1195.48) | That's the default page behavior but sometimes we don't want that.                                     |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1198.52) | We want to stop at the end of that select menu instead of move on and scroll the page.                 |
| [20:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1204.14) | So you can set over scroll behavior to contain or none to stop that behavior.                          |
| [20:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1210.78) | This prevents the scroll from moving forward kind of like you know event bubbling scroll               |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1214.76) | event bubbling for the inertia that you have when you're doing a fling or the side to side.            |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1221.32) | This is also something that you might experience with carousels.                                       |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1224.68) | You know sometimes if you go too far one way like kind of like the whole screen will move              |
| [20:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1228.24) | you know like we were just talking about the overflow directional thing like oh you've                 |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1232.14) | hit the edge.                                                                                          |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1233.14) | I like that pattern that behavior pattern that kind of like tells you to stop like you've              |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1237.06) | done that.                                                                                             |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1238.06) | But anyway you can stop this by using the over scroll behavior property.                               |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1242.66) | Nice and Safari just shipped that too I think it was they were lagging behind and now it's             |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1247.58) | now it's everywhere and I think that adds a nice like especially feel like a side menu                 |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1251.24) | like where you know you hit the hamburger side menu folds out and you can scroll that.                 |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1255.44) | That one's really common that you'll be able to scroll the side menu and then as you scroll            |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1258.86) | to the top of it it starts to scroll the page behind it and you're like ew I'm scrolling               |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1262.94) | the sidebar not the page.                                                                              |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1265.16) | Why is this leaking into there and anyway that sidebar just needs over scroll behavior.                |
| [21:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1270.06) | Our last little scroll tip here this one's not a CSS property but it's a concept called                |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1274.58) | the root scroller.                                                                                     |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1276.0)  | So there's two different types of scrollers on your page.                                              |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1278.4)  | There's one root scroller and then a whole bunch of nested scrollers and the root scroller             |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1282.68) | gets some special special effects and that's typically like the HTML element or the body               |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1287.7)  | element that's scrolling but you can promote your own.                                                 |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1289.68) | I think we've talked about promotion to root scrollers but anyway when you have a root                 |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1292.94) | scroller it gets the over scroll effect so that's the bounce or stretch at the edges.                  |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1297.42) | Stretch is now what it is in Android S but bounce has been the traditional WebKit provided             |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1302.76) | effect and iOS you now get that for the root and nested scrollers too right.                           |
| [21:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1306.66) | So we just talked about that you don't have to add over scroll or overflow scrolling touch             |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1310.86) | you just kind of get the over scroll effect for free on all your scrollers you know your               |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1315.82) | nested ones and the root one but on Android it's only the root scroller that gets this                 |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1319.3)  | effect.                                                                                                |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1320.34) | Then the scroll hint is also only on the root scroller so this would be like shadows or                |
| [22:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1324.34) | motion to signal that there's more surface area.                                                       |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1326.9)  | So right a scroll hint.                                                                                |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1328.38) | Yeah I like that pattern too.                                                                          |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1330.58) | Me too and then the pull to refresh UX so your root scroller gets that effect also where               |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1336.2)  | when you're at the top and you continue pulling you'll see the native UI for refreshing the            |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1340.38) | page or just refreshing that scroller.                                                                 |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1342.74) | API is to come to that eventually I'm sure but yeah that's the root scroller and some                  |
| [22:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1346.9)  | of the superpowers it gets on the web.                                                                 |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1348.9)  | Yeah and as I was kind of describing earlier that overflow behavior that is because you've             |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1354.18) | now entered the root scroller and you're seeing the page tell you where you are in like the            |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1358.1)  | geometric map of that page.                                                                            |
| [22:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1359.86) | Good call.                                                                                             |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1361.22) | So let's move on to media queries because you can use media queries in kind of the same                |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1365.9)  | way that you could use supports to check for you know if you're on a mobile touch enabled              |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1374.26) | device so you know you can check if something's a pointer device or it can be hovered with             |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1380.3)  | a few different media queries and the first one is hover so you could do at media and                  |
| [23:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1385.02) | then check for hovering do hover colon hover and that means you can hover the content but              |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1389.26) | if you do at media hover none that means you can't hover and it likely is a touch based                |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1395.58) | device and then you can style accordingly so if you wanted to do any particular styles                 |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1401.34) | that are only for a touch interaction or maybe you're creating a bigger surface area for               |
| [23:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1407.56) | touch or maybe you're doing some kind of other interactive bits or styling bits to improve             |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1413.28) | the user experience on touch devices you can use these media queries to specify those styles.          |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1421.32) | Exactly yeah and so on in a like a complementary one to hover is this pointer because they             |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1425.98) | don't want to tell you what kind of pointer right that would be a fingerprinting vector                |
| [23:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1429.42) | so it's more like how accurate is it is what we can query and so yeah we can query the                 |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1434.54) | pointer to see if it's coarse which would mean it's not a very fine pointer ready to                   |
| [24:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1440.94) | be a loose one so it's probably like a potato or a finger would be a coarse pointer but                |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1445.9)  | then you can have pointer fine which would be like a mouse right and this is like a very               |
| [24:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1449.94) | fine pointer and then the kind of kicker on these is you can also say any pointer so at                |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1455.7)  | media open parentheses any hover and any pointer and pass a value in there and that will check         |
| [24:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1461.06) | to see all of the input types that is like does any of the input types of this device                  |
| [24:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1465.82) | supports have hover and that could be something like your iPad doesn't have hover but it does          |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1471.54) | have a stylus that can hover and so you would use any pointer font or like fine at that                |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1478.38) | point anyway so it's just like finer green control and the ability to sort of like expand              |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1482.42) | or contract your pointer support query here yeah good call so we're actually at the end                |
| [24:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1487.88) | of our touch interaction show there are lots of things to talk about we probably didn't                |
| [24:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1493.78) | cover all of them but again definitely check out the overflow episode that's episode 34                |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5x85WPhwm9GY2fQVoT7IoT?&t=1500.02) | where we do talk a lot about scrolling and how that kind of enters different realms that's             |
