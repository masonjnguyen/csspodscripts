| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.         |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=17.32)  | Let's get specific about specificity.                                                            |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=19.5)   | In our last episode, we talked about all the different ways you can select elements in           |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=23.42)  | order to apply style declarations to them.                                                       |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=26.26)  | But what happens when multiple selectors target the same subject?                                |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=29.26)  | Oh, well what happens when two different teams want to play basketball against each other?       |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=34.04)  | They play a game!                                                                                |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=35.04)  | Okay, that didn't quite work, but I was like, but wait, this sounds like a head-to-head          |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=40.36)  | match.                                                                                           |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=41.36)  | Like this could totally be like UFC, like my selector versus your selector.                      |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=44.28)  | We'll see who has a stronger fist.                                                               |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=46.62)  | But the sad thing is that that actually happens in teams where you have to override other        |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=50.38)  | people's code and it becomes a whole mess of things.                                             |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=52.72)  | And that's where important comes in and we don't want to go there.                               |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=55.12)  | I agree.                                                                                         |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=56.12)  | Wait, this is getting a little too real, huh?                                                    |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=58.92)  | Well, hey, so yeah, okay, we'll go back to the question.                                         |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=62.6)   | This is like multiple selectors targeting the same subject.                                      |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=65.52)  | What happens?                                                                                    |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=66.52)  | Like how's the browser do that?                                                                  |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=67.52)  | And I totally get it.                                                                            |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=68.52)  | Like the browser needs a way to resolve this conflict.                                           |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=70.48)  | And it does so with a calculation called specificity.                                            |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=73.78)  | Think of specificity like a way to determine which selector's intent is more specific than       |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=78.52)  | another.                                                                                         |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=79.52)  | And we learned previously about type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, you know, and     |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=83.76)  | etc.                                                                                             |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=84.76)  | You can go check out the last episode, episode two, if you haven't yet.                          |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=87.4)   | And specificity gives each of those a strength.                                                  |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=90.76)  | The universal selector, for example, has no strength, while an ID selector has three times       |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=96.2)   | that strength.                                                                                   |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=97.2)   | It has some people like to think of like an ID selector gives you 100 points, whereas            |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=101.6)  | like a universal selector would give you zero.                                                   |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=104.2)  | So like all in all, there's five different points to earn in the specificity game and            |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=108.68) | multiple ways to accrue them.                                                                    |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=110.66) | And let's talk about these points, talk about how the game works, and then play a game.          |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=116.32) | So before we play the game, we have to talk about the rules.                                     |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=120.96) | And the general rules of the selector game are as follows.                                       |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=124.24) | And you can think of these as buckets or values.                                                 |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=126.52) | I like to imagine like a vintage signboard where the values tick up independently, because       |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=131.0)  | that's kind of how we're going to be counting these up.                                          |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=133.26) | So like Adam alluded to, that universal selector gives you zero points.                          |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=137.4)  | That has no specific value.                                                                      |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=139.32) | That is the least specific type of selector.                                                     |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=142.16) | So that's zero.                                                                                  |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=143.56) | Now if you have an element or a pseudo element, you'll get one point.                            |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=147.26) | So that column all the way to the right will tick up by one.                                     |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=151.28) | If you have a class, pseudo class, or an attribute selector, you get 10 points.                  |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=156.34) | So the column next to that will tick up by one.                                                  |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=159.14) | So that's 10 points for that type of selector.                                                   |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=162.34) | Now with an ID, because the ID has three times the strength, you get 100 points.                 |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=167.12) | And you could tick up the column that's three from the left.                                     |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=170.82) | So you could think of it that way.                                                               |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=172.58) | With inline styles, if you write the style inline with your HTML, so you're writing your         |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=178.2)  | CSS inside that HTML, you get 1,000 points.                                                      |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=181.16) | That's going to be even more specific.                                                           |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=183.16) | So that is going to tick up the fourth column from the left.                                     |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=186.2)  | That's 1,000 points.                                                                             |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=188.14) | And finally, if you have an important tag on your style, that's going to override all            |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=193.8)  | of these things and give you 10,000 points.                                                      |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=196.64) | So that's going to be that fifth column from the left ticking up by one.                         |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=200.9)  | You get 10,000 points for that important style.                                                  |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=204.08) | That was an awesome explanation.                                                                 |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=206.4)  | And I just want to make a couple visuals to help it ring true maybe, which is, okay, let's       |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=210.6)  | say we have three classes in a selector.                                                         |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=214.54) | That would mean they're each worth 10 points.                                                    |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=217.64) | And I get 30 points.                                                                             |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=218.8)  | So that's the specificity of a selector with three classes is 30.                                |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=223.24) | But if I add in a type selector in there, like if I say anchor dot class space class             |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=228.44) | class, so I have three classes and one type, I have one point for a type element selector.       |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=236.52) | And then I have three of my class element selectors for 10 points each.                          |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=241.0)  | And that gives me 31 points.                                                                     |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=243.28) | So it's a little bit more specific.                                                              |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=245.52) | So with that sort of like base knowledge, we're going to try to go nuts and see if we            |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=248.68) | could do some more crazier selectors.                                                            |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=251.3)  | Another thing to note is that selectors inside of a knot are counted like any other, but         |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=257.2)  | the knot itself doesn't count.                                                                   |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=259.12) | So if you have like div colon knot and a class inside of there, that class will count.           |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=265.52) | You'll get the 10 points for the class, but you won't get any points for having that knot        |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=269.98) | negation logical property in there.                                                              |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=272.28) | Totally.                                                                                         |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=273.28) | And let's talk about like a couple of edge cases because games always have edge cases.           |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=276.68) | So let's say both teams, they scored the same specificity.                                       |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=280.86) | So their selectors are different, but they have the same specificity.                            |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=285.52) | How does the browser resolve that issue?                                                         |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=287.16) | It looks for the newest change, which should be at the bottom of the file or the last place      |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=293.6)  | that the CSS was written that would be at the equal level of the previous selector.              |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=297.68) | Totally.                                                                                         |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=298.68) | In this game mentality, does that mean like you shot last?                                       |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=300.78) | It's like you took turns shooting and you were just the last shooter or something?               |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=303.92) | I don't know.                                                                                    |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=304.92) | I guess that's how it works, but it is kind of funny with games.                                 |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=307.04) | So I feel like we'd have some overtime there.                                                    |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=308.84) | Speaking of games, let's play the game.                                                          |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=312.6)  | Yeah, I want to play the game really bad, but there's like a fun hack and it's that              |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=316.24) | if you repeat a class name, so like this is really dumb, but it works and it's like a            |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=320.64) | way to cheat the game.                                                                           |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=321.68) | So if I have like an anchor and I put a class on it called lol and then that's my HTML and       |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=328.92) | my CSS, if I say a.lol.lol.lol.lol, I got 40 points for all those classes, even though           |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=336.4)  | it's not matching more elements or less elements or anything like that.                          |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=340.0)  | All it's doing is gaming specificity.                                                            |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=342.46) | And that's fun.                                                                                  |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=343.46) | You can name it and maybe you've gamed it before in these battles with your coworkers.           |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=347.32) | I've never done that, but that's such a fun fact.                                                |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=350.0)  | I agree.                                                                                         |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=351.0)  | Just add them up.                                                                                |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=352.0)  | That does make it more specific, so it wouldn't be the last rule.                                |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=354.48) | It would be the most specific rule, which adds classes.                                          |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=357.08) | Interesting.                                                                                     |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=358.08) | So you don't have to actually add them to the HTML, just to the CSS.                             |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=360.64) | Just to CSS.                                                                                     |

| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=362.64) | So, okay.                                                                                        |

| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=364.64) | Oh, I'm ready to play the game.                                                                  |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=365.9)  | For those listening at home, play along and pause the podcast to calculate the score.            |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=370.92) | What we're going to do is I'm going to ask Adam a question of what would the specificity         |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=375.84) | of a subject be, and then he'll answer it.                                                       |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=379.48) | So if you want to play along, do a little pause, calculate it yourself, and then see             |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=382.28) | if you got the right answer.                                                                     |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=383.28) | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                      |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=384.28) | Let's play.                                                                                      |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=385.28) | Cool.                                                                                            |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=386.28) | So let's get started with an easy one.                                                           |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=388.08) | What is the specificity of that star selector?                                                   |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=390.7)  | The universal selector that we talked about has no points.                                       |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=395.08) | So there's no classes, no elements, no IDs, no inline styles.                                    |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=399.96) | So everything's a zero across the board.                                                         |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=401.8)  | That is a zero specificity selector.                                                             |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=404.08) | Yep.                                                                                             |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=405.08) | Awesome.                                                                                         |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=406.08) | I got the easy one.                                                                              |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=407.08) | Okay, I'm just going to quit now.                                                                |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=408.08) | I'll pull a Costanza.                                                                            |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=409.08) | Is that cool?                                                                                    |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=410.08) | While you're winning.                                                                            |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=411.08) | Just kidding.                                                                                    |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=412.08) | All right, Yuna.                                                                                 |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=413.08) | Okay.                                                                                            |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=414.08) | I have a P selector, a selector with the letter P in it.                                         |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=417.64) | Okay, so just the P. That is a element.                                                          |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=421.04) | So that's going to be one point.                                                                 |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=422.86) | And that's it.                                                                                   |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=423.86) | One.                                                                                             |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=424.86) | Specificity of one.                                                                              |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=425.86) | Specificity of one.                                                                              |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=426.86) | That is correct.                                                                                 |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=427.86) | Well done.                                                                                       |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=428.86) | Okay.                                                                                            |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=429.86) | So now you have a main space dot header.                                                         |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=434.6)  | Okay.                                                                                            |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=435.6)  | So dot header is a class.                                                                        |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=438.64) | Main is an element.                                                                              |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=440.76) | So one class is worth 10 points.                                                                 |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=442.82) | So if I just work left to right, actually, so I have a type selector at one point for            |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=446.56) | main and 10 points for the dot header.                                                           |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=449.92) | I'm looking at 11 points in total for that selector in specificity.                              |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=453.76) | How did I do?                                                                                    |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=454.76) | Yep.                                                                                             |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=455.76) | You got it.                                                                                      |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=456.76) | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=457.76) | It feels good being right.                                                                       |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=458.76) | All right, Yuna.                                                                                 |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=460.6)  | Here's one a little trickier.                                                                    |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=462.2)  | These are going to kind of get progressively trickier, I suppose.                                |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=464.68) | Oh, maybe not.                                                                                   |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=465.68) | Okay, anyway, this one is hashtag nav.                                                           |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=468.24) | So ID nav space UL space LI.                                                                     |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=471.96) | Okay, so this is going to be a list item and I have an ordered list inside of a navigation       |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=478.52) | section with an ID of nav.                                                                       |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=480.44) | So I am going to start with thinking about this as like ID.                                      |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=484.26) | That's 100 points.                                                                               |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=485.64) | And then we have UL LI, which are both individual elements.                                      |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=489.6)  | So those are going to be two points.                                                             |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=491.32) | So it's going to be 102 when we combine those together.                                          |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=494.52) | That is correct.                                                                                 |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=495.52) | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=496.52) | Very nice.                                                                                       |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=497.52) | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=498.52) | Okay, let's think about some attributes.                                                         |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=501.8)  | What if we had a colon active?                                                                   |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=504.72) | Okay, so a is a type selector, an element of one point and active is a pseudo class,             |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=513.36) | not a pseudo element because it's not referencing something physical.                            |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=517.04) | It's representing something stateful.                                                            |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=520.52) | So we have 10 points for a pseudo class and one point for a type element.                        |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=526.04) | We're looking at a specificity score of 11.                                                      |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=528.68) | Yes.                                                                                             |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=529.68) | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=530.68) | All right.                                                                                       |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=531.68) | Well, here's a tricky twist.                                                                     |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=534.24) | On that one, we have an A. So this is for you.                                                   |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=537.08) | We have an anchor colon not open parentheses, colon active, end parentheses.                     |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=543.96) | So basically an anchor that is not active.                                                       |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=546.24) | What is the specificity of that?                                                                 |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=548.48) | Okay, so there is that note that I mentioned about the not selector not counting towards         |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=554.48) | the specificity, but that active attribute does count.                                           |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=559.08) | Well, the active pseudo class, I mean, I keep calling it a pseudo class.                         |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=562.52) | So that would be the same specificity as a colon active, which would be 11.                      |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=569.12) | And this is where you kind of have to think about the order of your CSS.                         |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=573.04) | So I'm going to say that this is an 11 in terms of specificity, which is the same as             |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=578.16) | a colon active.                                                                                  |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=579.32) | That is a really good point.                                                                     |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=580.52) | If we had done this in our style sheets where the a colon not active was before the a colon      |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=586.0)  | active, we might be frustrated why our not active styles weren't applying.                       |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=590.32) | Yep.                                                                                             |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=591.32) | It's because it came down to latest rule wins.                                                   |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=593.64) | Interesting.                                                                                     |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=594.64) | Good call.                                                                                       |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=595.64) | So all right, I'm going to give you a long one.                                                  |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=597.44) | Envision this.                                                                                   |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=598.44) | Let's say you have article space a dot outbound colon not and then in parentheses colon visited. |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=610.24) | So I'll repeat that for you.                                                                     |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=612.24) | Article a dot outbound colon not in parentheses colon visited.                                   |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=620.0)  | OK, so this is like a tricky play on our previous two.                                           |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=624.16) | So we had a not visited link, but this one also had a class on it.                               |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=628.68) | OK, so let's I'm going to work from the left to right.                                           |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=630.88) | So we have an article that's one of type element.                                                |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=633.72) | So that's 10 points or no, it's one point.                                                       |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=635.88) | OK, wait, one point for an element.                                                              |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=638.44) | OK, then we have an anchor, which is another one point element.                                  |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=642.52) | So I'm looking at two points.                                                                    |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=644.6)  | Then we have dot outbound.                                                                       |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=646.0)  | So we have a class that's 10 points.                                                             |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=647.92) | I'm looking at 12 and we have not visited.                                                       |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=651.96) | Not doesn't score anything.                                                                      |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=654.22) | Visited is a pseudo class.                                                                       |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=655.56) | It's worth 10 points as previously at 12.                                                        |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=657.54) | That puts me at 22 points of specificity.                                                        |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=660.08) | Yes, you got it.                                                                                 |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=661.08) | Even though that one was long and a little bit more complicated.                                 |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=664.16) | It's exactly 22 points.                                                                          |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=665.68) | That's right.                                                                                    |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=666.68) | Awesome.                                                                                         |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=667.68) | Well, let's cap our game off with just a silly reminder of how to game specificity.              |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=671.64) | If I've got an anchor that has the law class on it four times, what's my specificity of          |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=676.8)  | that anchor?                                                                                     |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=677.8)  | Four times.                                                                                      |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=678.8)  | So you're using the same class four times just to increase the specificity of that element.      |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=683.28) | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=684.28) | OK, so then if you have four classes, regardless of what they are, that's a specificity of       |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=688.56) | 40.                                                                                              |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=689.56) | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=690.56) | Right.                                                                                           |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=691.56) | And then you're applying that also to an element which has specificity of one.                   |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=694.64) | So I'm going to say that that's a specificity of 41.                                             |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=698.12) | That is correct.                                                                                 |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=699.12) | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=700.12) | OK, well, I don't have any more questions for you.                                               |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=702.48) | I feel like that was a pretty solid game.                                                        |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=704.44) | Yeah, I went really well.                                                                        |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=705.64) | You scored well.                                                                                 |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=706.64) | I hope you all did good in the game in the car.                                                  |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=708.64) | I mean, it's a little tough to imagine, but maybe go back and check it out again.                |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=712.4)  | I felt like as soon as I scored things and got into this game, a lot of this technicality        |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=718.42) | around specificity just kind of disappeared and made me really happy playing this.               |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=722.12) | So hopefully you all were able to enjoy that in the car at home.                                 |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=725.12) | And if you have any CSS questions about this, we'd love to answer them.                          |

| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2I3gJ9AFUi08Sm9CV7wydO?&t=740.8)  | And practice the specificity because it actually really helps and helps you understand these     |
