| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=17.04)   | Today we're talking about text and typography, specifically CSS text and font properties             |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=22.68)   | like text decoration and font weight.                                                                |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=25.14)   | There are of course other properties like color, which affect the text color and line                |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=30.0)    | height, which affect the paragraph spacing and block axis.                                           |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=33.12)   | And there are letter properties like letter spacing, which is something that I always                |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=36.66)   | tend to use when I increase the font weight and set the text transform to uppercase, because         |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=41.08)   | it makes it look a lot nicer when you have a little bit more spacing there.                          |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=44.72)   | But there are lots of text effects and we're going to cover nearly all of them, at least             |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=50.5)    | the ones that are well supported and just dive right in.                                             |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=53.12)   | There's a ton to go over, so we're going to go pretty quickly one by one and talk about              |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=57.84)   | all these different text effects.                                                                    |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=60.36)   | Excellent introduction.                                                                              |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=61.54)   | We're going to start with classic font properties.                                                   |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=64.56)   | So these are ones that you've probably heard of that aren't brand new and very reliable              |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=68.62)   | in terms of usage.                                                                                   |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=69.62)   | And the first one is font style.                                                                     |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=72.48)   | And this lets us tap into the typeface and choose a specific alternative font.                       |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=77.14)   | So by default, the font style is normal, but you can pass italic.                                    |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=81.44)   | And if you say font style italic, it will look into the typeface and try to find an                  |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=84.84)   | italic font if it's there.                                                                           |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=86.84)   | If there isn't one, it'll fall back to the oblique font.                                             |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=89.82)   | And if the oblique font is not even there, it will try to artificially create one for                |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=94.36)   | you.                                                                                                 |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=95.36)   | So it's kind of funny, font style, italic and oblique both have these fallback systems               |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=99.44)   | that eventually fall back to a fake one or a sort of artificially created one.                       |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=104.72)  | Anyway, it could be really nice.                                                                     |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=106.18)  | Maybe it's not, but give it some testing.                                                            |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=107.96)  | Yeah, so then we have font weight, which has a few different values.                                 |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=111.56)  | You could set the weight to things like normal, bold, extra bold.                                    |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=114.16)  | There's these keyword values that you can set, or you can use a numeric value.                       |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=118.32)  | So this is anything from like 100 to 900.                                                            |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=122.52)  | Increments of 100 work for the majority of typefaces.                                                |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=126.12)  | The typeface, of course, has to have an option in that font weight.                                  |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=129.72)  | Not all font weights are supported in all typefaces.                                                 |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=133.56)  | But there's also variable fonts, which let you pick anything sort of between the 100                 |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=139.88)  | and 900 range, where you could have values like 115 or like 730 or like any of those                 |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=147.1)   | types of values.                                                                                     |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=148.16)  | There's also relative values for font weight, like lighter and bolder.                               |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=152.0)   | And these set the elements boldness to be either one step lighter, like thinner or heavier,          |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=158.52)  | which is bolder than its parent elements font weight.                                                |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=161.8)   | So I thought that that was really interesting because I've never really used these.                  |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=164.32)  | I usually set a numeric value specifically, and I put that into custom properties and                |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=169.32)  | have that kind of be like a theme amongst my UI.                                                     |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=173.5)   | I just learned that, that those were relative.                                                       |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=175.96)  | I've been using those absolutely in my mind for years.                                               |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=179.8)   | You'll find lighter is all over old projects of mine.                                                |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=183.8)   | Interesting.                                                                                         |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=184.8)   | I didn't know that was contextual to the context of its usage.                                       |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=187.36)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=188.36)  | Wow, thank you.                                                                                      |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=189.36)  | The next one we put in here is font synthesis.                                                       |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=192.56)  | And as we discussed earlier that the browser will try to create a fallback for you in case           |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=197.08)  | it can't find one.                                                                                   |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=198.18)  | You can opt out of that with font synthesis.                                                         |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=201.34)  | And that's where you can pass in which ones you don't want it to fall back and maybe you             |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=204.92)  | just don't want it to fall back at all.                                                              |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=206.68)  | And it's currently supported in Firefox and Safari.                                                  |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=209.76)  | Next we have text transform and the values for this are none, which is no transform,                 |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=214.64)  | the default.                                                                                         |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=215.64)  | And there's uppercase, which sets all the text to capital letters.                                   |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=218.76)  | There's lowercase, which sets all the text to lowercase letters.                                     |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=221.84)  | This is actually good if you wanted to do something like display, I don't know, usernames            |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=226.32)  | in all lowercase.                                                                                    |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=227.32)  | Like you could, there are use cases for lowercase.                                                   |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=229.96)  | There's also capitalize, which capitalizes the first letter of every word.                           |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=234.68)  | So maybe like a title.                                                                               |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=236.3)   | And then there's also full width, which transforms all the glyphs into a fixed width square,         |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=243.04)  | like a monospace font.                                                                               |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=244.16)  | And this is primarily used for alignment with East Asian language glyphs.                            |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=249.24)  | So none, uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, full width, all the options for text transform.           |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=253.32)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=254.32)  | Next is text decoration.                                                                             |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=255.96)  | And this shorthand lets you set line position, like underline, overline, or through.                 |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=260.32)  | The line color and the styles, like dashed, wavy, or solid, and the thickness all in one             |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=265.96)  | go.                                                                                                  |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=266.96)  | So it's shorthand for all of those.                                                                  |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=268.28)  | And the common values are none or underline or overline, but you can combine them and                |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=273.48)  | use the shorthand and kind of make a nice little fun text decoration.                                |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=277.04)  | And here's one, for example, hot pink, wavy overline.                                                |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=280.52)  | Wow, fancy.                                                                                          |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=283.96)  | So we also have the color value, as I mentioned at the top of the show.                              |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=286.72)  | And color can be any color value for a text color, including things that have alpha transparency,    |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=292.16)  | so partial transparency, or you could use transparent as the color keyword, which you                |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=296.72)  | do have to use for something like gradient text.                                                     |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=299.36)  | And if we're doing like a clip to make an effect happen, check out our last show on                  |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=304.76)  | Overflow to learn more about that and the text tricks there.                                         |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=309.92)  | But there's also current color as a keyword for color, which takes the color from the                |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=314.0)   | parent and that allows you to sort of trickle down color values as one of the first CSS              |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=320.2)   | variables that you can use.                                                                          |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=321.76)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=322.76)  | Yep, that one's really cool.                                                                         |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=323.76)  | And then we have letter spacing.                                                                     |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=325.38)  | And what's interesting about letter spacing is this is often used in CSS as a kerning                |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=329.32)  | strategy, but it is not kerning.                                                                     |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=332.04)  | The more I've learned about this, it is more like letter box width is what you're changing.          |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=337.68)  | Just kind of an interesting difference is if you have all the letters are shrink wrapped             |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=341.8)   | and have different widths, this is not the space between those boxes.                                |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=345.14)  | This is just the generic size of the box for each letter.                                            |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=348.56)  | And it accepts lengths.                                                                              |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=350.16)  | And I really like to pass it Ms or characters, you know, some sort of relative values that           |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=354.16)  | the letter spacing is relative to the current font size.                                             |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=356.76)  | Yeah, that's a good idea.                                                                            |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=358.0)   | And this is one that I do use a lot, as I mentioned also earlier, especially when I'm                |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=362.8)   | using uppercase letters to give a little bit more breathing room to the typography.                  |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=367.2)   | But definitely, it's usually a very small number.                                                    |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=370.28)  | So I'm using like point zero zero, etc. for this.                                                    |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=374.04)  | Next, we have text indent.                                                                           |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=376.14)  | And this lets you indent the first line of text like a paragraph and this accepts a length           |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=381.8)   | or percentage so you can use Ms here, rems, or some sort of percent relative to the typeface.        |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=388.6)   | Or negative 909,975 pixels.                                                                          |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=391.92)  | Yeah, well, this was used as a hack to hide text and keep some like some label on the                |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=400.88)  | text in the icon for accessibility purposes.                                                         |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=405.4)   | You'd have to use text indent because we didn't have all this area labeled by and all those          |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=409.46)  | fancy things yet.                                                                                    |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=410.46)  | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                          |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=411.46)  | So it's fun that that is gone out of our styles.                                                     |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=414.0)   | The next one we have is text overflow.                                                               |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=415.96)  | And this is how text overflows into space.                                                           |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=418.56)  | And we had a previous episode on that.                                                               |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=420.4)   | So check that one out to see.                                                                        |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=422.16)  | Next we have whitespace.                                                                             |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=423.4)   | So whitespace has a few different values that we can put here.                                       |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=426.72)  | Normal, no wrap, pre, pre wrap, pre line and break spaces.                                           |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=432.12)  | And there are some interesting nuances between these.                                                |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=436.56)  | So with normal, with new lines, you would collapse them and also no wrap.                            |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=442.5)   | With no wrap, that's the one where no matter what, you're not wrapping.                              |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=446.28)  | So you're going to have a straight line all across.                                                  |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=447.8)   | And you might want to use that if you wanted to have something like a title that overflows           |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=452.56)  | just one line and then maybe use like text overflow ellipses to show that there's more,              |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=456.56)  | but make sure that it doesn't wrap ever.                                                             |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=459.32)  | There's pre and pre wrap, which I tend to use with text that shows like code samples.                |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=466.36)  | So this would preserve spaces and tabs, new lines.                                                   |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=470.34)  | With pre, there's no wrapping, so it doesn't wrap, but it also preserves end of line spaces.         |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=476.34)  | With pre wrap, it would hang those end of line spaces and it would wrap while preserving             |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=481.08)  | the blocks, the blocks of code.                                                                      |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=484.44)  | And there's pre line, which is a little bit interesting because it kind of preserves new             |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=490.72)  | lines.                                                                                               |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=491.72)  | It collapses spaces and tabs.                                                                        |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=493.4)   | It wraps text, but it removes end of line spaces.                                                    |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=497.04)  | So it shifts the text around a little bit, unlike with pre wrap, which would hang those              |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=502.64)  | end of line spaces and would keep those preserved.                                                   |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=505.64)  | And then there's break spaces.                                                                       |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=507.76)  | And this one, it preserves new lines and spaces and tabs.                                            |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=512.16)  | It wraps the text and it wraps those end of line spaces also.                                        |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=516.72)  | So it looks pretty similar to pre wrap.                                                              |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=520.92)  | But there are these slight nuances between all of these.                                             |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=524.24)  | Honestly, the best way to explore which one's right for you is to test it out.                       |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=527.72)  | Usually you want pre or pre wrap for code blocks and then no wrap if you want to make                |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=533.0)   | sure that your text does not wrap to the next line.                                                  |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=535.64)  | Nice overview of a pretty complex thing that takes a little bit of juggling, especially              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=539.6)   | with the next one that we're talking about here, which is word break.                                |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=542.88)  | So that was white space and kind of how to handle white space.                                       |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=545.0)   | And this was how to handle words breaking onto new lines.                                            |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=548.08)  | And yeah, it's so much this stuff you just get for free and you don't have to think about            |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=552.0)   | it.                                                                                                  |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=553.0)   | But as soon as you do, these can get really handy to know how these work.                            |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=555.04)  | So word break here is like given a sentence with some really long words and a box that's             |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=560.76)  | too small for those words.                                                                           |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=562.16)  | How do you want to handle that?                                                                      |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=563.4)   | So normal, which has some like built in international intelligence word breaking behavior is the     |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=570.16)  | default.                                                                                             |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=571.2)   | But you can also specify to break all or keep all.                                                   |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=574.94)  | And if you specify break all, you're saying it's okay to split words into new lines.                 |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=578.28)  | Like if it's a really long word, it's okay.                                                          |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=581.12)  | Break it onto a new line.                                                                            |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=582.26)  | And then the second option here is keep all, which says no, never break a word.                      |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=586.36)  | Always keep my words together.                                                                       |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=588.32)  | The next one we have is line break.                                                                  |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=590.64)  | And this sets how new lines break for Chinese, Japanese and Korean when working with punctuation     |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=594.64)  | and symbols.                                                                                         |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=595.84)  | It takes values of auto, loose, normal, strict and anywhere.                                         |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=600.52)  | And if you're interested about line break, I would suggest go looking at the MDN documentation.      |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=604.26)  | They have great visuals and examples.                                                                |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=606.64)  | One that is similar to these breaking properties is also hyphens.                                    |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=610.76)  | So this describes how you want to showcase those words that are breaking or line break.              |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=616.5)   | So the values for hyphens are none, manual and auto.                                                 |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=619.84)  | None would be that words don't wrap to fill the space.                                               |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=622.2)   | They will overflow if necessary, if the box is too small and you have a sort of min content          |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=627.62)  | of that word overflowing the box, it's not going to wrap and there's not going to be                 |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=631.04)  | a hyphen.                                                                                            |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=632.04)  | There's also manual.                                                                                 |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=633.52)  | And this is something that I learned.                                                                |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=634.76)  | You can actually manually add soft hyphens or suggested line breaks with the shy, SHY,               |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=642.8)   | HTML character, like attribute.                                                                      |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=645.24)  | So you can put like and SHY colon.                                                                   |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=648.44)  | And that is something you'd put inside of words to suggest when that word can break.                 |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=653.12)  | And then if you set hyphens to manual, it will hyphenate only where those specific words             |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=658.6)   | are allowed to break and hyphenate onto the next line.                                               |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=662.16)  | So that's like a manual.                                                                             |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=663.56)  | Very cool.                                                                                           |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=664.56)  | Yeah, interesting.                                                                                   |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=665.56)  | Maybe for something like a poem or a something you need a lot of control over that could             |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=671.04)  | be that could be nice or like a title where you have less to handle.                                 |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=675.08)  | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                    |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=676.08)  | I wonder if this is something that is generally like author controlled.                              |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=679.42)  | So if you're writing the title, you put those shy spacers in there.                                  |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=682.96)  | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=683.96)  | That is so cool.                                                                                     |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=684.96)  | Yeah, you'd have to.                                                                                 |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=685.96)  | But then the last value for hyphens is auto.                                                         |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=687.96)  | And this would be the browser making that decision for you.                                          |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=690.78)  | So words would automatically hyphenate to fill the available space.                                  |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=694.32)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=695.32)  | Cool.                                                                                                |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=696.32)  | The next property is direction.                                                                      |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=697.52)  | And this controls the text direction of each word.                                                   |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=700.4)   | And by default, it is well, I'm not sure what the default value is.                                  |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=704.56)  | I think it's just whatever the browser is specifying in the user agent.                              |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=708.12)  | So it's coming from the user agent style sheet, but it also comes from the document that's           |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=712.62)  | being set.                                                                                           |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=713.62)  | So usually you should have like a language set in the top of your HTML.                              |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=716.72)  | But this can be set in CSS.                                                                          |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=718.92)  | And if you do set it, direction colon left to right or direction colon right to left,                |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=723.28)  | and it changes the direction of text and tables, grids, and more.                                    |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=727.64)  | So it's not just necessarily text direction.                                                         |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=730.08)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=731.08)  | And then with text direction is writing mode, which is something that pairs very nicely              |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=734.86)  | with direction.                                                                                      |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=736.2)   | So writing mode lets you set whether the text is laid out horizontally or vertically, and            |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=741.6)   | which way the blocks would go.                                                                       |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=744.06)  | So the value of horizontal dash TB would be something that goes right to left or left                |

| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=754.8)   | But it would be horizontal, and then the blocks would kind of go from top to bottom.                 |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=759.16)  | The other values are vertical dash RL and vertical dash LR, which stand for vertical                 |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=764.36)  | right left and vertical left right, respectively.                                                    |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=767.58)  | And this also showcases how the writing mode is, whether it's vertical, you still need               |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=773.04)  | to specify if it's going from right to left or left to right.                                        |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=776.44)  | And writing mode is where you set all that.                                                          |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=778.4)   | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=779.4)   | Excellent breakdown.                                                                                 |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=780.4)   | The next property we have here is text align.                                                        |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=782.84)  | And this accepts things like left, right, justify and center.                                        |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=786.48)  | It also takes logical property values like end and start.                                            |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=790.0)   | It's kind of just text align.                                                                        |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=791.0)   | That one's pretty common.                                                                            |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=792.0)   | You'll find this one in your text editor whenever you're moving paragraphs around.                   |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=794.84)  | And that's the CSS property you want.                                                                |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=796.72)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=797.72)  | So we also have text orientation, which sets the orientation and vertical writing modes.             |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=802.4)   | And you can set this to mixed, upright or sideways.                                                  |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=806.12)  | Mixed rotates each of the characters of horizontal scripts 90 degrees clockwise.                     |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=811.84)  | So one use case for this would be to have a block language like English, which isn't                 |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=817.52)  | usually vertical, but maybe you want that to look like it's turned sideways.                         |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=822.36)  | So you could set the text orientation to mixed and it would rotate all those letters.                |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=827.6)   | This is something I've seen in like more trendy web designs getting more and more common.            |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=833.08)  | Sideways would rotate the entire line.                                                               |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=834.56)  | That's another value there for the property.                                                         |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=836.88)  | And the upright value makes sure that text is upright when it's in a vertical mode.                  |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=841.32)  | So to visualize this in a language like English, the way that I like to think of it is back          |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=847.36)  | in grade school, we'd make these acrostic poems with our names and we'd write our names              |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=852.32)  | top to bottom by letters like U and then on the next line N and then the next line A.                |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=857.24)  | So this is what upright would do.                                                                    |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=859.44)  | It would maintain that directionality.                                                               |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=862.84)  | And so this is probably going to be more useful for Asian character glyphs.                          |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=867.36)  | But just to give you that visual of what upright does, you would do that and it would kind           |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=871.44)  | of keep the text in that format.                                                                     |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=873.44)  | But I guess you could write text that way.                                                           |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=875.44)  | It's just hard to read.                                                                              |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=876.72)  | Yeah, I think like a common use case is like a tab on the side of a table or something               |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=882.12)  | to highlight three rows or something.                                                                |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=885.0)   | That can be a nice use case, but I like to your example because I've definitely done                 |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=889.12)  | that with my name or played the game house anyway.                                                   |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=893.28)  | You're like house?                                                                                   |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=894.28)  | Oh yeah, I remember.                                                                                 |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=895.28)  | I played other games in childhood.                                                                   |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=896.68)  | We didn't play house, but we had other games.                                                        |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=899.72)  | Next one is text shadow.                                                                             |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=900.96)  | And this takes, I have this one like memorized.                                                      |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=903.46)  | This is X, Y and blur amount and then a color.                                                       |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=907.46)  | And so the X is an offset amount.                                                                    |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=908.88)  | Like how much should this be offset on X?                                                            |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=911.0)   | How much should it be offset on Y?                                                                   |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=912.12)  | They both take lengths.                                                                              |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=913.4)   | The blur amount is also a length and then the last value is a color.                                 |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=917.0)   | So a good example, and this is almost what I always use in terms of text shadow is zero              |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=921.96)  | on the X offset.                                                                                     |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=923.84)  | Y is one pixel offset.                                                                               |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=926.16)  | The blur is two pixels and then I choose a semi-transparent value.                                   |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=930.12)  | So it's like HSL zero, 0%, 0%.                                                                       |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=933.16)  | So it's black and then I use a slash 25% to say it's 25% black.                                      |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=937.16)  | So I get this really hairline slightly blurred text shadow that really will help text pop            |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=942.12)  | off the page.                                                                                        |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=943.12)  | That's a little pro tip from Adam right there.                                                       |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=945.84)  | That's his personal text shadow.                                                                     |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=947.96)  | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=948.96)  | You can also use a comma and pass more than one, which was so hot when the first iPhone              |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=953.08)  | came out for that inset text appearance.                                                             |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=955.64)  | And I would be using a text shadow of Y offset down of one pixel with no blur and then like          |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=962.02)  | a black.                                                                                             |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=963.14)  | And then I do a offset on Y as a second shadow that was white.                                       |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=967.04)  | And so I'd get this top highlight with a bottom shadow and it looked like text was inset in          |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=971.04)  | the page.                                                                                            |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=972.04)  | So just a couple of shadows anyway.                                                                  |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=973.76)  | Wow.                                                                                                 |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=974.76)  | That was so trendy for a while.                                                                      |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=976.04)  | It was so trendy.                                                                                    |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=977.32)  | It also increases legibility if you have something like text on a multicolored image like a gradient |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=984.24)  | because you're ensuring that there's contrast with light and dark on that text.                      |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=988.8)   | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=989.8)   | So next we have text rendering, another property that might help your text be more legible.          |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=995.5)   | The default value is auto that lets the browser decide, but then there's also values of optimized    |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1000.52) | speed, optimized legibility and geometric precision.                                                 |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1003.8)  | So for optimized speed, the browser emphasizes rendering speed over legibility and geometric         |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1009.76) | precision.                                                                                           |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1010.76) | When drawing its text, it's going to do whatever is fastest to render.                               |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1013.46) | Then there's optimized legibility, which emphasizes legibility.                                      |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1016.84) | That's what you're saying is the most important thing over rendering speed and geometric precision.  |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1021.98) | So with this one, it's interesting because some system fonts like Microsoft's Calibri                |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1025.88) | have ligatures and these would be rendered on small fonts when you have optimized legibility         |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1031.56) | set.                                                                                                 |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1032.56) | So a ligature is something like if you have two F's in a row or FI, it would connect the             |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1036.26) | letters and create a new character that combines those.                                              |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1041.24) | And then there's geometric precision, which highlights geometric precision.                          |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1044.52) | And this might be used when you want to make sure that the visual appearance of something,           |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1049.42) | if you're doing things like kerning is the most optimal that it can be, which could make             |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1054.08) | some like really hairline like pixel changes that are noticeable.                                    |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1057.84) | And the reason why you might want to use geometric precision is because when you're doing things     |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1061.48) | like kerning, sometimes you're moving things in a sub pixel manner and you might not have            |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1067.04) | those scale linearly.                                                                                |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1068.84) | So with geometric precision, the browser tries to make like a nice, thin, optimal scaling            |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1075.28) | view to reduce blur.                                                                                 |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1077.38) | So that I know made a big difference maybe six or seven years ago in some browsers, but              |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1083.8)  | I feel like now the browser rendering engines are a little bit better with font rendering.           |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1088.28) | Yep, I agree.                                                                                        |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1089.28) | I haven't had to touch these properties in a long time.                                              |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1092.0)  | The next one we have here is text underline position.                                                |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1094.98) | And this is apparently packed with complexity.                                                       |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1097.68) | I'd never realized it.                                                                               |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1098.82) | So this allows specifying which side of the text the underline is on.                                |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1102.0)  | Right?                                                                                               |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1103.0)  | That's no nothing crazy.                                                                             |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1104.4)  | And for Latin, this is always the bottom.                                                            |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1107.04) | But in other writing modes and document directions, the underline could be somewhere else, right?    |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1111.88) | It could be on the left or the right or the top.                                                     |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1114.2)  | And this lets you control that.                                                                      |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1116.04) | So you could essentially grab the reins and put it somewhere forever and every language              |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1121.5)  | would be on one side.                                                                                |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1122.6)  | Or you can use auto and that will work internationally.                                              |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1125.96) | So you can change the position using under, left, right, or even like a combo of under,              |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1131.96) | left.                                                                                                |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1132.96) | But once I read this spec, I'm like, I'm going to keep this to auto pretty much always unless        |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1137.7)  | I have a good reason to stick an underline somewhere else.                                           |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1140.16) | But kind of cool that that was there.                                                                |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1141.8)  | Yeah, I could see how that could get confusing if you start to move this around into other           |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1145.44) | places.                                                                                              |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1146.44) | But the option is there to make something creative.                                                  |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1149.96) | If you could think of a good demo, throw it at us.                                                   |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1153.84) | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1154.84) | Next, we have font styles and some more advanced stuff that you can do with variable fonts.          |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1158.8)  | And this is such a deep section.                                                                     |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1161.46) | So we are actually going to do a show probably just about some of these font variants and            |
| [19:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1166.08) | feature settings and alternates that you can set with variable typography.                           |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1170.08) | But an important font property that you've likely also seen before is just font.                     |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1175.32) | And font is something that is a shorthand that lets you set all of these base font properties.       |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1181.0)  | So the order of font is font style, font variant, font weight, font stretch.                         |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1187.68) | I don't know if we talked about that yet that lets you stretch a typeface horizontally.              |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1192.44) | There's font size, line height, and font family.                                                     |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1196.76) | So you can write all of these in one line with one shorthand using the font property.                |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1202.84) | So how was the ease into some of the more advanced variable font stuff?                              |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1208.24) | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1209.24) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1210.24) | Next is font variant.                                                                                |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1212.04) | So just to clear up some of the words here.                                                          |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1213.68) | So like typeface is the name of the font family as a whole.                                          |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1218.3)  | And then a font is one of the members of the family.                                                 |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1221.4)  | Anyway, so when you're using a word like font variant, this is trying to specifically say            |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1227.0)  | which one of those eight or which one of those 12 in that typeface do you want.                      |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1232.1)  | So anyway, some of the options here are small caps, slashed zero, tabular nums, no ligatures,        |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1237.96) | and they are modifying the font that is being used.                                                  |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1241.88) | And it's kind of cool how you can change these things into small caps.                               |
| [20:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1245.4)  | There's also like petite caps, which match the x height.                                             |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1248.2)  | But yeah, if the font has these options in there.                                                    |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1250.56) | This is a way for you to opt in or out of things like ligatures, slash zeros, etc.                   |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1256.24) | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1257.24) | There's also font kerning.                                                                           |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1258.88) | And kerning defines how letters are spaced in the font.                                              |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1261.8)  | So the three values for font kerning are auto, normal, and none.                                     |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1265.32) | With auto, the browser determines whether font kerning should be used or not.                        |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1269.2)  | Normal uses the font's own kerning information.                                                      |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1272.16) | And then none disables kerning information.                                                          |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1274.4)  | When I want to get a kerning effect, I will usually use letter spacing.                              |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1277.72) | But if there is conflicting information with the font, or you don't like how it's kerning,           |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1282.96) | you could set that to none and then do your own with letter spacing.                                 |
| [21:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1286.56) | Or you might want to be adjusting these values for some other specific typeface visual use           |
| [21:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1292.04) | case.                                                                                                |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1293.04) | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1294.04) | And yeah, this is just...                                                                            |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1295.04) | Fonts are like little apps.                                                                          |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1296.66) | Like you load them in, they have tons of stuff that's built in and all these settings and            |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1300.88) | levers and...                                                                                        |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1302.12) | The thing is like fonts are totally plugins or APIs.                                                 |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1306.08) | You can download them.                                                                               |
| [21:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1307.32) | Like think of it as like a node module.                                                              |
| [21:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1309.1)  | You've downloaded it.                                                                                |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1310.1)  | Now you have an entire set of options that you can use with the typeface.                            |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1314.48) | And you have to determine what you're using and how you want to set your base options.               |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1318.6)  | It's totally like an entire program inside of a file.                                                |
| [22:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1322.64) | And you can set those options in CSS.                                                                |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1324.64) | Yo, it's a bundle and you can tree shake it.                                                         |
| [22:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1328.6)  | Like Jake and Surma have taken their huge fonts and trimmed off all the stuff that isn't             |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1334.68) | in their app and shipped a tree shaking font before.                                                 |
| [22:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1337.76) | So I mean, this stuff is really intense.                                                             |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1340.84) | There's so much you can do.                                                                          |
| [22:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1342.08) | Yeah, you can like specify that you only want to use the ampersand from this font and then           |
| [22:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1347.08) | use it in another typeface and have everything be really performant and just clean.                  |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1354.64) | And there's a lot that we kind of have to do manually to get there.                                  |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1357.2)  | Yeah, tons.                                                                                          |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1358.2)  | And that's kind of what's fun about all variable fonts is hopefully you're shipping one font         |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1361.2)  | that has 100 possibilities as opposed to downloading eight fonts that have eight possibilities.      |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1367.12) | Anyway, we're getting a little sidetracked, but it's just so fun.                                    |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1372.36) | The font, should I move on?                                                                          |
| [22:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1373.36) | I think so.                                                                                          |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1374.36) | Yeah, the font feature settings.                                                                     |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1375.6)  | And so these are like open type feature tags.                                                        |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1378.32) | These are a way for you to pass in parameters, almost like functions into the font.                  |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1382.08) | And this takes strings like LIGA for ligatures, TNUM for tabular numbers, SMCP and other things.     |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1390.32) | So if you know a lot about your font, you can tap into these by passing these tags as                |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1394.28) | like a low level feature access to turn these on or off.                                             |
| [23:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1398.88) | So kind of cool.                                                                                     |
| [23:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1399.88) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1400.88) | And then we have font variant alternates, which control the usage of alternate glyphs                |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1405.38) | in a typeface.                                                                                       |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1406.76) | So I feel like this is where we could really just do an entire show on these because with            |
| [23:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1411.38) | variable typography, we get a whole new set of font variants and what we can apply at                |
| [23:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1416.82) | various levels on a scale.                                                                           |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1419.08) | And some of these default variant values include stylistic, style set, character variant, swash,     |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1425.56) | ornament or annotation.                                                                              |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1428.24) | And with those, with something like stylistic, you can set custom values that exist in the           |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1432.32) | variable font and then have those be applied through some of these functions.                        |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1439.98) | Something like swash, you could also set in the at font feature values, and then you would           |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1445.5)  | be setting that up to use it.                                                                        |
| [24:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1447.76) | So you would be able to get swashed characters and a swash character is something like elongating    |
| [24:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1454.16) | like the Q's tail or a Y as it swoops underneath the text itself.                                    |
| [24:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1462.16) | There's just one of so many options.                                                                 |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1463.88) | There's also ornaments.                                                                              |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1465.4)  | You can decorate text elements you can get with like the dingbats font and other decorative          |
| [24:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1469.98) | fonts.                                                                                               |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1471.24) | You can define custom values here.                                                                   |
| [24:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1473.12) | There's just so much you can do with various axes in variable typography options.                    |
| [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1480.16) | It's like a whole world.                                                                             |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1481.96) | And yeah, I'm excited to talk about that more in the future.                                         |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1484.92) | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                       |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1486.2)  | It's the demos are just incredible.                                                                  |
| [24:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1488.48) | They just keep giving to it's like, yeah, they're little apps and the designers of these             |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1492.8)  | apps get to bake in so much whimsical.                                                               |
| [24:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1496.12) | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                    |
| [24:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1497.4)  | They're so whimsical right now.                                                                      |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1499.6)  | What is one area of web development that I feel like is hilarious and whimsical and also             |
| [25:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1504.1)  | super technical at the same time?                                                                    |
| [25:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1505.92) | Like some of the demos are like little poops with the top hat and you could set like the             |
| [25:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1510.2)  | placement of the top hat with an axis on the variable font.                                          |
| [25:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1514.76) | Yeah, and yeah, DevTools is right there giving you this live interaction with the font.              |
| [25:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1519.84) | Anyway, it's so cool.                                                                                |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1520.84) | Okay, let's talk about font variant caps, which we sort of tapped into earlier.                      |
| [25:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1525.44) | But this accepts values like normal small caps, all small caps, petite caps, all petite              |
| [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1530.76) | caps, etc.                                                                                           |
| [25:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1531.76) | Anyway, it just lets you modify the variant there.                                                   |
| [25:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1535.08) | Then there's font variant East Asian.                                                                |
| [25:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1536.94) | And this is just like font variant alternates, but it specifically controls the use of alternate     |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1541.76) | glyphs for East Asian scripts like Japanese and Chinese.                                             |
| [25:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1545.56) | And this gives more robust control over the actual glyphs used.                                      |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1548.72) | There's a lot more meaning in those glyphs than something like using a ligature.                     |
| [25:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1552.4)  | So there's an entire set font variant East Asian for this.                                           |
| [25:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1556.48) | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [25:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1557.48) | Next one is font variant ligatures.                                                                  |
| [25:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1559.28) | And so we tapped on this one earlier with font variant, but this lets you turn them                  |
| [26:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1563.52) | on or off.                                                                                           |
| [26:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1564.52) | Essentially, you can specify normal common ligatures or no common ligatures as your values.          |
| [26:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1569.32) | Love ligatures.                                                                                      |
| [26:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1570.32) | I love them.                                                                                         |
| [26:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1571.32) | Yeah, I'm a big fan of ligatures.                                                                    |
| [26:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1572.32) | I remember the first time I was able to use a ligature in the browser.                               |
| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1575.36) | I was just like blown away by it.                                                                    |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1578.76) | Next is font variant numeric, and this controls the usage of alternate glyphs for numbers,           |
| [26:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1583.2)  | fractions, and ordinal markers.                                                                      |
| [26:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1585.64) | So you can set this to things like slash zero or old style numbers with old style dash nums,         |
| [26:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1591.76) | proportional nums, tabular nums, diagonal fractions, stacked fractions.                              |
| [26:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1597.72) | And you can combine these two.                                                                       |
| [26:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1599.78) | So you can do things like font variant numeric, and then the property values there would be          |
| [26:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1605.2)  | old style nums, space diagonal fractions.                                                            |
| [26:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1608.74) | So you can combine them and you could see what that looks like.                                      |
| [26:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1613.44) | This of course is only available if the font that you're using has these options available.          |
| [26:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1618.28) | So not every font will work with all of these styles, with all of these font variant numeric.        |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1625.18) | Same thing for alternates and all of these options.                                                  |
| [27:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1628.34) | The typeface has to provide it.                                                                      |
| [27:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1629.96) | They're like requests.                                                                               |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1631.88) | And font variant numeric, the tabular nums, that is such a good design choice if you're              |
| [27:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1636.34) | showing numbers, especially if the numbers change.                                                   |
| [27:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1639.2)  | Like if you have the number 1000 and then it goes to 1001, if it wasn't tabular nums,                |
| [27:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1645.24) | the width of the span or whatever that you would shift, and if you use tabular nums,                 |
| [27:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1649.6)  | it wouldn't.                                                                                         |
| [27:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1650.6)  | And so it allows you to increment and decrement numbers without any layout shift.                    |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1654.04) | Oh, I suppose using font variant numeric tabular nums is a CLS.                                      |
| [27:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1659.48) | It's a commutative layout shift fix.                                                                 |
| [27:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1661.88) | So anyway, if you're looking for ways to improve your CLS, you should just use font variant          |
| [27:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1667.48) | numeric tabular nums.                                                                                |
| [27:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1669.36) | And the best part is that previously to do that, you would have to use a plugin that                 |
| [27:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1674.32) | broke out every single character of the text that you were inputting and set the width               |
| [28:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1680.48) | of every single like span tag that that would create and adjust that way.                            |
| [28:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1687.0)  | That's no longer needed.                                                                             |
| [28:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1688.0)  | Oh, good.                                                                                            |
| [28:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1689.0)  | CSS, you're growing up.                                                                              |
| [28:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1690.0)  | Or use a monospace font.                                                                             |
| [28:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1691.0)  | Yeah, use monospace, which is like another tip there.                                                |
| [28:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1693.48) | But anyway, yes, great, great one.                                                                   |
| [28:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1695.32) | Font variant numeric, use that all the time.                                                         |
| [28:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1697.66) | The next one is font variant position.                                                               |
| [28:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1699.4)  | And this is essentially you can assign something to be a superscript or a subscript, but it's        |
| [28:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1704.76) | only in Firefox.                                                                                     |
| [28:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1705.76) | So yeah, another one with not super great browser support is font size adjust.                       |
| [28:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1710.92) | This is available behind a flag in all the modern browsers.                                          |
| [28:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1713.6)  | But what this allows you to do is set the size of lowercase letters relative to the                  |
| [28:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1719.4)  | current font size.                                                                                   |
| [28:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1720.62) | So you can do things like manually adjusted small caps, if you combine that with the text            |
| [28:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1725.18) | transform or just play with scale.                                                                   |
| [28:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZnB2eIM4MRn3RR7rbWjf3?&t=1727.2)  | I think that's a really interesting font option.                                                     |
