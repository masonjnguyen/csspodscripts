| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=16.84)   | Today we're talking about focus.                                                                     |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=19.64)   | No, the topic of focus itself is not a specific CSS property, though it is a pseudo-state.           |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=26.48)   | Focus is something that we regularly deal with when writing styles.                                  |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=30.4)    | When it comes to focus styling, something I like to say is where there is a hover, there             |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=34.56)   | is an equal and opposite focus.                                                                      |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=37.28)   | Focus is also very tied to markup and attributes like tabindex, so we will be discussing all         |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=42.48)   | of those things in this episode.                                                                     |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=44.64)   | After all, CSS doesn't live in a bubble.                                                             |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=47.28)   | Let's dive in first to what kind of things are focusable.                                            |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=50.08)   | That seems like a reasonable place to start.                                                         |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=52.0)    | The first one here is anchor tags, and it's anchor tags specifically with an href attribute.         |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=57.88)   | They must go somewhere in order to be tab focusable.                                                 |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=61.04)   | I think that's really important as a condition on that focus area.                                   |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=64.36)   | I also want to mention a little tip here because that focus ring, when it shows up on that           |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=68.36)   | link, it can appear very shrink wrapped.                                                             |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=70.24)   | It can kind of cramp the text a little bit.                                                          |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=72.64)   | If you give your link some padding, often I do block padding like on the top and the                 |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=76.36)   | bottom for Latin, you can get a better tap experience on the link and your focus ring                |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=81.16)   | won't look like it's cramping the link so much.                                                      |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=83.36)   | So win-win, links are focusable by default and pad them a little bit.                                |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=87.24)   | What else is focusable, Yuna?                                                                        |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=88.48)   | Yeah, that's a nice tip.                                                                             |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=90.12)   | The next thing that's focusable by default are form controls.                                        |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=93.6)    | This is any input type, whether it's a text field, an input type equals text even, or                |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=98.16)   | check boxes or range sliders, select drop downs, file pickers, any type of input.                    |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=104.56)  | Of course, buttons, which you would also see in a form, these signify an action.                     |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=110.5)   | Once the button is disabled or if any of these input types are disabled, they are focusable          |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=115.08)  | by default.                                                                                          |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=116.4)   | So that is something that you don't have to apply additional controls to.                            |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=121.48)  | You get the accessibility and the focus by default for all the form controls.                        |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=125.44)  | Freebies, got to love freebies.                                                                      |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=127.44)  | And then the last one here for making things focusable, you can make something focusable             |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=131.36)  | by putting a tab index on it.                                                                        |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=132.88)  | This is like the developer designer way of orchestrating and including custom controls               |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=137.44)  | into the focus flow of the page.                                                                     |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=139.44)  | Okay, so we have these three different types of ways to become focusable or focusable items.         |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=145.88)  | And the property that we're putting on these to get that is tab index, or tab index is               |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=150.48)  | a way for us to kind of control the orchestration here.                                              |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=153.04)  | And it can accept a number and it can be a negative number or a positive number.                     |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=156.96)  | And let's start with tab index zero.                                                                 |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=160.2)   | And what does that mean on an element?                                                               |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=162.12)  | So if I have tab index zero, we're saying focus after everything that has a positive                 |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=167.36)  | number.                                                                                              |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=168.36)  | Anything that is one plus will get focused first, but tab index zero is the first place              |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=173.8)   | to go when you're done with the positive integers.                                                   |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=177.0)   | And if there's multiple items with the same tab index of zero, it will then just be DOM              |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=181.04)  | order.                                                                                               |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=182.04)  | So it'll go through the order that way.                                                              |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=183.04)  | And that's what tab index zero means.                                                                |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=184.84)  | Yeah, so next we have tab index of negative one.                                                     |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=188.3)   | And you might be wondering why would you have a negative number here?                                |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=190.76)  | Well tab index of negative one is used to access focus through scripting.                            |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=195.68)  | So this allows us to create programmatic focus that we can then access through JavaScript.           |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=200.64)  | So these elements are removed from the basic DOM focus order, unlike elements with a tab             |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=205.52)  | index of zero or one or any other number that's positive.                                            |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=209.86)  | But we can still access them through scripting.                                                      |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=212.8)   | And this is something that we actually see pretty commonly.                                          |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=215.32)  | We see this a lot when you are creating customized elements, whether that's something like a         |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=218.82)  | tool tip or a custom dropdown menu, tab index of negative one is super useful.                       |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=223.72)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=224.72)  | I agree.                                                                                             |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=225.72)  | We also have tab index of one plus.                                                                  |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=228.12)  | So this is like if you have tab index one, two, three, four, five, or any sort of positive           |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=231.76)  | integer, the tab focus will go in ascending order through these elements.                            |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=236.5)   | So it's a great way to orchestrate if you want to explicitly say this goes to this goes              |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=241.04)  | to that.                                                                                             |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=242.04)  | But there is a tip that comes from most accessibility experts that say try to avoid being in control |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=247.24)  | of this flow.                                                                                        |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=248.24)  | Try to keep it as close to the DOM order flow as possible.                                           |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=251.36)  | And my advice is along the same lines, because in a responsive environment, the DOM flow             |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=255.84)  | is going to be more reliable than something you're trying to orchestrate at different                |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=258.96)  | media queries.                                                                                       |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=260.0)   | So anyway, it can get sort of difficult.                                                             |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=262.46)  | And we briefly covered, though, what happens if elements have the same tab index.                    |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=266.64)  | But what was it again, Eunette?                                                                      |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=268.2)   | Well, I think that the best advice to sort of give about tab index is that you don't                 |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=272.24)  | want to be applying multiple tab indexes, especially positive values.                                |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=277.18)  | If you do need to create focus into an element that doesn't typically have focus, like a             |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=281.6)   | link, or a form element, you can give it a tab index of zero and then it'll align in                 |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=287.56)  | the DOMs natural tabbing order.                                                                      |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=289.76)  | So you want to mostly be using that natural tabbing order.                                           |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=293.34)  | If you do have a value that's greater than one or one and nothing else has a one value               |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=298.36)  | on it, that's going to be tabbed into before anything else.                                          |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=302.12)  | So this can be used if you have a very specific workflow for the tab navigation of your website.     |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=309.1)   | But just be careful when you are starting to change up how things work for the keyboard              |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=314.32)  | navigation in your application.                                                                      |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=316.12)  | Yep, they're cool tricks.                                                                            |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=318.32)  | Use them sparingly.                                                                                  |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=319.32)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=320.32)  | Okay, so we have tab index because today's episode is about focus.                                   |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=323.6)   | And this is how you can sort of orchestrate focus.                                                   |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=326.12)  | But let's talk more about the pseudo class itself of focus.                                          |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=329.64)  | Like how can I style it?                                                                             |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=331.24)  | Are there different kinds and stuff like that?                                                       |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=333.24)  | And you know, I see here you have colon focus.                                                       |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=336.58)  | Tell us about that one.                                                                              |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=337.58)  | Yes, I think that when most people think focus in CSS, that's what they think of colon focus,        |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=341.54)  | the pseudo class.                                                                                    |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=343.0)   | And as I mentioned earlier, where there's a hover state, there should also be a focus                |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=346.28)  | state.                                                                                               |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=347.28)  | So it's typically a really good idea to do an audit of your application to check out                 |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=350.84)  | if you have any hover interactions, and to add a focus state.                                        |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=355.4)   | Just you know, if you have colon hover, add a comma colon focus, and make sure you have              |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=358.88)  | some sort of keyboard interaction that's equivalent to a mouse interaction to make sure that no      |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=362.8)   | matter how someone is accessing your site, they can get that good experience.                        |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=367.2)   | Focus is something that you can apply to elements, you can also style things like pseudo elements    |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=372.16)  | on elements with focus.                                                                              |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=373.76)  | And the way that you want to do that is like div colon focus first, like div colon focus,            |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=378.44)  | and then double colon before that's how you style the before pseudo element on a base                |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=383.56)  | element that has a focus pseudo class with the focus activated.                                      |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=387.72)  | So I guess order is important here.                                                                  |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=389.8)   | Just remember that you have the colon first before the double colon for the pseudo element.          |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=393.6)   | But yeah, focus, very common interaction pattern.                                                    |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=396.94)  | And just make sure that you are applying it whenever you have something like hover.                  |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=400.52)  | Strong agree.                                                                                        |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=401.52)  | In fact, if there's one tip that you leave this episode with, it is that one right there.            |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=405.16)  | If you're putting a hover effect, consider focus.                                                    |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=408.04)  | And I just learned that focus has to come before so a pseudo class must come before                  |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=412.08)  | a pseudo element.                                                                                    |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=413.08)  | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=414.08)  | I mean, it makes sense because the pseudo element probably doesn't have the pseudo class.            |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=417.18)  | So order is important there.                                                                         |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=419.0)   | And if you're wondering what a pseudo class and a pseudo element are, we have episodes               |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=422.74)  | on these.                                                                                            |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=423.74)  | And so yeah, pseudo class is when you're targeting an element that you don't control.                |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=427.68)  | It's like browser owned.                                                                             |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=428.94)  | So that's what this focus ring is.                                                                   |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=430.46)  | It's like this little visual floaty thing that appears over an element and the way that              |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=435.12)  | you interact with it in CSS is through this pseudo class.                                            |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=438.34)  | And so yeah, you covered focus.                                                                      |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=440.56)  | Strong definition there.                                                                             |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=442.28)  | We also have focus visible here.                                                                     |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=444.9)   | And so this is kind of CSS asking the question of the browser, should I give focus?                  |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=451.0)   | It's kind of like a question, should I indicate focus here?                                          |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=454.12)  | And you're letting the browser tell you, which is kind of the best part.                             |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=456.52)  | The browser will use heuristics, just this awesome word, just means magic, to determine              |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=461.4)   | whether or not it's a good idea.                                                                     |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=463.4)   | Because you might not always want a focus ring on your interactive elements.                         |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=467.88)  | It turns out there's times where focus can be a little too ambitious.                                |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=473.2)   | So like if you're on a desktop and you click a button, different browsers treat that button          |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=477.9)   | as focused or not.                                                                                   |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=479.36)  | This is part of their own heuristics.                                                                |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=481.54)  | So if a button is keyboard focused and then clicked with the space bar or even just keyboard         |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=487.0)   | focused with the tab key, that is guaranteed you want to see a focus ring.                           |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=490.8)   | But if someone just clicks it with a mouse, they might not want the focus ring.                      |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=494.5)   | And so you have like Safari versus Chromium here.                                                    |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=496.92)  | Safari does not put focus on to clicked buttons anymore.                                             |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=499.92)  | They used to, but they fixed it.                                                                     |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=501.5)   | Or fixed it depends on what your definition of what you want is.                                     |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=504.84)  | Focus visible though is your way of opting into this Boolean value that's controlled                 |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=509.06)  | by the browser and choosing to show focus ring or just to change the focus styles if                 |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=513.66)  | that's showing.                                                                                      |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=514.66)  | So anyway, right now the support for focus visible is pretty much Firefox only.                      |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=519.48)  | And then Safari is implementing clicked buttons not focusing and Chromium does focus clicked         |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=525.12)  | buttons.                                                                                             |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=526.12)  | So there's basically a little bit of incompatibility in the web here around focus and indicating     |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=531.76)  | focus for buttons.                                                                                   |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=533.52)  | And we hope to see some resolution in that over the next year or so as focus visible                 |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=538.1)   | becomes implemented and browsers and their heuristics start to align on when to show                 |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=542.84)  | focus and when not.                                                                                  |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=544.28)  | I don't know if that was interesting to you, but it's just like this edge of the internet            |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=548.08)  | that's kind of fun.                                                                                  |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=549.08)  | So I don't know.                                                                                     |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=550.08)  | Yeah, I mean, that's definitely been me before, so it's good to know.                                |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=553.1)   | And also with some of these new form styles on Chromium, we do see that focus ring on                |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=558.68)  | click and it is different than what it looked like before.                                           |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=561.2)   | So be mindful of that.                                                                               |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=562.4)   | If you are doing focus visible and you are adjusting focus ring styles, they will look               |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=567.7)   | different on different browsers.                                                                     |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=568.88)  | So make sure that you're doing your testing.                                                         |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=570.52)  | And even with like the new form elements, they might look different than what you were               |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=572.92)  | expecting before.                                                                                    |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=574.22)  | So check those things out.                                                                           |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=576.14)  | Another important focus aspect property, Pseudo class, is that the name?                             |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=581.88)  | Pseudo class is focus within and this is used when containing focus.                                 |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=586.4)   | So focus within is supported in all modern browsers, but not IE 11.                                  |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=591.16)  | So again, if you do have a browser matrix that supports older browsers, be sure that                 |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=594.64)  | you're testing this.                                                                                 |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=595.84)  | But with focus within, what this essentially allows us to do is apply a focus style to               |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=601.36)  | a parent when its children have focus.                                                               |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=604.68)  | Now why would you need this?                                                                         |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=606.12)  | Let me illustrate an example.                                                                        |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=607.88)  | So say you have a tool tip and that tool tip is going to pop up on a focus of a button               |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=615.76)  | that makes it appear.                                                                                |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=617.62)  | So cool, in the DOM order, you have the button, then you have the tool tip, and then inside          |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=621.76)  | the tool tip, you have some additional content.                                                      |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=623.64)  | So you have a call to action button inside that tool tip.                                            |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=626.72)  | When you're focused on the button, you can apply a adjacent sibling selector to create               |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=632.84)  | a focus state for the adjacent sibling, which is the tool tip.                                       |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=637.92)  | Now when you're focused on the tool tip, you can give it a tab index of zero so you can              |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=641.68)  | focus into that tool tip.                                                                            |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=643.48)  | That's visually appearing, you maybe give it like a display block or some kind of opacity            |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=647.32)  | to make it appear.                                                                                   |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=648.92)  | Now when you focus into the call to action inside of the tool tip, you will lose focus               |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=654.74)  | on the tool tip itself.                                                                              |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=656.4)   | And that's because you can't style parent selectors.                                                 |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=659.38)  | And because you're not focusing on the parent, you're focusing on a child inside of the              |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=662.8)   | parent.                                                                                              |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=663.8)   | So if you were relying on CSS to be styling something by using focus, this is not a reliable         |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=668.84)  | mechanism.                                                                                           |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=669.84)  | But with focus within, where you have that focus style applied to the parent, you can                |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=673.44)  | basically set the same style when you're focusing within that parent.                                |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=677.52)  | So if you do have it visible or you have it outlined or some kind of style there with                |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=682.48)  | a focus state, you can set that same state when you are focusing within the parent, focus            |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=686.96)  | within.                                                                                              |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=687.96)  | It's pretty great.                                                                                   |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=689.32)  | And I've used this a few times.                                                                      |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=691.04)  | So use it if you need it.                                                                            |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=692.64)  | Definitely agree.                                                                                    |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=693.64)  | Focus within is amazing.                                                                             |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=694.64)  | And your definition there, it totally, I mean, you're going to cover roving focus here in            |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=697.72)  | a second and it feels like focus within is super valuable in like enabling roving focus              |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=703.44)  | without JavaScript.                                                                                  |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=704.44)  | Because just like you described, like you might focus one thing and then you want to                 |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=707.08)  | focus on something inside of there and you lose focus on the parent when you navigate                |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=711.16)  | your focus, right?                                                                                   |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=712.76)  | And so JavaScript might've been used to manage that before.                                          |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=715.48)  | And now you've got these Booleans to manage and events to manage and you don't have to               |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=719.8)   | do that with focus within.                                                                           |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=721.44)  | It's just this subtle freebie.                                                                       |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=723.32)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=724.32)  | And since you brought up roving focus, just to illustrate the difference here with this              |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=727.48)  | focus within, you don't have a control over that interactive experience.                             |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=731.4)   | You are still focusing through the DOM order as the tab index or natural tab order would             |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=736.56)  | have you focusing.                                                                                   |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=738.4)   | So unlike roving focus, which gives you more controls over if you were to tab in and then            |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=743.68)  | tab out, you'd be in a different experience.                                                         |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=745.68)  | There are different controls for that, but it is sort of like adjusting inside of an                 |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=750.44)  | experience I guess for your DOM.                                                                     |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=753.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=754.16)  | No, yeah.                                                                                            |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=755.16)  | You cleared it up for me.                                                                            |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=756.16)  | Okay, cool.                                                                                          |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=757.16)  | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=758.16)  | Well now I'm excited for roving focus.                                                               |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=759.16)  | So I'll have to let me get through auto focus.                                                       |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=760.5)   | There's an attribute called auto focus.                                                              |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=762.64)  | You can put it on an element and what that will do is when the page loads, it will put               |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=766.78)  | focus into that element.                                                                             |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=768.4)   | I personally feel this one is okay for things like primary search elements that are inside           |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=773.36)  | your main nav.                                                                                       |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=774.74)  | But I do agree there are like warnings that say be careful with this because you can sort            |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=778.56)  | of hijack focus.                                                                                     |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=779.72)  | So and I think that's valid.                                                                         |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=781.12)  | I think it can make for a nice UX touch though when you see a blinking cursor in like a search       |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=784.88)  | input say for like an e-commerce store.                                                              |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=787.2)   | But I know it's on you.                                                                              |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=788.2)   | Give it some testing.                                                                                |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=789.2)   | People who are blind or have low vision might be disoriented when focus is moving around             |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=792.86)  | without their permission.                                                                            |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=794.24)  | Just be mindful of that.                                                                             |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=795.52)  | Also auto focus can be problematic for people with motor control disabilities as it might            |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=799.3)   | create extra work for them to navigate out of that auto focused area.                                |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=803.24)  | So do some testing.                                                                                  |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=804.3)   | It might be helpful.                                                                                 |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=805.3)   | It might be disruptive.                                                                              |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=806.64)  | Tip for me is use the attribute and avoid setting this lazy.                                         |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=810.48)  | So don't do this after page load.                                                                    |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=812.32)  | You might really cause some shifting of focus around in that way.                                    |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=815.96)  | Yeah, that's a tricky one for sure.                                                                  |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=818.36)  | So we did mention roving focus earlier and this is an accessibility concept or pattern               |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=825.24)  | for interactive elements.                                                                            |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=826.24)  | And I think that the best way to explain this is to start with an example.                           |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=830.4)   | So picture a drop down menu like a select or even a group of radio buttons as you navigate           |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=836.16)  | through the list of options, which you could do via keyboard and arrow keys.                         |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=841.44)  | The element which is focused within that parent changes.                                             |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=845.26)  | But if you are tabbing into that drop down, the next time you hit tab, you should be tabbing         |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=850.52)  | out of the drop down.                                                                                |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=851.52)  | So there's a different set of experiences for navigating the page and navigating within              |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=856.88)  | that element.                                                                                        |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=857.88)  | So it's like this contextual interactive experience.                                                 |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=860.98)  | So this idea of roving tab index or roving focus is an example of when you would use                 |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=866.56)  | JavaScript to change all the tab indices of the non-focused items to negative one, which             |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=871.64)  | is a programmatic focus, but not in the flow.                                                        |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=874.24)  | So you would adjust the focus item to have a tab index of one.                                       |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=878.08)  | And this allows you to use the arrow keys.                                                           |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=881.06)  | So as you hit the down arrow and you're going through these items and you hit the last item,         |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=885.5)   | if you hit down again, it'll pop back up to the top of the list.                                     |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=888.68)  | So you're not just stuck there.                                                                      |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=890.52)  | And so this gives accessibility context.                                                             |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=892.92)  | It traps focus within an element and basically signals that you're in an interactive experience.     |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=898.18)  | So just be aware that if you're designing an interactive component, like you're recreating           |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=902.56)  | a select from a web component or you're recreating a calendar component, you'll likely want to       |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=908.64)  | add some roving focus patterns in that component.                                                    |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=912.52)  | And since we're already talking about JavaScript land here, remember that when you add focus         |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=917.08)  | programmatically, it's also important to create a blur event tied to a keystroke like escape.        |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=922.88)  | So your users can leave the interactive element experience if they're within it using the            |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=927.5)   | keyboard as well.                                                                                    |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=928.88)  | Rad.                                                                                                 |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=929.88)  | Nailed it.                                                                                           |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=930.88)  | Roving focus.                                                                                        |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=931.88)  | It's amazing.                                                                                        |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=932.88)  | It can really bring some nice UX to your page.                                                       |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=934.6)   | Superb breakdown.                                                                                    |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=935.6)   | There was a part in there.                                                                           |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=936.6)   | I just felt like you nailed it.                                                                      |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=938.4)   | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                    |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=939.4)   | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=940.4)   | So styling.                                                                                          |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=941.4)   | How do we change the style of our focus?                                                             |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=942.86)  | And the way that we can do that primarily is with an outline.                                        |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=946.72)  | And the outline is nice because it's not changing the geometry of the element that's being focused.  |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=951.08)  | So you're not causing any shifting of things around there.                                           |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=953.74)  | But it can be sort of frustrating because it maybe feels limited.                                    |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=956.98)  | But you know, it is what it is.                                                                      |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=958.6)   | There's also differentiators between different browsers to where Safari now has rounded corners      |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=963.56)  | on their focus ring.                                                                                 |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=965.16)  | And it looks really nice.                                                                            |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=966.52)  | There's also different browsers might transition from one focus ring to another.                     |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=970.24)  | So there's kind of cool tricks that can guide the user as they go through.                           |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=973.56)  | But ultimately, the outline CSS property is how you can contribute to the styling of this            |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=978.52)  | focus.                                                                                               |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=979.52)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=980.52)  | And you can also use border to create shapes for your focus ring.                                    |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=983.8)   | The nice thing about border is that it does follow the shape of the parent and its border            |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=987.52)  | radius unlike outline, which in some browsers is a box shape.                                        |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=992.28)  | It's always going to be a box div in that box model.                                                 |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=996.28)  | Not div, a box.                                                                                      |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=997.28)  | It's just a box.                                                                                     |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=998.28)  | I don't know why I keep saying box.                                                                  |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=999.28)  | But border is going to follow the clip, which would be inclusive of border radius.                   |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1004.2)  | There's a lot of other ways to style things.                                                         |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1006.64) | Border just keep in mind will create a geometric shift or a relay out because it's adding space      |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1012.52) | like a photo frame.                                                                                  |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1014.24) | But if you set it to inset, it would prevent that geometric shifting.                                |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1017.58) | You can also use things like a drop shadow or a box shadow to sort of create a border                |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1023.34) | like effect.                                                                                         |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1024.52) | You can use the filters to create hover style effects.                                               |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1028.08) | I think that using filters for focus and hover states are a great opportunity to include             |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1033.84) | those in your code base, not have to have a lot of additional overhead.                              |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1037.58) | Even just shifting the hue is something you can do with a filter.                                    |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1041.08) | I like using filters and they're supported in all modern browsers.                                   |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1044.04) | So hey, use them.                                                                                    |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1045.84) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1046.84) | I've even done it where something can be focused and maybe I'm just inspired by DVD menus.           |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1052.64) | And put this behind prefers reduced motion, but you can have a button that's floating                |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1056.88) | so it's focused and you can animate in that state and it's sort of like pending or maybe             |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1060.64) | you have a ring around it to sort of animated like on the Nintendo switch when you have              |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1064.28) | a video game selected.                                                                               |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1065.28) | Yeah, that's nice.                                                                                   |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4tNfpDEZg8iAkGHUlrLRsc?&t=1066.36) | So yes, the opportunities are endless.                                                               |
