| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=17.72)   | Today we're scrolling through scroll timeline, a new experimental and totally awesome CSS          |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=23.36)   | property that lets you declaratively hook into the scroll bar of the page or of an element         |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=28.64)   | within the page to create effects.                                                                 |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=31.28)   | Much like with CSS animations and animation timeline, a scroll timeline lets you attach            |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=36.04)   | visual changes to a scroller, except instead of using time like you would with animations,         |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=41.48)   | with scroll timeline you use scroll state to indicate when a style is applied.                     |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=46.6)    | It is so cool.                                                                                     |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=47.64)   | You're so right.                                                                                   |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=48.64)   | It's like the most exciting CSS I've written all year are these scroll timelines.                  |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=53.16)   | I'm just so stoked on them.                                                                        |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=54.28)   | I've seen some really cool demos of this.                                                          |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=56.28)   | It's so cool.                                                                                      |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=57.28)   | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=58.28)   | So, you gave a good what.                                                                          |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=59.64)   | There's kind of like two main pieces to the concept of a scroll timeline or just scrolling         |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=64.36)   | animations and it's scroll linked and scroll triggered animations.                                 |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=67.92)   | And so what is a scroll linked animation?                                                          |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=70.12)   | This is where scroll progress is directly linked to an animation's progress.                       |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=75.44)   | An unscrolled scroller puts the timeline marker at the start and something that's scrolled         |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=80.48)   | to the end puts the timeline marker at the end.                                                    |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=83.4)    | So then there's scroll triggered animations and scroll triggered essentially says when             |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=87.48)   | I get to a certain point in the scroll trigger an animation to go off.                             |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=90.8)    | So this isn't tied to the scroll position for the entire event loop, just to that trigger          |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=95.04)   | point to start or stop the animation.                                                              |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=97.92)   | And I've actually seen a lot of this in the past with things like waypoints and other              |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=100.92)  | JavaScript libraries that would emulate this sort of like scroll triggered animation.              |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=105.52)  | Also with scroll linked, we used to have to hack it or use JavaScript for this stuff,              |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=109.04)  | but now I can do it with CSS.                                                                      |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=111.4)   | So anyway, with scroll triggered, you get scroll position plus progress and those are              |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=115.2)   | linked to animation's progress.                                                                    |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=116.88)  | Absolutely.                                                                                        |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=117.88)  | It's so hard not to just be so stoked off all these little bullets.                                |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=121.04)  | It's so amazing.                                                                                   |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=122.04)  | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=123.04)  | So like use cases.                                                                                 |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=124.04)  | I think the most essential use case are like if you were to pick this up today and you             |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=126.16)  | want to try it out, this experimental thing, try to make reading completion.                       |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=129.8)   | This is where you'd scroll from the top of an article to the bottom of one and have a              |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=133.38)  | progress bar fill up.                                                                              |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=135.02)  | It's like a few lines of CSS now and it's really cool.                                             |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=138.44)  | You're just like, wow, I just changed the width or I changed the translate X or something.         |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=142.96)  | And as someone scrolled and filled up this bar anyway.                                             |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=145.76)  | So that's a really essential use case is reading completion.                                       |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=149.22)  | But then you can make tab component use cases like I did in Goody challenges where swiping,        |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=154.52)  | tapping or clicking on tabs or scrolling, all of which keep an indicator linked with               |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=159.64)  | that scroll position to an actual button in there.                                                 |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=162.1)   | So it's like this live button has this attachment to the scroll.                                   |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=165.6)   | Anyway, it's just feels so alive.                                                                  |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=166.92)  | There's so much cool orchestration.                                                                |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=168.12)  | You can also recreate the iTunes album cover flow interface that's 3D and touch friendly           |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=172.64)  | and all sorts of cool stuff like that.                                                             |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=174.3)   | And then I think another crucial use case is if you're on Ionic or you're making a native          |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=177.88)  | app and you have a scrolling list and you're scrolling up and down this list and as new            |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=181.76)  | items come in from the bottom, they transition in and as they exit from the top, they transition   |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=186.52)  | out.                                                                                               |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=187.52)  | And it just seems like this native thing that just we could never do in CSS because we'd           |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=191.08)  | be chasing it with JavaScript.                                                                     |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=192.36)  | But now we can and it's right here.                                                                |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=194.52)  | Yeah, those are a lot of great use cases.                                                          |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=196.64)  | There's so many things that you can use scrolling to animations for.                               |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=199.28)  | I like that you mentioned the reading completion because I remember hacking this with a background |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=206.16)  | gradient that was – it went from the left to right and kind of made a triangle and as              |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=211.0)   | you scroll down, it would just reveal more of the gradient.                                        |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=214.2)   | Cool.                                                                                              |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=216.2)   | But yeah, that is a great example of what you could use scroll timeline for.                       |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=220.2)   | There's also positioning in progressive web apps and those tabs.                                   |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=225.72)  | One thing that I really like using this idea of scroll timeline for too is entrance and            |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=230.36)  | exit criteria for marketing pages.                                                                 |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=232.86)  | An example of that is like Apple.                                                                  |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=235.32)  | Apple does this when they launch new products.                                                     |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=237.1)   | They make these really splashy web pages where as you scroll, things kind of pop in or pop         |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=242.98)  | up.                                                                                                |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=243.98)  | Stripe has done this.                                                                              |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=244.98)  | A lot of big websites have kind of used these effects.                                             |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=247.9)   | So I like that we can use this not only for like these marketing pages but also as you             |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=252.56)  | mentioned really practical examples like entrance and exit, really making smooth apps, making      |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=258.68)  | things feel very native.                                                                           |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=259.68)  | Lots of great things you could do with scroll timeline.                                            |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=262.56)  | The best part is this is a declarative approach to it so you don't have to worry about writing     |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=266.74)  | a bunch of JavaScript that's outside of your styles.                                               |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=271.26)  | You can sort of collate that and it's more performant because it is directly reading               |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=277.14)  | from your files.                                                                                   |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=278.56)  | I believe it's GPU accelerated.                                                                    |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=280.4)   | Yes it is.                                                                                         |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=281.4)   | Definitely if you're changing GPU accelerated properties too inside of there.                      |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=285.08)  | Yes, like transform functions, opacity, those are really some of the biggest things that           |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=289.92)  | you could use this for.                                                                            |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=291.6)   | And yeah, it's just an exciting piece of technology.                                               |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=295.88)  | Or you can scroll through app property values like I said a percentage and I go from 0 to          |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=300.52)  | 100% based on a scroll and then I use that custom property somewhere.                              |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=304.52)  | Yeah, that is a great example like creating CSS custom properties and updating the values          |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=310.16)  | of those custom properties based on scroll.                                                        |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=312.48)  | Yeah, it is so cool.                                                                               |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=314.08)  | Okay, so we know what kind of meals we can make with this and they sound delicious and             |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=319.08)  | I want to eat them but I also, I'm an author and I want to make this meal.                         |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=323.96)  | So the ingredients, what does it take to make one of these declaratively?                          |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=327.42)  | Step one is you need some key frames, one or many.                                                 |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=331.12)  | You also need a scrollable area and a scroll timeline with that area as the source.                |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=336.32)  | And then the last glue piece is the animation dash timeline property on the element that           |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=341.06)  | needs to be animated from the key frames needs to specify which timeline it wants to use.          |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=346.4)   | So that's animation dash timeline.                                                                 |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=348.2)   | So TLDR, you got key frames plus new custom timelines and linking them together with animation     |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=353.8)   | timeline are the three ingredients that you need in this tasty scroll timelines do.                |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=359.0)   | Right?                                                                                             |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=360.0)   | Only three ingredients?                                                                            |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=361.0)   | It sounds so simple.                                                                               |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=362.0)   | And yeah, it even is sometimes small enough to fit into a tweet.                                   |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=365.28)  | We can tweet an entire scroll linked effect.                                                       |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=368.36)  | I love it.                                                                                         |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=370.6)   | So briefly we have animation timeline is sort of like the easiest one to talk about.               |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=374.8)   | This is a property that you have on an element.                                                    |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=377.0)   | So it's like animation name, but this is animation dash timeline and it accepts a timeline name    |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=381.88)  | that you created with at scroll timeline.                                                          |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=383.56)  | So we'll get into at scroll timeline soon, but basically just like at key frames, say              |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=387.28)  | poof and then you make some poof key frames inside of there.                                       |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=390.7)   | You could say at scroll timeline poof and then tell it which source you're looking at.             |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=394.88)  | Anyway, we'll get there.                                                                           |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=395.88)  | But the animation timeline is where you specify this element is going to be using this kind        |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=399.98)  | of timeline and you point to it.                                                                   |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=401.84)  | And then as Adam briefly mentioned there, there's at scroll timeline and that you give             |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=405.6)   | it a name just like with a key frames for an animation, you would do like at scroll                |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=410.28)  | timeline and then give that a custom identifier like pop in or poof.                               |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=417.2)   | Poof just poofed into my head.                                                                     |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=418.56)  | I mean, I like poof.                                                                               |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=419.56)  | Poof is good.                                                                                      |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=420.56)  | I need to go make a poof effect now.                                                               |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=422.2)   | All right.                                                                                         |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=423.2)   | So then what's next in this at scroll timeline cool declarative little chunk of code we're         |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=427.68)  | writing.                                                                                           |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=428.68)  | We can specify a source.                                                                           |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=430.12)  | So this is optional.                                                                               |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=431.22)  | The default is body.                                                                               |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=432.28)  | So if you just create a random scroll timeline, it'll watch the body's scroll position and         |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=436.92)  | the scrollable element that you want to trigger the animations, what you pass here is the          |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=441.08)  | source.                                                                                            |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=442.08)  | So if it's not body, you would pass something custom and the way you pass a custom something       |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=445.96)  | is with this new function, a new function called selector.                                         |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=450.44)  | It's selector open parentheses and then you pass an ID only.                                       |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=454.4)   | So it's really an ID selector.                                                                     |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=456.4)   | Cannot do query selector all syntax.                                                               |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=459.68)  | And that's all.                                                                                    |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=460.68)  | So you pass a source.                                                                              |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=461.68)  | You either say I want to watch the body and say no source or you target something by ID            |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=465.8)   | and say watch this scroll position for my timeline.                                                |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=468.92)  | Next we have orientation.                                                                          |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=470.76)  | So orientation by default is the block direction, which is the default scroll direction.           |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=476.6)   | So you could think of the orientation as the orientation of your scroll and therefore your         |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=480.12)  | scroll timeline.                                                                                   |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=481.44)  | So orientation indicates the direction of scrolling which triggers the animation and               |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=484.56)  | drives the progress of your scroll timeline.                                                       |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=487.32)  | And if you wanted to do something like the tab, swipey tabs example that Adam was describing       |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=491.62)  | at the top of the show, you would need to change this to inline.                                   |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=494.84)  | So the values that you can use for orientation are block, which is default.                        |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=499.2)   | You don't have to set it.                                                                          |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=500.2)   | Inline, horizontal, and vertical.                                                                  |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=502.4)   | Awesome.                                                                                           |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=503.4)   | Then we have time range and this one is required.                                                  |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=505.48)  | So so far the properties haven't really been required much, but time range is.                     |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=510.48)  | And this one is, well here we'll get there.                                                        |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=512.32)  | A time range is a duration that allows mapping between a distance scrolled and quantities          |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=517.04)  | specified in time units like one second or a thousand milliseconds.                                |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=520.34)  | So like here's an example.                                                                         |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=521.34)  | If the time range is one second and the animation duration is one second, scrolling a document     |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=526.28)  | completely would do one full completion of the animation.                                          |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=530.24)  | Conversely you can make an animation end before the end of the document or never complete          |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=535.32)  | by the end of the document.                                                                        |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=536.56)  | There's a relationship between time range and duration that you're in control of.                  |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=541.28)  | So I have a warning here though, which is it may not be required in the end.                       |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=545.5)   | So this is a draft and something we mentioned was experimental.                                    |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=548.62)  | There's work to try and remove it because you're probably thought to yourself time and             |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=554.32)  | scrolling that's weird.                                                                            |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=556.32)  | It is kind of weird, right?                                                                        |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=558.12)  | So the proposal here is to allow a keyword of auto, which would mean something like a              |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=564.28)  | hundred percent, which covers almost all of my use cases, which is I just want one full            |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=568.28)  | scroll to equal one full animation.                                                                |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=571.2)   | So anyway, that's time range.                                                                      |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=573.08)  | And that's probably generally best practice anyway to keep your time range auto or a hundred       |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=577.24)  | percent of your scroll.                                                                            |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=578.92)  | So next we have scroll offsets and you can set a scroll offset when you want interaction           |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=582.76)  | to be scroll linked, but you don't want it to be scrolling to the entire scrollable area,          |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=587.46)  | just a portion of it.                                                                              |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=588.62)  | So for example, say I want to animate an image on scroll like you see on one of those Apple        |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=593.36)  | marketing sites, I could offset it so the animation begins when the element is already fully in    |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=598.24)  | view and finishes before the element fully leaves you.                                             |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=601.2)   | So I could have like the element appears, then there's some sort of interaction, then              |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=605.2)   | it disappears instead of having it be on the entire scroll timeline.                               |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=610.04)  | The scroll offset defaults to none.                                                                |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=613.12)  | And also keep in mind having one can create a better UX, but it's not required.                    |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=618.66)  | There are many scrolling experiences that don't need offsets or you wouldn't want an               |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=622.56)  | offset.                                                                                            |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=623.56)  | For example, those reading indicators that we mentioned where you're scrolling down the            |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=626.24)  | page and it kind of shows like a bar of how far down you are on the page, how far you're           |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=631.68)  | reading is.                                                                                        |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=633.12)  | And there are a few different types of offsets.                                                    |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=636.38)  | So do you want to kick off the types of offsets?                                                   |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=638.68)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=639.68)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=640.68)  | There's container based offsets, which is the default and these offset from the scroll             |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=643.04)  | container that's in the source of the actual scroll timeline and it accepts a length percentage    |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=647.84)  | type.                                                                                              |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=648.84)  | So it can be a percentage like zero to 100% or one rem or 500 pixels or some sort of length.       |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=654.44)  | And it's useful for a scroll completion and or scroll snap points.                                 |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=658.44)  | It's also useful for parallax and it's also useful for shrinking header effects because            |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=663.56)  | the container being scrolled needs to adjust one of the items based on an offset.                  |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=668.12)  | Oh cool.                                                                                           |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=669.12)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=670.12)  | That's kind of like if you're scrolling and then there's like a large profile area and             |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=673.44)  | it kind of shrinks and creates like a new little smaller UI area, but you can still                |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=679.08)  | see it.                                                                                            |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=680.08)  | I have a very clear vision in my head but not describing it very well.                             |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=682.12)  | Yeah, no, it's here.                                                                               |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=683.12)  | Let's say, okay, so the container based offset is...                                               |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=685.28)  | Twitter does this.                                                                                 |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=686.28)  | It's like I want to scroll this, I want to shrink the header only from the zero scroll             |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=691.8)   | position to 100 viewport height, for example.                                                      |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=695.16)  | That way you're offsetting the scroll effect so that it's only the first viewport set.             |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=700.2)   | And once they've done one full viewport scroll kind of gesture, the header would be completely     |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=705.4)   | shrunk.                                                                                            |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=706.4)   | So that's why it's a container offset as opposed to an element offset, which you're going to       |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=709.6)   | cover next, which would target when is this element in the viewport not offset the containers      |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=715.2)   | kind of bounds.                                                                                    |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=716.2)   | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=717.2)   | So that would be more of like the example where you want an image that kind of like                |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=720.44)  | comes in, does a thing, comes out because you're looking at the element as an element              |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=723.6)   | based offset.                                                                                      |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=724.68)  | So this offsets based on the intersection of the source scroll container and one of                |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=729.24)  | its children.                                                                                      |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=730.24)  | That element needs to be a child of that scroll container.                                         |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=733.92)  | It wouldn't make sense if it wasn't because it lives in the scroller.                              |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=737.68)  | So element based offsets except it values between zero and one.                                    |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=741.68)  | They're really useful for children, sort of entrance and exits.                                    |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=745.12)  | And they take an array of valid offsets.                                                           |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=748.4)   | So that offset is made of three pieces.                                                            |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=750.0)   | There is the target, which is a selector for a child element.                                      |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=755.24)  | This is the part of the target item that you would have to specify.                                |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=761.0)   | Then there's the edge, which is the element's edge based on the scroll direction.                  |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=766.32)  | And finally, there's the threshold.                                                                |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=767.7)   | So that could be zero or anything between zero and one or a discrete length value.                 |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=774.72)  | So for example, you could do like selector and then give it, I don't know, say it's a              |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=779.6)   | hero image and then start would be the keyword and then 0.5 would be the threshold.                |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=786.0)   | So this would be when a hero image starts at the top edge in the block direction.                  |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=791.04)  | So for, you know, we're thinking block, this is the default direction for like a Latin             |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=796.2)   | language.                                                                                          |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=797.38)  | It would start halfway into the viewport and then do its thing.                                    |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=800.88)  | So you can also have multiple offsets.                                                             |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=803.28)  | You could do a comma separated list of offsets where you set the target, the edge and the          |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=808.76)  | threshold.                                                                                         |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=809.76)  | So that example was the starting edge, but you could do the ending edge, like when it's            |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=813.36)  | like kind of at the bottom to the top in Latin language.                                           |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=818.2)   | And this accepts more than, you know, two, you can have multiple offset effects for element        |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=823.2)   | based scroll offsets.                                                                              |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=824.2)   | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=825.2)   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=826.2)   | That's a really complex topic.                                                                     |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=827.2)   | It's kind of like, I feel like when you do a scrolly telling UX experience, kind of like           |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=831.56)  | these Apple pages you're mentioning, they do a lot of element based offsets where this             |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=835.4)   | element is conscious of its, it just entered the screen.                                           |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=839.88)  | It's now moving in the middle of the screen and now it's exiting the screen.                       |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=845.38)  | And that would be three separate offsets.                                                          |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=847.16)  | And you'd be able to program that by saying, what's my scroll direction?                           |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=850.3)   | What's the edge and how much of this edge is in view when this animation starts?                   |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=855.4)   | It's pretty heavy stuff, but honestly I think it's some of the most important parts if you         |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=858.6)   | want to do some really robust scrolly telling, like this is where it's at, is in these offsets.    |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=864.6)   | I feel like while it is a new paradigm to think of when you're applying styles like                |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=869.36)  | this, that it's pretty straightforward.                                                            |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=870.36)  | Like the way that these are named feels like a solid API to me for directing how you want          |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=876.96)  | something to scroll entrance and exit.                                                             |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=879.36)  | And then the thresholds, that is something that as you're playing with it, you directly            |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=882.76)  | see a feedback for when it's entering and exiting.                                                 |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=885.76)  | The thing to know though is you definitely want to experiment with different screen sizes          |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=891.56)  | because the scroll will be different based on the viewport for the user.                           |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=895.88)  | So that is just something to think about, especially if you're doing responsive design,            |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=900.36)  | your elements are kind of shifting around based on your user experience.                           |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=904.72)  | So just like a little tip there for when you're using scroll timeline.                             |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=909.76)  | Yeah, that's a good tip.                                                                           |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=910.8)   | On my little phone, when I pan with my finger, I'm getting much more animation result than         |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=915.92)  | I am on my large desktop, right?                                                                   |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=918.0)   | Yep, totally.                                                                                      |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=919.56)  | There's a talk by Bramas who I think he summed it up, these offsets, the best so far that          |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=924.72)  | I've heard because yeah, it's kind of weird thinking about, okay, here's a target, here's          |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=928.0)   | an edge and a threshold, but he's kind of broken down into these combinations that he              |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=932.84)  | says these are the top combos and here's the animation goals.                                      |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=935.68)  | And so a couple of the animation goals are this is what you might get from a designer,             |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=938.96)  | how you're thinking about your scroll animation is the box is at the, or you're thinking about     |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=943.16)  | these element based offsets is the box is at the bottom edge of the scroll part, right?            |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=947.62)  | The box is at the bottom edge.                                                                     |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=949.16)  | That means the bottom of the box's edge is at the bottom.                                          |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=951.8)   | The box is fully in the viewport and its bottom edge just became fully in.                         |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=955.96)  | Or you have one that the box is above the top edge of the viewport, like it's completely           |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=959.72)  | exited.                                                                                            |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=960.72)  | So you can think about like, yeah, which edge am I wanting to observe and how much is it           |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=965.78)  | intersecting with the screen?                                                                      |
| [16:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=967.6)   | And then he goes on to have these top four combos, which are really awesome.                       |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=970.76)  | And he's got, so you mentioned earlier, you have like selector, then you have edge and             |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=974.68)  | then you have threshold.                                                                           |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=975.68)  | I'm just going to go through a couple of edge and thresholds so that not messing with the          |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=979.6)   | target concept.                                                                                    |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=980.6)   | And just so you can think about which edge and how much of it is in view is going to               |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=984.4)   | give you what kind of a visual effect.                                                             |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=987.14)  | And so if you have end zero, followed by a start zero, so this would be two different,             |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=992.92)  | you know, offsets, end zero, and then one at a start zero.                                         |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=996.54)  | This is something that is intersecting the scroll port.                                            |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=999.18)  | If you have something that's end one comma start one, it's in between the scroll port              |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1004.24) | edges.                                                                                             |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1005.6)  | If you have end zero and end one, it's entered from the bottom into the scroll port.               |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1010.44) | And if you have start one and start zero, it has exited at the top of the scroll port.             |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1016.8)  | So you might want to write those down or go find his article.                                      |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1019.56) | We'll have it on the show notes.                                                                   |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1020.56) | Yeah, that I think I need a cheat sheet.                                                           |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1022.44) | Yeah, definitely a cheat sheet.                                                                    |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1023.74) | This is kind of why I shared it and we'll have the link in the notes because it's really           |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1026.7)  | valuable.                                                                                          |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1027.7)  | Like when you're there, when you're sitting there thinking, you're like, ah, I can't remember      |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1029.88) | what zero and one meant and all the edges.                                                         |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1031.76) | You're like, oh, I'll just go look at parameters, this little quick cheat sheet.                   |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1035.48) | All of this just to say is CSS has given us some massive power to tell stories and keep            |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1040.92) | things animated and fluid and just interactive during a scroll interaction.                        |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1045.36) | It's so cool.                                                                                      |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1046.8)  | It's really cool because it is something that we used to hack around a lot.                        |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1050.4)  | And I mean, it's not in stable browsers yet, so you still have to hack around a little             |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1054.72) | bit.                                                                                               |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1055.72) | But it is really great to see it in experiments and available to you in a declarative way.         |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1061.74) | So if you're playing around with this, check it out.                                               |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1065.16) | It is behind a flag, experimental web platform features in Canary.                                 |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1069.7)  | And also some other tips, just like with the time range, that one's a little funky.                |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1074.8)  | So you probably want to keep the time range, the animation duration the same.                      |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1078.56) | That way the full scroll distance is the full animation length.                                    |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1080.88) | Again, you can use offsets so you could change things around as you need there.                    |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1084.8)  | But yeah, time range is a little bit tricky.                                                       |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1087.12) | I've almost never changed that one.                                                                |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1088.84) | So yeah, that's a great tip.                                                                       |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1090.32) | The other one, it's like set the easing to linear because you can set it to something              |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1093.96) | else.                                                                                              |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1095.2)  | It just gets really weird because you'd be scrolling and then seeing just like a little            |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1098.52) | bit of animation.                                                                                  |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1099.52) | And then as you get to the end of the scroller, it like all of a sudden get all hyper.             |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1102.84) | Anyway, it just feels much more tangible when my interaction feels directly related to the         |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1107.78) | animation.                                                                                         |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1108.78) | So anyway, try to keep the easing linear.                                                          |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1111.6)  | And then yeah, I mentioned earlier, I made a demo where I'm changing an app property               |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1115.94) | value in some key frames.                                                                          |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1117.76) | And it enabled me to scroll through an app property range.                                         |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1121.64) | So I went from zero to 100% or zero to 360 in a full page scroll.                                  |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1126.68) | And then I can just use that in color, use that in a gradient.                                     |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1129.48) | It just it's really cool and powerful stuff.                                                       |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1131.96) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1132.96) | Yeah, that sounds cool.                                                                            |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1134.4)  | There's also a JavaScript API.                                                                     |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1136.08) | So there's Web Animations API.                                                                     |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1139.08) | This is something that you can use to do scrolling to animations as well.                          |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1143.24) | You can also kind of use this to polyfill.                                                         |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1145.24) | This came out before the CSS declarative version.                                                  |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1147.8)  | It was like a precursor.                                                                           |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1149.92) | Rob Flack is an engineer that is working on these APIs.                                            |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1155.16) | Definitely check that out.                                                                         |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1156.16) | Because if you are working with JavaScript primarily and you want a more performant way            |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1162.24) | to introduce scroll linked animation, that might be a good solution for you, too.                  |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1167.88) | Yeah, I had to use the JavaScript API on my tabs example because I didn't know the width           |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1173.32) | of a tab.                                                                                          |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1175.24) | They were responsive tabs and they could be any width.                                             |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1177.68) | And in order for my animation to scale the little underline to match each of them, I               |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1182.64) | had to write some JavaScript that created key frames based on those widths.                        |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1186.76) | And anyway, it ended up being just a few lines of JavaScript.                                      |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1189.44) | But it was really cool.                                                                            |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1190.92) | You could also do like Bramas and Flacker do.                                                      |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1194.04) | They'll write JavaScript to iterate over the elements.                                             |
| [19:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1197.6)  | Maybe this is the same scenario.                                                                   |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1199.0)  | Grab those widths.                                                                                 |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1200.12) | But instead of using the JavaScript API, they create CSS.                                          |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1205.0)  | They write CSS string, console log it, and then they go grab the console log, stick it             |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1209.84) | in their CSS and delete the JavaScript.                                                            |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1212.36) | And yeah, it's just this super cool hacky way to make dynamic static CSS.                          |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1221.36) | That's funny.                                                                                      |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1222.36) | And also, when I said more performant, I didn't mean like the JavaScript API is more performant    |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1225.08) | than the CSS.                                                                                      |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1226.08) | What I meant was it's more performant than the existing JavaScript libraries out there             |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1230.52) | that you can use to do this because it comes directly from the browser instead of having           |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1235.68) | to go through reading page information, like getting sort of a second...                           |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1242.36) | It's not a shadow DOM.                                                                             |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1243.36) | It is just like a secondary view of the page to make these optical decisions that is really        |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1247.72) | not great for performance.                                                                         |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1248.9)  | But it's kind of what you had to do in the past for this stuff.                                    |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1251.84) | Yeah, I always said it's just JavaScript shows up late to the party.                               |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1254.84) | It's like the house is already painted and JavaScript's like, hey, what color are you              |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1258.0)  | painting it?                                                                                       |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1259.0)  | And they're just like, yo, we're done already.                                                     |
| [21:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1261.28) | Sorry, you've missed the boat.                                                                     |

| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4o1ateFDezB5lvAgDHC1tf?&t=1268.72) | This is definitely a fun show and an API they're both really excited about.                        |
