| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=17.6)    | Today we're talking about counters in CSS.                                                        |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=20.52)   | Counters let you create neat things like outlines and address their styles, but they're also      |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=24.52)   | a dynamic primitive on the page.                                                                  |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=26.68)   | This means you can do things like use counters to count how many checkboxes have been selected    |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=30.8)    | and make CSS games.                                                                               |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=32.78)   | But mostly counters are used for list styles and markers and we're going to cover all of          |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=36.84)   | that, how you can use counters and how you can even create your own.                              |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=40.76)   | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=41.76)   | Counters in CSS are an API into a functionality behind lists and that generated marker element,   |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=46.92)   | you know, like bullets and numbers.                                                               |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=48.44)   | CSS and the document can keep track of the order and index of elements and then allow             |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=52.72)   | you to use that string.                                                                           |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=53.96)   | Yeah, it's a typed string and it's a value wherever strings are accepted like pseudo              |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=59.32)   | elements colon colon before.                                                                      |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=61.36)   | And just like how lists can be nested and they build upon each other, so can custom               |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=65.64)   | counters.                                                                                         |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=66.64)   | They work from the outside in, they can be dots or a custom style, they can be simple             |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=70.92)   | or super complex.                                                                                 |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=72.28)   | I mean super complex, but ultimately they can offer some really neat visual support               |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=76.36)   | to your page.                                                                                     |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=77.36)   | So let's get started with how you create counters.                                                |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=79.86)   | The basic way to create counters as well, first of all, you need a name for your counter.         |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=83.12)   | So you got to give it a name, whether that's list counter, outline counter, super rainbow         |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=87.28)   | star counter, and then you set that using counter resets on a parent.                             |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=92.76)   | So you would set the counter reset property with the counter name as the value.                   |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=97.6)    | So you could set that on an unordered list.                                                       |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=99.6)    | You could set it on whatever parent you want to have contain the counters.                        |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=104.64)  | Then on each child that you want to be counted, you link it with the counter increment property.  |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=110.78)  | So you'd put counter increments and then the counter name, and you could do that on every         |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=114.82)  | list item, for example, and then every list item would be added to the count.                     |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=118.72)  | The counter increment property tells the browser what needs to be counted.                        |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=122.12)  | So you could do that for like, you know, list items, or you could do it for headers, like         |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=125.92)  | which specific headers you want counted, things like that.                                        |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=128.42)  | And then we can display these as content or as markers with the counter function.                 |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=133.96)  | So you could do something like li colon colon marker, the pseudo elements, and then within        |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=138.8)   | that set the content, the content property to counter and the counter name.                       |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=143.4)   | So it'd be counter and then in parentheses the counter name because it's a function.              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=145.96)  | That's how you use it.                                                                            |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=146.96)  | You can also set the name with counter style right after it.                                      |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=150.12)  | So you could have a counter name and set counter style and have that as a comma separated list    |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=155.56)  | as the two arguments that can go into counter.                                                    |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=157.4)   | But we'll get into that more in a minute.                                                         |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=160.76)  | Counters can track a single or multiple counters.                                                 |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=164.06)  | So that counter function I just went over, that accepts a name and then the optional              |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=169.0)   | counter style.                                                                                    |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=170.0)   | The counters function plural accepts its own counter name as well.                                |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=175.08)  | A string that joins counters together and also an optional counter style.                         |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=180.76)  | So you could track all your counters in one counter set.                                          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=183.4)   | And an example of that would be if you had that same like li marker pseudo element, you           |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=188.88)  | could set content to say you want to have parentheses around your counters.                       |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=195.4)   | You could do like in quotes and like open parentheses space counters, the counters function       |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=201.64)  | and then do like the counter name.                                                                |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=204.72)  | Say it's like list counter comma, then the joiner string.                                         |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=208.78)  | So that could be like a dot.                                                                      |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=210.04)  | So this would be like for the next nested counter.                                                |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=212.72)  | And then you close that function up and then you specify what's going to be on the other          |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=216.56)  | side of the counter.                                                                              |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=217.56)  | So you want to have a close parentheses and write all that together as like one sort of           |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=221.04)  | long string with a function inside of it.                                                         |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=224.04)  | So now we have specified multiple counters and that would make something that looks like          |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=230.64)  | this if you had an outline.                                                                       |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=231.68)  | So on the first level you'd have like a numeric value which is the default counter style.         |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=236.2)   | We didn't specify counter style in here with one surrounded by parentheses, then two surrounded   |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=241.24)  | by parentheses.                                                                                   |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=242.24)  | So if you nest in to one level it would be like 2.1, 2.2.                                         |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=247.92)  | That would be the next level because we have that dot joiner and it also is going to have         |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=252.28)  | that counter style with the parentheses outside of it and then etc, etc.                          |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=256.32)  | So yeah, it can get complex quickly but you can set counters and you can set counter styles.      |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=262.28)  | You can set counters plural or singular.                                                          |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=264.76)  | You covered so much good stuff right there.                                                       |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=266.92)  | I'm listening and I can see the code y'all, you can't.                                            |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=270.3)   | It looks like JavaScript.                                                                         |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=271.96)  | You're calling functions.                                                                         |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=272.96)  | Yeah, it literally does.                                                                          |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=274.44)  | Looks like a string template.                                                                     |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=276.74)  | It's a string template.                                                                           |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=277.74)  | Yeah, you're concatenating.                                                                       |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=279.08)  | You might as well have back ticks somewhere in here and use the dollar sign with open             |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=284.12)  | curly brackets.                                                                                   |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=285.12)  | Like we're using typed values, right?                                                             |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=286.5)   | It's typed strings and there's a whole algorithm that you're tapping into that you're invoking    |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=290.96)  | functions to work with inside of this loop, right?                                                |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=293.48)  | This is like a, anyway, this is totally programming and it is almost like you could go write this |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=299.42)  | in JavaScript and it would be so much work.                                                       |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=302.3)   | But here's CSS giving us three functions basically to kind of take care of all of these really    |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=307.8)   | complex use cases.                                                                                |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=309.44)  | Oh man, sometimes it's weird how when we're like recording these, it just dawns on me.            |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=314.78)  | It clicks.                                                                                        |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=315.78)  | It clicks.                                                                                        |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=316.78)  | Excellent, excellent explanation.                                                                 |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=317.78)  | Love it.                                                                                          |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=318.78)  | Okay, so I'm going to cover counter reset a little bit more.                                      |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=322.0)   | And so we use counter reset to scope and reset the counter to zero or something else.             |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=326.32)  | You can reset it to whatever you want.                                                            |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=327.72)  | In its simplest form, counter reset is used like this, counter dash reset colon, and then         |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=333.04)  | you specify like my custom counter and that would reset my custom counter to zero.                |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=337.32)  | So that's the simplest form, but you can also set it to something negative or you can reset       |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=341.52)  | multiple counter styles at once like counter dash reset colon, counter one to zero, counter       |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=347.04)  | two to 10.                                                                                        |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=348.42)  | You can cancel a previous reset with counter colon none.                                          |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=351.96)  | And MDN has this really nice example I just want to cover really quick where they have            |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=354.88)  | H1 open curly brackets and they have counter dash reset colon chapter space section space         |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=362.2)   | one.                                                                                              |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=363.2)   | So that resets chapter and section to start at one instead of zero.                               |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=367.36)  | And then they list page as the third counter that they're resetting and pages do start            |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=371.92)  | at zero.                                                                                          |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=372.92)  | So in one line of code you have created, well, they've already created the three different        |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=377.2)   | counters chapter, section and page, but they reset them all with one line of code, chapter        |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=382.6)   | space, section space one, space page.                                                             |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=385.44)  | It's just so elegant.                                                                             |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=386.44)  | I loved it.                                                                                       |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=387.44)  | Yeah, nice.                                                                                       |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=388.44)  | And also counter reset is required to kind of set up the counter in general before you            |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=393.16)  | can link it and start to have all that nice goodness.                                             |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=396.68)  | Easy one to forget.                                                                               |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=397.76)  | It's cool to see like how much you could really say in so few words when it comes to counters.    |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=405.12)  | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=406.12)  | Okay, so next we have counter increment.                                                          |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=407.52)  | So counter increment accepts the counter name as the value.                                       |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=410.9)   | And this, as I mentioned earlier, is used to count your value.                                    |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=414.04)  | So it tallies each item that's included.                                                          |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=417.44)  | So you could tally list items, you could tally.                                                   |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=419.0)   | It's like a plus plus or something.                                                               |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=420.92)  | Yeah, H2 is exactly like a plus plus, like things you want to add to the counter.                 |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=425.54)  | So you could have, you know, specific span elements inside of a paragraph that are counter        |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=429.5)   | incremented.                                                                                      |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=430.96)  | So you can get very specific with this or you can go broad and have more globalized               |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=434.64)  | elements here.                                                                                    |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=435.88)  | And then once we have that, we can pick a style for the counter, which is the counter             |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=439.52)  | style.                                                                                            |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=440.52)  | And this is that last argument for counter counters that is optional.                             |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=444.76)  | There are a few predefined styles, but you can also define your own styles using at counter       |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=450.2)   | style, which we'll get into in a minute.                                                          |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=452.48)  | But the predefined styles that the browser provides are decimal, which is like your numeric       |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=457.08)  | style.                                                                                            |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=458.08)  | There's decimal dash leading dash zero.                                                           |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=459.78)  | So decimal with the leading zero.                                                                 |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=461.92)  | And then there are a lot of localized styles.                                                     |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=464.5)   | So there's Arabic, Indic, Armenian, upper Armenian, lower Armenian, Bengali, Cambodian,           |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=470.64)  | Khmer.                                                                                            |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=471.64)  | There's CJK decimal, which I think is Chinese, but I'm not 100% sure.                             |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=477.32)  | Then there's, you know, I don't even know what some of these are.                                 |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=480.4)   | Devan Nagari, there's Georgian, there's Gujarati, there's Hebrew, there's Lao, there's Persian,   |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=488.84)  | there's Myanmar.                                                                                  |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=490.5)   | There's a lot of different localities of numbering systems that you can use for counter styles.   |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=497.6)   | Then there's also the lower Roman, upper Roman.                                                   |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=500.96)  | There's like Mongolian, Thai, Tibetan.                                                            |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=502.26)  | So all of these numbering styles are predefined in your browser and ready for use.                |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=506.84)  | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=507.84)  | I've used lower Roman and upper Roman before just because they look cool, you know, to            |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=512.28)  | have Roman numbers.                                                                               |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=513.28)  | Anyway, yeah.                                                                                     |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=514.28)  | The Roman numerals.                                                                               |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=515.28)  | Well, what's cool about these two is I was, other than their convenience, right, just             |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=518.48)  | being able to like tap into these and be like list style is upper Roman or whatever, is           |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=522.84)  | that you can go see the counter style definition.                                                 |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=525.72)  | So this is at counter dash style that they created to represent them.                             |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=529.42)  | So in the spec, they predefined all these localized counters using its own syntax.                |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=534.58)  | So the spec that tells you how to use it also defines a bunch of what, and you can just           |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=539.16)  | go take them.                                                                                     |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=540.16)  | You can go look at them and take them and put them in your code and just modify them              |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=542.84)  | a little bit.                                                                                     |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=543.84)  | And I thought that was super interesting.                                                         |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=546.04)  | So let's talk about creating our own counter styles, right?                                       |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=548.0)   | Maybe all of those that are predefined, that's not good enough and we want something special.     |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=552.2)   | Well, you have the power with CSS.                                                                |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=554.8)   | And so let's talk about the recipe of creating a custom at counter dash style.                    |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=559.32)  | So yeah, counter style, CSS at rule lets you define counter styles that are not part of           |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=563.24)  | the predefined set of styles.                                                                     |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=564.48)  | And you need to specify like how to convert a counter value into a string.                        |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=569.16)  | So you need a name for the style, an algorithm to transform integer counters into a basic         |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=574.16)  | string, a negative sign, which is prepended or upended to the counter value, a prefix             |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=578.84)  | to prepend, a suffix to append, a range to limit the values so the counter can cycle              |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=584.82)  | through something.                                                                                |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=585.92)  | You need a spoken form to describe how to read the counter to a speech synthesizer.               |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=590.84)  | And then lastly, you need a fallback style in case the counter value is out of the range          |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=595.38)  | of this custom counter style and it can't be rendered, it needs to know how to do that.           |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=599.24)  | So let's break down what some of those are so that you could define your own counter              |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=602.76)  | styles.                                                                                           |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=603.76)  | So, at dimension system is the first thing that you need to specify.                              |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=608.64)  | And system specifies which algorithm to use to convert the integer counter to a string.           |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=613.88)  | So this accepts the values of cyclic, numeric, alphabetic, symbolic, additive, fixed integer,     |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=622.72)  | and then you could also do an extends as Adam was kind of describing where you can extend         |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=627.2)   | an existing system.                                                                               |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=628.64)  | So cyclic should be like very normal or you've heard of this one or had it before.                |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=633.72)  | This is great for bullets where numeric or alphabetic are good for numbered or Roman              |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=637.24)  | lists.                                                                                            |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=638.24)  | Cyclic is good for just these flat lists.                                                         |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=640.12)  | Fixed is nice when you want to cycle through a controlled set of values, whether that's           |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=643.02)  | numbers or icons and run through that fixed set, then go back to the start and run through        |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=647.96)  | it again.                                                                                         |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=649.24)  | Symbolic is nice for repeating through a fixed set of symbols.                                    |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=652.2)   | Similar to how fixed works with a set of numbers and repeats, this will repeat through a set      |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=656.44)  | of symbols.                                                                                       |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=657.76)  | Numeric is nice for like spreadsheets or nested lists but it can be combined with numbers.        |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=663.48)  | So you could do things like 1a, 1b and build on top of that.                                      |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=667.28)  | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=668.28)  | Oh, good call.                                                                                    |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=669.28)  | Yeah, you can combine, you can change the system in a nested list state.                          |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=672.44)  | 1a.a.                                                                                             |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=673.44)  | Seriously, so cool.                                                                               |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=674.44)  | Okay, so then we have numeric and this is classic.                                                |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=677.92)  | This just with the 1, 2, 3 list.                                                                  |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=680.16)  | Additive is for systems like Roman numerals because these are kind of unique.                     |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=683.84)  | Roman numerals, for example, you have things like an x or an i would be a pending but then        |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=688.04)  | larger numbers concatenate like xi and then xx and they start to mean different things.           |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=692.88)  | So you need additive for those.                                                                   |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=694.28)  | Yeah, that's like a concatenation strategy, right?                                                |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=698.04)  | It's weird.                                                                                       |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=699.04)  | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=700.04)  | Okay, cool.                                                                                       |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=701.04)  | And the last one here is extends and it's special that it allows you to adopt the counter         |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=705.0)   | styles from another named and declared counter style.                                             |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=707.68)  | So by providing a mechanism to override certain aspects like the suffix, so you could like        |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=711.38)  | extend one but change the prefix or change the suffix.                                            |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=715.2)   | Think of like a list numbered one dot, two dot, three dot where the suffix is a decimal           |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=720.52)  | in each number.                                                                                   |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=721.52)  | You could extend the decimal style but just change the suffix with a like end parentheses.        |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=726.56)  | So it would be one parentheses, two parentheses, three parentheses and yeah, it's just that       |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=731.72)  | easy to extend and modify something.                                                              |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=733.72)  | Yeah, a few ways to do that.                                                                      |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=735.72)  | So there's also negative which defines what to do when a counter is negative.                     |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=740.72)  | It's not just numeric, that could be like negative A. It really is up to you and what             |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=745.6)   | your system is like.                                                                              |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=746.96)  | So if you have one value here, it's going to prepend it.                                          |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=750.0)   | So if you had, for example, like a negative as the property here and the value is like            |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=755.04)  | just like a like a end dash in quotes, it's going to add a like negative sign in the end          |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=760.8)   | dash before the value.                                                                            |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=762.78)  | If you have two values here that are space separated, it's going to let you surround              |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=766.52)  | it.                                                                                               |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=767.52)  | So the example that I was going through earlier with the parentheses, you could have parentheses  |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=772.2)   | in quotes before and then space and then parentheses in quotes right after that.                  |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=776.76)  | And this would surround say that negative number in parentheses.                                  |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=780.16)  | So you could wrap values or you could prepend values or you could have an empty string and        |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=785.4)   | then another value and that could be like appending to a negative value which would               |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=789.48)  | be confusing but I guess it's possible.                                                           |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=792.88)  | Yeah, it's like a cool little power.                                                              |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=794.68)  | Yeah, if you pass just one string in there, it will always prepend but if you pass two,           |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=799.4)   | it will wrap something.                                                                           |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=801.2)   | So cool.                                                                                          |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=802.2)   | So niche.                                                                                         |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=803.2)   | So many niche little things in CSS.                                                               |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=805.04)  | I know.                                                                                           |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=806.04)  | This is definitely one of those episodes that you could do a lot of really cool things with       |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=808.92)  | counters and I'm especially thinking like using, I don't know, symbols and images and             |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=813.36)  | all that sort of stuff in a very robust system but like it's very much a micro syntax to          |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=818.92)  | learn how to do that.                                                                             |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=819.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=820.92)  | And it turns out, I mean, we're kind of tangenting right now but yeah, this is something that's   |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=824.32)  | really hard for CSS to maintain.                                                                  |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=826.66)  | It's so powerful and so niche and it applies to so many things that it often becomes an           |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=832.74)  | issue.                                                                                            |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=833.74)  | That's what I like about doing this podcast is you find those little holes and parts of           |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=839.44)  | CSS, not really holes but CSS is just so big that when you add new features, you really           |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=844.24)  | have to think about how it affects every single part of the system and with things like, I        |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=848.84)  | don't know, you got to think about how do counters interact with like when marker was             |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=853.7)   | added, all of that, then you have to think about any layout algorithm changes, anytime            |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=858.02)  | you're changing directionality, writing modes, like it all trills down.                           |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=863.08)  | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=864.08)  | We just dropped a heavy bomb but let's go, we'll come back to the surface for a second.           |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=868.72)  | Very tangent.                                                                                     |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=869.72)  | Let's go back to defining counter styles.                                                         |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=871.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=872.92)  | All right.                                                                                        |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=873.92)  | Well, we got a prefix on our counter style, right?                                                |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=874.92)  | This is we just want to prepend anything to each marker and you can provide a string.             |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=879.44)  | So it comes before any prepended negative signs.                                                  |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=882.74)  | So that's kind of interesting that right, we have this negative sign and a prefix and             |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=885.76)  | a suffix, multiple things want to be in front or wrap your value and the prefix comes before      |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=891.68)  | any negative signs and the suffix is appended to each marker as a string and comes after          |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=898.0)   | any appended negative signs.                                                                      |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=900.1)   | So you can nest in multiple wrap things in multiple ways.                                         |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=904.86)  | So there's the order.                                                                             |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=905.86)  | The negative goes first, if it's a negative number, then you have prefix suffix and you           |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=909.68)  | can kind of like use existing systems and build on those.                                         |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=912.68)  | So I think like this is probably the easiest way to do that.                                      |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=915.0)   | You'd have the decimal system by default and then you could add prefix and suffix.                |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=918.44)  | Next we have range and range lets you define the scope or ranges of the counter style.            |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=923.04)  | So you could specify a list of numbers like one, five, eight, if you want to have like            |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=927.32)  | some funky range.                                                                                 |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=929.32)  | You also have some keywords here.                                                                 |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=930.92)  | There's auto.                                                                                     |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=931.92)  | The auto value is based on the counter system itself.                                             |
| [15:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=934.32)  | So like for alphabetic goes from one to positive infinity.                                        |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=937.16)  | There's also the infinite value and that allows ranges to go up to whatever value.                |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=942.76)  | And then you can also pass a lower and upper boundary.                                            |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=945.52)  | So you could have a dash like one dash 10 and have a boundary range for your values.              |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=952.72)  | Love it.                                                                                          |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=953.72)  | I love the range.                                                                                 |
| [15:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=954.72)  | Again, this is just so JavaScripty and I can just see the implementation details that I           |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=958.28)  | don't have to deal with because CSS is doing it all for me.                                       |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=961.4)   | I just get to pass in the value.                                                                  |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=962.6)   | It's like I get to call a already made function and it handles all these different use cases      |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=966.92)  | like auto and infinite and an upper lower boundary range.                                         |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=970.0)   | It's just so cool.                                                                                |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=971.0)   | Okay, sorry.                                                                                      |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=972.0)   | I'm just like sometimes so amazed repeatedly by CSS.                                              |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=975.64)  | It just gets me.                                                                                  |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=976.64)  | Okay, padding or pad.                                                                             |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=977.8)   | This is another counter style.                                                                    |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=979.52)  | So you're making an at counter style declaration.                                                 |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=983.04)  | You can specify padding and this lets you specify a fixed width style like think of               |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=988.36)  | 001.                                                                                              |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=990.0)   | So that's padded by two numbers.                                                                  |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=991.86)  | And you can do that in your counters just by adding this pad colon three space and then           |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=998.0)   | in quotes a zero.                                                                                 |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=999.42)  | So you're padding it.                                                                             |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1000.62) | You're making sure that the integer is always three items long and you're padding it with         |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1004.2)  | extra zeros.                                                                                      |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1005.2)  | Kind of cool.                                                                                     |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1006.2)  | I don't know if this necessarily relates to this kind of padding, but we like fixed width         |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1011.24) | styles because it prevents layout shift also.                                                     |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1013.4)  | Yeah, I was like, is this a CLS?                                                                  |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1016.28) | I think it is, huh?                                                                               |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1017.28) | It might be.                                                                                      |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1018.28) | I would find it hard to justify that in like the majority use case for counters, which            |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1021.72) | is lists and outlines.                                                                            |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1023.36) | Yeah, because they're inline instead of block, right?                                             |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1025.64) | Most CLS is block layout related.                                                                 |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1028.28) | But it does give you nice spacing throughout your outline.                                        |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1030.88) | It does give you nice consistent spacing.                                                         |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1032.4)  | So there's also symbols and symbols specify the marker representation.                            |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1037.04) | So they can be strings like A, B, C or D. They can be Unicode characters.                         |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1042.12) | You can even use images as the symbol.                                                            |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1045.32) | We got the Olympics coming up.                                                                    |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1046.96) | You could use like symbols colon and then an image URL like gold medal and you could              |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1051.4)  | have your symbols be like gold, silver and bronze medals.                                         |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1054.32) | And then you already have your list set up for a nice styled result page.                         |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1059.44) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                         |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1060.44) | You could use an OL, right?                                                                       |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1061.44) | An ordered list and you have the first three people each get a gold, silver and bronze            |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1066.82) | medal because you specified a custom counter style.                                               |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1069.76) | Exactly.                                                                                          |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1070.76) | I feel like the more you know CSS, the less you write JavaScript, as you were kind of             |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1073.92) | mentioning earlier.                                                                               |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1074.92) | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1075.92) | You can keep separating your styles from your logic.                                              |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1079.24) | And this is one example of where you can create a really nice robust counter system to do         |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1083.96) | a lot of the work for you, a lot of the styling work for you.                                     |
| [18:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1086.16) | I'm kind of surprised it's not used more.                                                         |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1088.0)  | Like the fact that you can pass an SVG in there as like a marker element and have it              |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1092.24) | like auto cycle through a whole bunch of custom.                                                  |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1095.12) | That's just so cool.                                                                              |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1096.12) | It is cool.                                                                                       |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1097.12) | I feel like what I would see more often is nth child.                                             |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1100.56) | So you'd use marker with nth child because you probably only have three in this case,             |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1103.88) | but you could have a case where you have a lot more and you wouldn't want to keep specifying      |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1108.96) | those individually.                                                                               |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1110.32) | This is also a little bit cleaner in the code.                                                    |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1112.4)  | You don't have to like write it three times.                                                      |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1113.8)  | It's kind of drier, if you will, to have like a counter versus like the nth child for all         |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1119.4)  | those values.                                                                                     |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1120.4)  | But you can do it either way because you're still using this through marker or through            |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1123.96) | content.                                                                                          |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1124.96) | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1125.96) | Yeah, this is just very reusable too.                                                             |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1126.96) | Like when you make these counter style at rules, I wonder if there's a site that just             |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1131.04) | has a whole bunch of them that you can go take.                                                   |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1133.0)  | Like here's all these cool at rules we made.                                                      |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1135.12) | Maybe.                                                                                            |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1136.12) | Either that or there's an idea.                                                                   |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1137.12) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1138.12) | And you can also use symbols in conjunction with system.                                          |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1140.84) | So you'll have to specify the system, whether it's like numeric and tallies up.                   |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1145.6)  | You have to define that property to define which symbols to use for it.                           |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1149.6)  | Like how the system works.                                                                        |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1151.52) | Good call.                                                                                        |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1152.52) | This next property on the at rule is called speak-as.                                             |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1156.64) | And this accepts values like auto, bullets, numbers, words, spell out, or counter style           |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1162.12) | by name.                                                                                          |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1163.12) | You can specify another counter style and we'll go look at how that one needs to be               |
| [19:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1166.28) | linked and auto is smart about the current system being used.                                     |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1169.56) | So it will look to see, right, that system property we keep talking about.                        |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1172.92) | If it's bullets, it's going to read it as bullets.                                                |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1176.04) | But where values like numbers will read the number out with the content.                          |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1178.92) | So you could say how this gets spoken to a screen reader and spell out could be kind              |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1183.28) | of cool if you had something custom.                                                              |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1185.0)  | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1186.36) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1187.36) | And then also you have fallbacks, which is an optional value to provide a fallback counter        |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1191.48) | style in case the current one can't create a valid rule within the rule set that you've           |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1196.32) | defined.                                                                                          |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1197.32) | So you can set specific fallbacks.                                                                |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1199.76) | You can kind of think of this like font fallbacks, but then ultimately the default is decimal.    |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1204.76) | So that's kind of like the system font.                                                           |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1206.6)  | The system fallback is decimal.                                                                   |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1208.52) | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1209.52) | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [20:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1210.52) | Well, that was it.                                                                                |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1211.52) | I mean, that was a lot.                                                                           |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1212.52) | Counters are definitely heavy.                                                                    |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1213.52) | They have multiple different use cases, lots of ways that you can like specify them and           |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1218.28) | hack with them.                                                                                   |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1219.36) | Let's talk about some, yeah, more hacks though.                                                   |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1221.24) | You've got a cool counter hack here.                                                              |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1223.44) | I'd love for you to share.                                                                        |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1224.6)  | What is this one?                                                                                 |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1225.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1226.6)  | So I used to use counters for like creating pure CSS games, which is a lot of fun to do.          |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1232.54) | One game in particular that I created and I actually built live at a conference.                  |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1237.18) | Like I built it on stage.                                                                         |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1238.6)  | Whoa.                                                                                             |
| [20:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1239.6)  | It was really fun.                                                                                |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1240.6)  | It was like a game where you had these targets and they would hide behind a box and you had       |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1245.84) | to click them when they were outside from the box.                                                |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1249.28) | And if you clicked it in time before the game ended, then it gave you a point.                    |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1254.62) | So it was kind of like a whack-a-mole game.                                                       |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1256.16) | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1257.16) | And yeah, it was like a CSS whack-a-mole.                                                         |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1259.36) | And I built this using entirely CSS, no JavaScript.                                               |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1262.76) | I used like animations to move it up and down, pointer events that you couldn't click when        |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1267.48) | it was behind the box.                                                                            |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1268.84) | And then when it was visible, I used counters.                                                    |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1271.82) | So I used counters on the checked inputs.                                                         |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1275.64) | Oh.                                                                                               |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1276.64) | I mentioned earlier that you can use counter increments on list items, on headers.                |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1282.24) | You can also use them on like inputs that are checked and that will add to your counter           |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1287.5)  | and increase the count.                                                                           |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1290.04) | This allows you to create those games because now you have elements that can be styled like       |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1294.72) | check boxes and you can have them move around your screen.                                        |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1298.64) | And if you click on them, then they're checked and then you can count them up.                    |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1303.18) | You can count the display up.                                                                     |
| [21:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1304.84) | And then you can visually display this using pseudo elements in the content property on           |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1309.88) | the page to display the counter, like the count on the page.                                      |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1314.28) | So I linked a CodePen bucket, CodePen collection of a bunch of pure CSS games.                    |
| [22:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1322.6)  | And the ones that are kind of like whack-a-mole are really fun and they use counters like         |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1326.46) | behind the scenes.                                                                                |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1327.46) | I love this.                                                                                      |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1328.46) | I don't, I had never thought about that.                                                          |
| [22:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1330.16) | So okay, you got your score for the game is essentially a pseudo element that's opting            |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1335.68) | into the counters called like score counter.                                                      |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1339.0)  | And every item that gets tapped just increments that counter.                                     |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1343.28) | What a cool like publish and subscribe.                                                           |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1346.44) | That's like PubSub.                                                                               |
| [22:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1347.64) | You've got something that's subscribed to the value from a pseudo element and then you            |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1351.2)  | have a bunch of things publishing values all from CSS.                                            |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1354.44) | Here's a question.                                                                                |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1355.44) | If you click something and checked increments, if you display none in an element, do you          |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1360.88) | lose the point?                                                                                   |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1361.88) | Do you have to persist elements on the page to keep the increment?                                |
| [22:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1364.76) | That's a great question.                                                                          |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1365.76) | I didn't do that.                                                                                 |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1366.76) | So I don't know what I did instead was the element froze.                                         |
| [22:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1369.68) | So I stopped the animation once it was checked because you can style checked styles.              |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1374.4)  | I had it displayed in grayscale and I had it like freeze wherever it was in the animation.        |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1380.12) | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1381.12) | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1382.12) | That makes sense.                                                                                 |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1383.12) | So yeah, the DOM node has to still be present.                                                    |
| [23:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1384.12) | It still has the checked state, right?                                                            |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1385.92) | Which is going to keep the increment going up.                                                    |
| [23:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1388.24) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1389.24) | Interesting.                                                                                      |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1390.24) | So cool.                                                                                          |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1391.24) | Wow.                                                                                              |
| [23:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1392.24) | Thank you for breaking that down so well.                                                         |
| [23:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1393.24) | Again, I'm amazed.                                                                                |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1394.24) | Easily amazed.                                                                                    |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1395.24) | Power of CSS.                                                                                     |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1396.56) | Never write JavaScript again.                                                                     |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1398.04) | I mean, if you can help it.                                                                       |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1400.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1401.6)  | All right.                                                                                        |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1402.6)  | So we got here's one of my counter hacks or ways that I've used it is I have a little             |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1405.92) | slide presentation framework called slide SLYD and it has slides that go from left to             |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1412.36) | right and up and down.                                                                            |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1413.96) | And I easily had numbering on them so I could number them from left to right going, you           |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1417.92) | know, slide one, slide two, slide three.                                                          |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1419.96) | But then I could go one A, one B, one C as you scroll down something because I could              |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1424.68) | use counters to just increment each slide.                                                        |
| [23:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1427.32) | So I had like a slide group that incremented and then each slide incremented its own nested       |
| [23:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1433.44) | slider.                                                                                           |
| [23:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1434.44) | So I had a list within a list using custom counters and allowed me to keep track of my            |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1438.28) | slides and just present the slide number really easily using CSS.                                 |
| [24:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1442.48) | I love it.                                                                                        |
| [24:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1443.48) | It's clever.                                                                                      |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1444.48) | Clever use of counters.                                                                           |
| [24:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1445.48) | Thank you.                                                                                        |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1446.48) | Well, I felt like, yeah, it's kind of appropriate, but it's just easy stuff.                      |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1449.44) | And I feel like I always forget to, it's reset.                                                   |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1451.96) | I think every time I go set up some custom counters, I'm like, it's not working.                  |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1455.0)  | What I do?                                                                                        |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1456.0)  | It's like, oh, I need to reset it.                                                                |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1457.0)  | Tell it where to start.                                                                           |
| [24:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1458.0)  | You can reset.                                                                                    |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1459.0)  | And I have another list like counter hack idea here, which was carousel dots.                     |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1463.36) | I felt like if you had like a slider and you wanted to show dots, you could probably use          |
| [24:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1467.6)  | counters to do that and use a decimal.                                                            |
| [24:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1469.32) | So you wouldn't show one, two, three.                                                             |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1470.62) | You just show dots.                                                                               |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1471.62) | They'd probably be read only.                                                                     |
| [24:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1472.88) | You couldn't click them to go to the element, but still kind of cool.                             |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1476.36) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1477.36) | Interesting.                                                                                      |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1478.36) | I think that would be read only, but you could also use speak as with custom counter styles       |
| [24:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1482.7)  | so that you have them be read to screen readers.                                                  |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1485.92) | It really depends on the use case here.                                                           |
| [24:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1487.12) | If it's just like a visual carousel thing, then you probably don't want to do that, but           |
| [24:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1490.92) | still cool.                                                                                       |
| [24:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1491.92) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1492.92) | Well, this is a fun episode.                                                                      |
| [24:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1494.32) | I love talking about like little niche CSS things.                                                |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1498.76) | These if you fall into a situation where you need to use them or create something custom          |
| [25:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1504.64) | are a really great tool and they definitely go deep.                                              |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1507.82) | So thank you so much for joining us this week.                                                    |
| [25:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1509.96) | We hope that you learned something new.                                                           |
| [25:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1511.44) | Yeah, I definitely did.                                                                           |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1512.72) | This is a tight system with pure functions.                                                       |
| [25:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1517.24) | I mean, I might as well be in like a really robust framework right now working with counters.     |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1521.2)  | This is super cool.                                                                               |
| [25:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1522.2)  | I think the main thing is it just like really does look like a template string in JavaScript      |
| [25:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1526.36) | when you're writing them.                                                                         |
| [25:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1527.36) | It does.                                                                                          |
| [25:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1528.36) | And when you're working inside of an engine, right?                                               |
| [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1530.84) | So just like when you're working inside a React or Angular, I always like to think of             |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1533.56) | these things like an engine that's spinning really rapidly.                                       |
| [25:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1536.12) | It's ready and it's very fast working, but you kind of throw things into it and get things        |
| [25:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1540.04) | back and if you don't do it right, it kind of...                                                  |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1542.28) | Anyway, it's just a very powerful ready to work engine as long as you're giving it the            |
| [25:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1547.72) | values it needs and you'll have a good experience.                                                |
| [25:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1549.68) | But yeah, if you've got any questions about this or if you have your own CSS counter hacks,       |
| [25:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0pYXkLEaj1HiBxEjTHHHYJ?&t=1554.96) | we'd love to talk about them on the show or answer your questions.                                |
