| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast season two, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=17.7)    | to Z-index.                                                                                       |

| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=22.8)    | go over various aspects of CSS, including the box model, sizing, layout, color, animations,       |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=28.68)   | and many more.                                                                                    |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=30.2)    | Our last episode was all about list styling and today we're diving into a pretty interesting      |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=34.8)    | and relevant topic, at rules.                                                                     |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=36.84)   | CSS totally at rules, Yuna.                                                                       |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=40.56)   | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=42.6)    | At rules are things like at font face, at media, and the newest at rule is at property.           |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=47.76)   | And at rule, some of which are technically called a CSS conditional, are specified by             |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=52.76)   | one of these identifiers and instruct CSS how to behave.                                          |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=56.64)   | Some of these are conditional rules and some of these are group rules where you can specify       |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=60.82)   | a group of information in one place.                                                              |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=63.08)   | We call them at rules because they begin with the at sign, the little a with the circle           |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=68.68)   | around it, if you just keep going, that at sign and contain a conditional group.                  |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=74.6)    | Awesome introduction.                                                                             |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=75.6)    | Yeah, there are all sorts in here and let's start with the one that hopefully most people         |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=80.06)   | have used or are most familiar with, at media.                                                    |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=82.72)   | And this is a conditional group rule that will apply its contents if the device meets             |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=86.5)    | the criteria of the condition defined using the media query.                                      |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=89.8)    | So this would be like, here's a condition if the screen is a type of print or if it               |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=94.28)   | is a screen.                                                                                      |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=95.28)   | And so you'd say at media space print, and instead of curly brackets, you'd specify a             |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=99.38)   | set of rules.                                                                                     |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=100.38)  | And so this is why it's a conditional group rule because there's a condition that has             |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=103.6)   | to be met based on the media.                                                                     |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=105.88)  | And if it's true, it will apply the rules inside of there.                                        |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=109.16)  | So condition with some rules.                                                                     |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=110.72)  | And then inside of the rules, you can start writing selectors like hashtag navigation             |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=115.5)   | and open up and do like a display none or something on that.                                      |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=117.76)  | And you can do sizing inside of these is where is inside of media with this like max width        |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=122.04)  | and min width and parentheses.                                                                    |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=123.04)  | So you have like these ways to put these conditionals inside of the at rule, at media, and then   |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=127.74)  | you specify a condition.                                                                          |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=129.16)  | And then again, yeah, you specify the rule.                                                       |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=130.66)  | So you'll find a lot of these conditional group rules follow this same flow, but they             |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=134.42)  | have different conditions that they're able to present.                                           |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=137.54)  | And at media comes with all sorts of sizing things based on the device itself.                    |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=142.82)  | And we can go into some of those at another time.                                                 |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=144.56)  | But yeah, that's what the app media conditional group rules for.                                  |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=147.64)  | Yes, that's a big one too.                                                                        |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=149.76)  | Next we have at supports, which is a feature query.                                               |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=152.7)   | So at support is a conditional group rule that will apply its content if the browser              |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=156.84)  | meets the criteria of a given CSS condition.                                                      |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=160.16)  | So you're looking for supports basically.                                                         |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=162.66)  | So you can write like at supports and then in parentheses background paint rainbow ties           |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=167.8)   | to test support for the CSS Houdini paint API.                                                    |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=171.02)  | You're looking to see if background colon paint, if that paint value as a function is             |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=176.34)  | recognized by the browser.                                                                        |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=179.1)   | So this is great for feature detection.                                                           |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=181.38)  | And if you're using this, which I would highly recommend you do use it if you're building         |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=184.96)  | anything with experimental CSS, make sure that your fallback lies outside of at supports          |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=190.1)   | because older browsers like IE 11, which you would be writing your fallback for don't actually    |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=194.36)  | support at supports.                                                                              |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=195.86)  | While modern browsers do, but make sure that that fallback exists outside of at supports          |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=201.0)   | because newer browsers will be able to apply the code inside of it.                               |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=204.32)  | So just like a little pro tip for if you're using at supports, which I think is great             |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=208.16)  | to use for some of the newer CSS and styles have the fallback outside.                            |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=213.42)  | Very nice.                                                                                        |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=214.42)  | We also have at document, which is a conditional group rule that will apply its contents if       |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=218.72)  | the document in which the style sheet is applied meets the criteria and the condition.            |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=222.24)  | So it's pretty much the definition of all of them.                                                |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=223.96)  | But this can be useful because you can say at document space URL, and you could say like          |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=228.18)  | my site.com and inside of that documents URL space only then will those styles apply.             |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=233.5)   | So you're sort of setting this condition based on the URL and the at document at rule has         |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=238.06)  | other ways to look at the document and apply conditional rules.                                   |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=241.5)   | So kind of a cool one to have in the back pocket.                                                 |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=243.54)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=244.54)  | And then there's at page, which describes the aspect of layout changes that will be               |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=248.86)  | applied when printing the document.                                                               |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=251.54)  | So these are things like margins, page breaks, orphans, a lot of those sort of print qualities    |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=257.78)  | that you might want to adjust.                                                                    |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=259.9)   | We will get into this more in a future episode on media queries, but there is a lot that          |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=265.46)  | you can do in styling printed pages of that page.                                                 |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=269.06)  | Definitely.                                                                                       |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=270.06)  | And that's similar to at font face, which folks may have used here as well, which describes       |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=274.48)  | the aspect of like an external font to be downloaded.                                             |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=277.08)  | And then it has all these properties inside of that at rule.                                      |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=279.28)  | So this one is not a conditional rule, so I'm not saying at font face if I'm just saying          |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=284.1)   | at font face, here's properties.                                                                  |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=286.1)   | And it takes things like a source.                                                                |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=287.22)  | So you can point to a relative or absolute path to a font asset.                                  |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=290.22)  | You can specify the font display.                                                                 |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=292.24)  | So like what does it do before it's downloading, while it's downloading and after you can sort    |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=296.04)  | of describe how you want that behavior to be.                                                     |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=298.78)  | You can set the font family, give it like a friendly name.                                        |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=302.04)  | So you're basically writing this little declarative entry that says, Hey, download this font,     |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=306.28)  | give it this name.                                                                                |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=307.28)  | I'll give you some properties about what I want in the font and then go from there.               |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=310.02)  | And we'll probably get into another episode about properties inside of at font face because       |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=313.58)  | there's powerful things like Unicode range.                                                       |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=316.04)  | And I've seen Jake and Surma severely reduce the download size of a font asset by specifying      |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=321.44)  | a small Unicode range.                                                                            |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=323.14)  | So anyway, there's lots of really advanced font setting properties inside of the at font          |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=326.9)   | face at rule.                                                                                     |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=328.24)  | To get even more in depth with font specification, you can use at font feature values.            |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=334.14)  | This is not currently supported in Chromium, but it is supported in Firefox and Safari.           |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=338.48)  | And at font feature values works similarly to font face in that you're declaring a list           |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=344.4)   | of values or like a group conditional statement, not a conditional, but a group statement of      |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=350.82)  | sorts where you're setting information in one place using this at property.                       |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=357.2)   | It is slightly different than at font face because it lets you interact with variable             |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=361.02)  | fonts and any open type fonts and set default values for their axes, which is important           |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=366.6)   | for how we interact with those types of fonts.                                                    |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=369.86)  | So basically you can use this to set entire font feature values that are used in the style        |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=374.66)  | sheet and one declaration per font family.                                                        |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=378.68)  | And then you can use those all together as a set of information.                                  |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=383.62)  | So those values include the values that you can set in here are things like at swash,             |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=389.88)  | which enable setting a display of swash glyphs.                                                   |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=393.12)  | So a swash is like, if you can envision a queue, think of the word like quill.                    |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=400.2)   | A swash glyph would be that same queue with the long tail that goes underneath other letters.     |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=406.94)  | So instead of like a standard queue that has its sort of square of space, it would be a           |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=411.94)  | swash that enters the space of other characters.                                                  |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=415.7)   | I don't know how else to describe it.                                                             |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=417.86)  | Cool.                                                                                             |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=418.86)  | That's awesome.                                                                                   |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=419.86)  | Cool.                                                                                             |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=420.86)  | So there's at calligraphy.                                                                        |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=421.86)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=422.86)  | There's at ornaments.                                                                             |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=423.86)  | So there are ornamental glyphs that typefaces sometimes have, and this you'd be able to           |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=427.16)  | set what the ornaments are.                                                                       |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=428.98)  | There's at annotation, which would be alternate forms for annotated elements, like stylized       |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=433.74)  | numbers you could have here.                                                                      |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=436.18)  | There's at stylistic, which enables the display of stylistic alternates.                          |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=440.22)  | And then there's at style set for any other axes that exist on the variable font, like            |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=446.0)   | sharp terminals, like things that you could set there with at style set.                          |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=449.26)  | So the way that you'd write this is at font feature values, you'd give that a name.               |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=452.98)  | And then inside of that would be your statement of values where you would have your at swash,     |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=458.46)  | at style set, at ornaments, at annotation, all those things.                                      |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=461.98)  | And then you could use that in your CSS with the name that you've given it.                       |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=466.46)  | That is so fun and so advanced.                                                                   |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=468.66)  | I'd have only like seen some of these properties get managed, you know, directly on the element   |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=472.82)  | that has the variant or the font, the variable font.                                              |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=476.78)  | This is really cool.                                                                              |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=477.78)  | The font and font face, like they go pretty in depth and you can do some cool things there.       |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=481.98)  | Again, this is experimental, not all modern browsers support it yet, but I can see this           |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=486.54)  | being something that is accessible across browsers soon because the feature is variable           |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=491.42)  | fonts and we're seeing more and more of those sort of evolve.                                     |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=494.06)  | Absolutely.                                                                                       |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=495.06)  | And variable fonts just come jam-packed with all these super rad features and all you need        |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=499.14)  | to know is how to access them through these little properties.                                    |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=501.9)   | And this is, wow, super cool.                                                                     |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=503.86)  | Fonts, amazing.                                                                                   |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=504.86)  | Thanks for sharing that one.                                                                      |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=506.26)  | We have at key frames next, and this describes the aspect of intermediate steps in a CSS          |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=511.94)  | animation sequence.                                                                               |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=512.94)  | So this is just like a declaration that says, here's some key frames.                             |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=515.62)  | It's almost like saying, here's a timeline.                                                       |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=517.78)  | And I want you to start here and go here and apply these properties at those times.               |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=521.98)  | And we've talked about key frames before and how like, you know, it's full of key frame           |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=525.3)   | effects and it gets broken down, but the at key frame at rule allows you to declaratively         |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=529.98)  | set that animation as like a unit with a custom name.                                             |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=533.44)  | Super cool.                                                                                       |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=534.44)  | We have a quick follow up here for at scroll timeline, which is another at rule here.             |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=539.34)  | And this one allows you to define a different animation tick.                                     |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=543.08)  | So usually animations run on like your screen refresh rate and an scroll timeline allows          |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=547.52)  | you to say, well, look at this scrolling element and use that element's scroll position as        |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=552.18)  | a timeline to drive another animation.                                                            |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=554.18)  | So it's just another declarative way for CSS to say, take this chunk of styles with this          |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=558.46)  | name and I'm going to use it later.                                                               |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=560.06)  | It's really fun.                                                                                  |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=561.06)  | And then there's at viewport, which describes aspects of the viewport for various screen          |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=567.86)  | devices.                                                                                          |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=568.86)  | So this is currently in the working draft stage and this is very similar to the viewport          |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=572.86)  | meta tag.                                                                                         |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=574.54)  | Know that the viewport meta tag, which looks like meta name equals viewport will override         |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=579.38)  | the at viewport at rule.                                                                          |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=581.76)  | So what you could do with at viewport is specify things like the zoom, the minimum zoom, the      |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=587.38)  | maximum zoom, the min width and max width for the page.                                           |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=590.62)  | I think that it's really interesting here that we're kind of converting the capability            |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=594.38)  | of this meta tag into a at rule that you can then have like this grouping of information          |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=601.86)  | and have that specify how you want zoom and sizing to work for your screen device.                |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=608.3)   | Awesome.                                                                                          |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=609.3)   | And at the beginning of season two, the previous episode, we talked about lists.                  |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=613.44)  | And in that episode we talked about at counter style, which is another at rule.                   |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=617.1)   | This one defines specific counter styles that are not part of the predefined set of counters      |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=621.06)  | that come with the browser.                                                                       |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=622.06)  | So the browser comes with a whole bunch of fun counters, but maybe you want to roll your          |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=625.38)  | own and this lets you define it and leverage it from another style property.                      |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=629.74)  | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=630.74)  | More in that episode about counter styles, if you're interested in making your own sort           |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=634.48)  | of set of counters.                                                                               |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=637.62)  | Next we have at property, which describes custom properties with advanced values, just            |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=642.62)  | syntax, fallback values, and if the value inherits or not from its parents.                       |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=647.46)  | This is a part of the CSS Houdini properties and values API, and essentially is a way to          |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=651.74)  | write those advanced CSS custom properties in your CSS.                                           |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=655.1)   | Whereas before this was introduced, you could only do this in JavaScript.                         |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=658.98)  | I think that this is great because you can now co-locate those advanced custom properties         |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=663.52)  | with the rest of your styles.                                                                     |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=664.98)  | And there are a lot of benefits to using those, including error handling with fallback values     |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=669.72)  | and better transition states for your custom values.                                              |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=673.0)   | We did an entire show on CSS Houdini, the properties and values API specifically, which           |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=678.36)  | is episode 26.                                                                                    |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=680.02)  | So check out episode 26, where we go more in depth on this topic.                                 |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=686.22)  | Also be aware that this is currently in the working draft stage.                                  |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=688.34)  | It is implemented in Chromium and there are poly fills for this if you were interested            |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=693.14)  | in using app property for CSS custom properties.                                                  |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=696.5)   | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=697.5)   | And a lot of these app rules are really great for progressive enhancement as well, because        |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=701.82)  | something like that where you can enhance your custom properties to have a transition             |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=705.58)  | between gradient colors if the browser is able to understand app property.                        |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=709.68)  | If it's not, well, then it will just jump to the thing and nothing's broken.                      |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=712.5)   | It just won't be as elegant.                                                                      |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=713.9)   | So these are kind of fun that the classic CSS, right?                                             |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=716.78)  | It'll read it and if it doesn't know it, it's all good.                                           |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=719.04)  | The next one I have here is at import, and this lets you bring in a relative or absolute          |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=723.38)  | CSS resource, accepts a list of media queries that must pass in order for the resource to         |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=727.98)  | apply.                                                                                            |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=728.98)  | So it's kind of like a conditional at rule, but it doesn't have a, it's not a conditional         |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=733.02)  | group.                                                                                            |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=734.02)  | This is just a conditional at rule.                                                               |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=735.66)  | And that'll come important later in just a second.                                                |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=738.38)  | But you can say, Hey, I want to go grab my projector style.                                       |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=741.68)  | So I have a file called projector.css, but only downloaded it if these set of media queries       |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=746.42)  | pass.                                                                                             |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=747.42)  | And you can set a bunch of conditions.                                                            |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=748.82)  | And so it can be really nice, but there is a couple of conditions for even using at import        |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=753.22)  | like it must be in front of all other types of rules except at charset, which we'll go            |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=759.26)  | over at charset in a second, but it basically at charset needs to be first and then your          |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=762.98)  | imports need to happen.                                                                           |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=764.06)  | So it's not as dynamic as some of the other ones, but it does have a lot of power with            |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=768.9)   | just few exceptions.                                                                              |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=770.26)  | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=771.26)  | So next we have at prefers media queries, which are part of media queries level five.             |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=777.18)  | It's currently in an editor's draft and these are user preference media queries that are          |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=781.14)  | based on the operating system preferences of the user.                                            |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=785.26)  | And so there are a few of these.                                                                  |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=787.18)  | The first one is at prefers reduced motion.                                                       |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=789.76)  | This detects user preference for those who prefer less motion on the page.                        |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=793.86)  | Maybe they get sick when there's a lot of movements and this helps them to provide input          |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=799.34)  | on the user experience they want for them visiting any app or website.                            |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=803.94)  | And so the values here would be no preference or reduce.                                          |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=806.54)  | There's also at prefers reduce transparency, which detects user preference for those people       |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=811.5)   | who prefer reduced transparency and therefore more opaqueness on the page for better legibility.  |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=816.86)  | And the values here again are the same at no preference or reduce.                                |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=820.86)  | There's at prefers contrast, which detects user preference for increased or decreased             |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=825.54)  | color contrast.                                                                                   |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=827.34)  | And the values here are no preference, less, more, or forced.                                     |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=831.34)  | So there are a few more values here for the contrast preference.                                  |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=835.54)  | And then we have prefers color scheme, which detects the user preference for light or dark        |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=839.9)   | color schemes, which can also be set to auto on a user's OS for day to night shifts.              |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=845.5)   | And the values here for the preferences are light and dark.                                       |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=849.0)   | And finally, there's prefers reduced data, which detects user preference for reduced              |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=854.26)  | data usage when loading a page.                                                                   |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=856.78)  | And the values there are no preference or reduce.                                                 |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=859.78)  | So all of these do have some potential privacy issues because they are pulling information        |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=864.36)  | in from the user's operating system to make decisions about their user experience.                |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=870.1)   | I feel like overall these are a net positive for UX because you can sort of think of these        |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=874.5)   | as a way to more fully customize the experience of your user on your website or app.              |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=880.92)  | But we'll go into these preference media queries in more detail in an upcoming show, along        |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=885.14)  | with some examples of where and how you would use these.                                          |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=888.28)  | And Adam has been working on some really cool examples of things like prefers reduced motion,     |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=893.86)  | how you can apply that in a way that doesn't completely remove motion from your page.             |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=897.66)  | Yep.                                                                                              |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=898.66)  | I'm a big fan of all these.                                                                       |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=899.66)  | They're really fun.                                                                               |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=900.66)  | I've been following the privacy issues too.                                                       |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=902.58)  | And it's essentially they're just folks are fingerprinting you.                                   |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=905.18)  | So it's like you visit the page and they take all of your custom user settings that they          |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=909.38)  | can find about you and make a little data entry for you.                                          |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=912.64)  | And then if they see that same entry pop up somewhere else in the web, someone is tracking        |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=916.88)  | you now.                                                                                          |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=917.96)  | So it's like you're bringing, hey, this is me.                                                    |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=920.8)   | You're bringing a little bit of me to the table by allowing these operating system user           |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=924.46)  | preferences to leak into the browser.                                                             |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=926.42)  | And I'm not really sure how they're going to resolve some of these things.                        |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=928.78)  | It gets really tricky, but I'm excited because I strong agree.                                    |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=932.08)  | These are net positive.                                                                           |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=933.08)  | There's some really, really cool stuff that you can do with prefers reduced data.                 |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=937.58)  | I feel like the contrast one, we need that now so that we can have our cake and eat it            |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=941.66)  | too.                                                                                              |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=942.66)  | We can have nice light feeling themes, but then we can make a more high contrast stark            |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=947.1)   | theme for folks that need it.                                                                     |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=948.74)  | It just sounds like fun, honestly.                                                                |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=952.5)   | The next one we have here is at char set.                                                         |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=954.4)   | And this one specifies the character encoding and the style sheet.                                |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=957.42)  | It must be the first element with no spaces in front of it at the top of the file.                |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=962.58)  | And if that sounds familiar, you might be thinking of use strict from JavaScript.                 |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=967.42)  | I found that it operates in a very similar fashion.                                               |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=970.42)  | There's also at namespace, which I've never used before, but this was kind of interesting.        |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=974.8)   | This specifies the XML namespaces for the style sheet.                                            |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=977.68)  | So it's like when a default namespace is defined, all universal and type selectors, but not       |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=982.42)  | their attribute selectors apply only to the elements in that namespace.                           |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=985.8)   | So like a good example here is I say at namespace, SVG, URL, and then I pass a URL to an XML      |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=994.54)  | namespace.                                                                                        |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=995.54)  | And that will allow me to then write a new special kind of selector that uses a new combinator    |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1001.2)  | that I've never seen.                                                                             |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1002.2)  | And it's called the namespace combinator.                                                         |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1004.52) | It's the pipe character.                                                                          |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1005.52) | And the pipe is the vertical straight line.                                                       |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1008.86) | So it's not the leaning forward or leaning backward slash.                                        |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1011.54) | It's just the standing straight up vertical one.                                                  |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1013.6)  | And that would let you write SVG pipe A open parentheses and say color, you know, awesome.        |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1020.86) | And then end your parentheses.                                                                    |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1022.48) | And that targets only anchors that are inside of the SVG namespace.                               |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1026.98) | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1027.98) | It's almost like-                                                                                 |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1028.98) | Wow, that's fascinating.                                                                          |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1029.98) | I didn't know that was a thing.                                                                   |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1031.74) | Me neither.                                                                                       |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1032.74) | And it kind of makes sense in a lot of cases.                                                     |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1034.38) | So that's in the browser.                                                                         |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1036.06) | You've got at namespace and any at namespace rules, they must follow at character set and         |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1041.16) | at import rules.                                                                                  |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1042.7)  | And then they also must precede all other rules and style declarations in the style               |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1046.34) | sheet.                                                                                            |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1047.34) | So right now we're kind of saying that some of these at rules, I have forced order.               |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1050.26) | And one of them is you have to have your character set at top.                                    |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1053.64) | Then you need to have your import rules.                                                          |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1056.74) | And then you can say your namespaces.                                                             |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1058.56) | So these are a little tricky, but they can have some high value out of them.                      |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1062.9)  | Very cool.                                                                                        |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1063.9)  | So here I found a couple of interesting things about at rules as just a follow up, because        |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1067.78) | that was a recap of all of the at rules that we can safely talk about on this episode right       |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1072.46) | here.                                                                                             |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1073.46) | But I wanted to talk about a feature I noticed that each conditional group here, so each          |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1077.34) | at rule that's a conditional group like at media or at support can also contain nested            |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1082.42) | conditional at rules.                                                                             |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1084.32) | So you could put an at media query inside of an at media query right now and that's               |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1088.98) | supported.                                                                                        |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1089.98) | So that's a type of nesting already built into CSS that I don't know if many people               |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1094.34) | know exists.                                                                                      |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1096.26) | So that was kind of cool.                                                                         |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1097.26) | And then the last thing I find about at rules that's really interesting is post CSS lets          |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1101.2)  | you define custom ones really easy.                                                               |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1102.94) | So if you wanted to come up with a new one like at awesome and you could use that in              |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1106.44) | post CSS in any other way you want, right?                                                        |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1108.26) | You're just declaring a little set of rules with this style tag.                                  |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1110.82) | And then later you can go grab it and apply it in some way.                                       |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1113.78) | And at rules just have this really fun flexibility.                                               |
| [18:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1116.66) | I feel like they're the first place that custom CSS authors or even spec authors go to think      |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1121.82) | about how to create new declarative stuff in CSS.                                                 |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1125.86) | And I don't know, I just at rules or so I said CSS at totally rules.                              |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1129.18) | I totally believe that.                                                                           |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1131.3)  | And at rules are just packed full of all sorts of fun.                                            |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1134.14) | I don't know.                                                                                     |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1135.14) | Anyway, that's all I got.                                                                         |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1136.14) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1137.14) | And this show is definitely diverse in terms of the range of topics that we covered with          |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1140.74) | at rules.                                                                                         |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1141.74) | And it's because it is a mechanism in order to introduce ways to style things.                    |
| [19:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1147.1)  | So whether it's conditionals or whether it's grouped rule information, I think this is            |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1152.14) | a space that does change a little bit faster than other spaces because it is a place to           |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1156.46) | introduce new styles.                                                                             |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1158.62) | And it kind of shows that with post CSS, they chose the at syntax for introducing some custom     |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1164.1)  | styling very, very quickly.                                                                       |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1167.7)  | And yeah, I think that makes sense.                                                               |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1169.66) | It's an interesting space to watch at rules we use every day and they're definitely something     |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1175.38) | that is a core part of CSS.                                                                       |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1177.14) | But sometimes we don't really think about how deep you can go and how deeply you can              |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1181.38) | nest these things and how specifically you can specify page styles and like font variant          |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1186.26) | settings and things like that.                                                                    |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1188.28) | So it's pretty cool to like kind of just dive into the stuff.                                     |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Y7NXhNzM5oT0Qbcrq8pwn?&t=1191.18) | Well, that's our episode on at rules.                                                             |
