| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=17.08)   | Today's episode is about CSS Grid.                                                                  |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=19.84)   | This episode builds upon the last episode about Flexbox digging into grid-specific features.        |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=25.3)    | The track list we've broken these down into, yeah, get it?                                          |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=28.2)    | Jokes, tracks, haha, so full of these terrible ones.                                                |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=32.0)    | But we're talking about tracks, gaps, areas, and flow today.                                        |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=35.8)    | And grid also features alignment and distribution features, you know, like flex, but we thought     |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=39.32)   | we covered those well in the Flexbox episode.                                                       |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=41.8)    | So grid to me has two parts.                                                                        |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=43.6)    | I keep in mind when laying things out, it's like how the container should behave and how            |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=47.36)   | the children of that container should behave.                                                       |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=49.58)   | And with that in mind, now onto grids unique web layout feature set to study grids features.        |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=54.46)   | You know what you got.                                                                              |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=55.52)   | Before we get into the functions and all of the properties of a grid, we should talk about          |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=61.2)    | the terms and keywords because when you have a new layout algorithm, you have a lot of              |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=65.24)   | new keywords that enable that layout goodness.                                                      |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=68.14)   | So let's go through those and then we'll get into how you can create some awesome grid              |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=72.4)    | layouts.                                                                                            |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=73.4)    | Do you want to start with some terminology?                                                         |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=74.4)    | Yeah, let's start with lines and lines are the horizontal and vertical dividing lines               |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=78.38)   | of the grid.                                                                                        |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=79.38)   | If you're familiar with the Firefox grid dev tools, these are the numbers they show between         |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=82.96)   | your rows and columns.                                                                              |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=83.96)   | Then we have tracks.                                                                                |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=84.96)   | A track is the space between two grid lines.                                                        |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=88.28)   | It's also a word for a generic row or column, not including the gaps.                               |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=92.28)   | Cells which are the intersection of a grid row and a grid column.                                   |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=95.08)   | Like in a spreadsheet, a cell is holding a single value in that matrix.                             |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=98.2)    | Then we have areas and these are the sections within grid lines, the grid areas, which you          |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=103.04)  | can also name.                                                                                      |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=104.04)  | And they consist of one or more adjacent grid cells bound by four grid lines.                       |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=108.6)   | We also have templates.                                                                             |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=109.8)   | And so the parent grid definition, which defines how the child items are placed in size and         |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=114.48)  | how this pattern should be repeated.                                                                |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=116.4)   | There's also gaps within grid and these are contentless tracks.                                     |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=120.2)   | They are the space between areas, rows and columns that are owned by the parent grid.               |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=124.8)   | And last we have spanning.                                                                          |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=126.48)  | This is an element can span multiple cells reaching further across tracks to consume                |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=130.52)  | an additional cell for higher row or a wider column.                                                |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=134.12)  | There's also a couple of new keywords that you can use in your CSS.                                 |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=137.72)  | And the first one to mention is min content and max content.                                        |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=141.52)  | And these refer to the intrinsic content size.                                                      |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=144.46)  | So say you have a paragraph with the sentence, my dog is adorable.                                  |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=147.4)   | Yes, he is.                                                                                         |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=148.44)  | He is.                                                                                              |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=149.44)  | The max content for this paragraph is the width only until the end of that sentence,                |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=154.66)  | the max amount of content in that paragraph.                                                        |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=157.28)  | The min content though, would be if you took the sentence and squeezed it and had the words         |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=162.98)  | wrap onto each of its own individual lines, then the length of the longest word, adorable           |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=168.56)  | in this case, would be the min content.                                                             |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=170.98)  | I think these are really critical too.                                                              |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=172.62)  | And you broke them down really good talking about a sentence because a sentence has these           |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=175.5)   | like natural breakpoints, which are spaces in a word.                                               |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=178.38)  | And I like to think of min and max content also like in terms of my body and other humans'          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=183.32)  | bodies.                                                                                             |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=184.32)  | And that's because each type of content that's, this is min content and max content.                |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=187.46)  | It's always relative to the content itself.                                                         |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=189.08)  | It's like each person has their own body.                                                           |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=191.2)   | Each body can reach to its max height or squish down into its minimum amount, like a fetal          |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=196.52)  | position, but it can't go any smaller than where its smallest breakpoints are in its                |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=200.72)  | own content.                                                                                        |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=201.72)  | So you said it right.                                                                               |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=202.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=203.72)  | Without chopping some off.                                                                          |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=204.72)  | Without chopping some off.                                                                          |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=205.72)  | Like you think of your arm, your arm extended to its max length, or its max content goes            |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=209.72)  | all the way out.                                                                                    |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=210.72)  | Like it extends at its bendy areas.                                                                 |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=211.72)  | But if you go to its min content, you would bend at your wrist and at your elbows and               |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=215.52)  | constrict your arm into its smallest minimum content space without breaking it.                     |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=219.32)  | Anyway, you did a great job.                                                                        |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=220.76)  | I hope I enhanced it.                                                                               |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=221.96)  | Maybe I didn't, but I just like thinking of it that way.                                            |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=224.24)  | We also have min max.                                                                               |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=225.46)  | And so min max is greater than or equal to minimum and less than or equal to maximum.               |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=230.24)  | So it's like in its name, but kind of interestingly, this like literally breaks down into min max   |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=234.64)  | parentheses, zero comma one fr.                                                                     |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=237.28)  | So min max is actually made up of a min max, which is kind of mind blowing.                         |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=240.52)  | But anyway, it's basically trying to say never go smaller than my minimum content size, but         |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=244.68)  | do let me stretch to fill remaining space.                                                          |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=247.02)  | So there's a function that's akin to min max, which is really interesting.                          |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=249.96)  | And it's the fit content function.                                                                  |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=252.92)  | You can use this function within your grid template declarations to determine sizing                |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=256.44)  | as an argument.                                                                                     |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=257.74)  | So for example, you can write grid template columns and then fit content 300 pixels.                |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=262.16)  | And what this will do is it'll clamp the maximum width of that element to 300 pixels.               |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=268.28)  | So it's clamping it at the argument size, but the minimum size where the other end is               |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=273.2)   | going to be the auto size of that grid element itself, that grid item.                              |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=278.2)   | So it's kind of like a way to clamp between auto and that argument.                                 |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=282.04)  | And it's pretty cool to have.                                                                       |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=283.28)  | Sick.                                                                                               |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=284.28)  | That's awesome.                                                                                     |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=285.28)  | I don't think I've used that enough.                                                                |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=286.28)  | And you just broke that down in a way.                                                              |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=287.44)  | I want to go use it.                                                                                |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=288.6)   | So thank you.                                                                                       |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=289.6)   | We also have fr units in grids.                                                                     |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=291.66)  | So these are fractional units.                                                                      |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=293.84)  | And one fr is basically saying if there's empty space, I want to consume the rest of                |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=298.76)  | it.                                                                                                 |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=299.76)  | And if there's multiple people competing for that space, we'll share it and we'll evenly            |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=302.38)  | distribute the extra space amongst ourselves.                                                       |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=304.7)   | It's sort of also interesting that one fr is equal to min max parentheses auto comma                |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=308.98)  | one fr.                                                                                             |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=309.98)  | So like be my automatic size unless there's available space to stretch into and then stretch        |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=314.3)   | into it.                                                                                            |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=315.3)   | There's also the repeat function, which is a really convenient function for writing grid            |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=318.54)  | templates.                                                                                          |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=319.54)  | So for example, if you had a section with a grid template column of repeat six comma                |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=324.98)  | one fr, that would give you a six column grid with each column having a one fractional unit         |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=330.98)  | unit size.                                                                                          |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=332.38)  | So it just makes it easier for you to write grid templates.                                         |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=335.1)   | It even reads really well, right?                                                                   |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=336.38)  | You're like, I want three columns at 300 pixels each.                                               |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=338.86)  | You're like repeat three, 300 pixels.                                                               |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=341.02)  | It's great.                                                                                         |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=342.02)  | It's brilliant.                                                                                     |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=343.02)  | We also have auto fit and auto fill.                                                                |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=345.1)   | So similar to wrapping requests, but with some additional details to note.                          |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=348.86)  | So this is for wrapping.                                                                            |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=349.86)  | If you want your cells to continue going and then hit a wall and fall underneath and continue       |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=353.98)  | being a template column.                                                                            |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=355.54)  | And each of these, so auto fit and auto fill tries to put as many cells into the containers         |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=360.98)  | with as long as it doesn't cause overflow.                                                          |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=363.02)  | So it's trying to maximize a track and fill into a track space and auto fit will create             |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=368.34)  | empty cells to fill remaining space.                                                                |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=370.36)  | So like if the space that this auto fit is trying to fit into has extra space, it won't             |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=374.84)  | stretch to fill it.                                                                                 |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=376.06)  | Whereas auto fill will distribute remaining space to children if it's available, ensuring           |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=380.5)   | that the row is filled.                                                                             |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=381.98)  | And then there's auto, which is sort of the same as max content, where it automatically             |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=385.38)  | takes the space available based on the size of its children.                                        |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=388.82)  | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=389.82)  | So we've got tracks coming up next and this is where we're going to deal with implicit              |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=393.36)  | or explicit grids and the grid template column syntax or grid template row syntax unit.             |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=398.86)  | Tell us about that.                                                                                 |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=399.86)  | So the first way that you can write this is explicitly.                                             |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=402.66)  | You can write an explicit grid template.                                                            |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=405.3)   | And in order to do that, we need to assign rows and columns to the grid and define their            |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=409.02)  | size.                                                                                               |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=410.02)  | So yes, I said both rows and columns because with CSS Grid Layout, we as developers can             |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=414.42)  | adjust both vertical and horizontal layout styles.                                                  |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=418.34)  | If you listened to our last episode on Flexbox, you might be wondering, doesn't Flexbox do          |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=422.36)  | that too?                                                                                           |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=423.5)   | And the answer is not really.                                                                       |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=425.54)  | With Flexbox, you can wrap items onto the cross axis, but you have less explicit control            |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=430.68)  | over the rows of this axis.                                                                         |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=432.84)  | But with CSS Grid, explicit grids are comprised of grid template rows, grid template columns,       |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=438.34)  | and grid template areas.                                                                            |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=440.12)  | And you can use the grid and grid template properties to assign all these in a single               |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=443.94)  | line or break them out.                                                                             |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=445.86)  | To specify each grid line, you can either use a numeric index starting from one or in               |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=450.14)  | brackets give those grid lines names.                                                               |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=452.76)  | So let's take a look at what this looks like broken out.                                            |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=455.02)  | Let's start with grid template rows.                                                                |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=457.22)  | You'll want to set the grid template on the grid parent.                                            |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=459.82)  | That's where you set display grid.                                                                  |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=461.3)   | And to set grid template rows, you'd write something like dot parent.                               |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=465.26)  | And then within the brackets, the curly braces, grid template rows colon 50px 1fr 200 pixels        |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=472.14)  | with a space in between each of these arguments.                                                    |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=474.74)  | This would create three rows that span the block layout.                                            |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=477.3)   | So top to bottom in an English based site.                                                          |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=480.14)  | And that first row would be 50 pixels tall where you can place your header, for example.            |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=484.62)  | The second row would be one fractional unit big, which would be the remaining space since           |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=489.28)  | it's sandwiched between two absolutely sized rows.                                                  |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=492.58)  | And then you'd have the third bottom row with a height of 200 pixels, which you could use           |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=496.18)  | for a footer, for example.                                                                          |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=498.22)  | The placement of the children within that, you can apply with the grid row property.                |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=503.18)  | So if you had an article, you could use grid row two to have it fit into the 1fr sized              |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=508.86)  | second row.                                                                                         |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=509.98)  | If you had a sidebar, you can do dot sidebar with a grid row of one slash span four to              |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=516.06)  | have it fit all the way across the full height of the grid, starting from one and spanning          |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=520.7)   | all the way to the fourth grid line.                                                                |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=522.86)  | We're using grid lines to do that spanning placement.                                               |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=526.66)  | If we wanted a sidebar that started under the header and went to the footer space, we               |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=531.46)  | could write dot sidebar grid row two slash span four.                                               |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=535.54)  | And spanning grid row one slash span three would be the same as placing it into the second          |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=540.02)  | grid row by using grid row colon and number value.                                                  |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=543.36)  | But with that slash, we're identifying that we want this to go between grid lines.                  |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=547.66)  | There's also grid template columns.                                                                 |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=549.78)  | Like rows, you can explicitly set columns.                                                          |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=552.1)   | I already gave an example of this at the top with the repeat keyword, where you can quickly         |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=556.64)  | set a six column evenly sized grid using grid template columns, repeat six comma one fr.            |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=562.82)  | But you can also get even more explicit about it.                                                   |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=566.24)  | Say we wanted a sidebar to be 200 pixels wide on one side and break up the remaining content        |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=571.3)   | into two evenly spaced columns.                                                                     |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=573.9)   | Then we would write grid template columns, 200 pixels space one fr space one fr.                    |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=579.2)   | And you could place the children with grid column by using something like dot logo that             |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=583.88)  | could go in grid column one.                                                                        |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=585.98)  | That sidebar would also go in grid column one.                                                      |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=588.38)  | That article could go in grid column two, or you could have that grid column two slash              |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=592.22)  | span four, which means it would span between the second and third column.                           |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=596.56)  | So instead of setting columns and rows individually, you can use grid template to set them all      |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=601.28)  | together, which is how I prefer writing this sort of grid template because you can visualize        |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=606.64)  | the entire grid in one space.                                                                       |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=608.72)  | And the syntax sounds a bit complex at first, but trust me, when you break it down, it becomes      |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=613.84)  | second nature.                                                                                      |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=614.9)   | So we've also linked you to some great visuals for this section in the show notes.                  |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=618.16)  | If you need a visual to help you understand how this works, I definitely do.                        |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=621.96)  | So for a grid template, you set the rows and then you do slash the columns.                         |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=626.92)  | So it's grid template areas as an optional value as well, space grid template rows and              |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=632.0)   | then slash grid template column values.                                                             |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=633.96)  | And we're going to talk more about grid areas later on in the show and how those work here.         |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=639.32)  | So if you wanted to use a grid template, you could write grid template then colon 50 pixels         |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=643.6)   | space one fr space 200 pixels slash 200 pixels space one fr space one fr.                           |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=650.46)  | And that's the example that I went through above in one big grid template.                          |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=654.1)   | This creates a grid with rows going down of 50 px tall, then one fractional unit and then           |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=659.4)   | a bottom row of 200 pixels.                                                                         |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=661.02)  | And horizontally, we have columns of 200 pixels wide and then two evenly spaced fractional          |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=667.2)   | units with two different columns.                                                                   |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=670.24)  | One really cool thing about CSS grid templates is that you can combine all this with other          |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=674.64)  | aspects of CSS like media queries.                                                                  |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=676.98)  | And a great example and illustration of why grid is so useful comes from the CSS working            |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=681.56)  | group spec, where they show the grid shifting between portrait and landscape orientation            |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=686.44)  | modes for a web game.                                                                               |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=688.58)  | You get to reuse all the same semantic components, but adjust how they look and where they're       |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=692.84)  | placed based on the context of where the user is accessing that application.                        |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=697.34)  | So you can rearrange where the score visually goes and how much space it takes up just by           |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=700.8)   | adjusting the grid templates and columns.                                                           |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=703.48)  | Awesome breakdown.                                                                                  |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=704.48)  | Yep, those template columns are a lot like, you know, looking at traditional print or               |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=707.72)  | looking at like a design file where they've drawn the lines down the page and cut up content        |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=712.94)  | horizontally and vertically.                                                                        |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=714.56)  | And then you mentioned spanning and this ability to say, we'll go into this named line area         |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=719.28)  | and span this much space and in a game.                                                             |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=721.56)  | Yeah, it's great for a HUD heads up display like a HUD, where you can place your things             |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=726.08)  | in the top left and bottom right, you can pre make all the slices, right?                           |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=729.72)  | So you slice them by size, and then you go put items inside of their super powerful aspect          |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=734.66)  | of grid.                                                                                            |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=735.66)  | And now I want to talk about auto.                                                                  |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=737.32)  | So this is implicit track.                                                                          |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=739.76)  | So this is like grid auto rows and grid auto templates.                                             |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=743.28)  | And it turns out that this is implicit and explicit.                                                |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=746.74)  | So it just kind of depends on how you articulate it.                                                |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=748.96)  | And let's go over that.                                                                             |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=749.96)  | So, so an auto for the container and for its children, it's for articulating what happens           |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=754.32)  | if children or the layout don't have an explicit size or placement.                                 |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=758.64)  | It lets grid determine what's best.                                                                 |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=761.14)  | It sets sizes based on content or can repeat infinitely.                                            |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=764.94)  | This lack of explicitness is its feature.                                                           |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=767.6)   | And I find it I use auto layouts more than explicit template layouts.                               |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=771.24)  | Same, although when I was starting, I think I used a lot more template layout.                      |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=774.36)  | So it's like I learned the syntax and learned how these things worked over time.                    |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=777.68)  | Cool.                                                                                               |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=778.68)  | Sounds like you're on the same page there.                                                          |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=779.68)  | So now let's talk about grid auto flow.                                                             |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=782.16)  | Before we kind of get into some of these other ones in grid auto floor is a container directive.    |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=786.3)   | This turns the grid into a one directional layout by setting the flow direction.                    |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=790.54)  | It actually adds columns or rows on demand as children are discovered and need placed.              |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=795.72)  | So where flexbox just kind of does this and creates an axis, grid actually appends more             |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=800.3)   | and more items on to this row until it reaches all your children.                                   |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=804.16)  | This is kind of cool.                                                                               |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=805.3)   | It's also the auto placement algorithm owner that places children if they weren't explicitly        |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=809.96)  | placed into a space that doesn't have an element.                                                   |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=812.62)  | So even if you did a grid template columns and you placed things manually, but there                |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=816.04)  | were a couple that didn't get explicitly placed, like if you didn't hand play something, grid       |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=820.28)  | will go find a place that's healthy for that to be somewhere in the grid.                           |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=823.48)  | It's an auto placement mechanism.                                                                   |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=825.56)  | Grid auto flow accepts single values like row or column.                                            |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=828.44)  | So you can say, hey, go from left to right or go from top to bottom.                                |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=831.36)  | But you can also combo with a new hot keyword called dense and you can pass grid auto flow          |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=836.4)   | colon row dense.                                                                                    |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=837.4)   | So you can combine dense with the direction and it'll pack children into rows allowing              |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=842.46)  | mosaic type effects or masonry types effects as the algorithm will determine which elements         |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=847.26)  | fit into where and pack them super tight.                                                           |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=849.92)  | It's super cool.                                                                                    |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=850.92)  | Flow is really awesome.                                                                             |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=851.92)  | Flow is super cool.                                                                                 |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=852.92)  | I agree.                                                                                            |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=853.92)  | And dense comes in really handy.                                                                    |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=854.92)  | It's kind of neat.                                                                                  |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=855.92)  | Then there's also implicit auto tracks, grid auto rows and grid auto columns.                       |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=860.56)  | And this is a child directive.                                                                      |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=862.0)   | So implicit auto tracks.                                                                            |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=863.74)  | We're telling our children how to behave as opposed to the other one, which we were saying          |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=867.5)   | the direction that I want this container to flow.                                                   |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=870.26)  | So in this case with grid auto rows and grid auto columns, we don't care about how many             |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=875.48)  | columns or rows or what size they should be.                                                        |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=877.6)   | It's almost like the opposite mentality of like a template column in this not caring.               |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=882.18)  | You could reach the limits of repeat.                                                               |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=883.98)  | Like let's say you wanted to repeat 20 and then you're like, well, now it's just kind               |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=887.58)  | of getting silly.                                                                                   |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=888.58)  | I could just do grid auto rows or grid auto columns and set a repeat in there in a single           |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=894.22)  | value.                                                                                              |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=895.22)  | So instead of doing like six, one F R, I could just say grid auto flow this direction and           |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=899.02)  | grid auto row is one F R and I get equally distributed items in there.                              |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=903.6)   | So it's nice when you want to leave things up to the contents inside.                               |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=907.26)  | So note since these are intrinsic, each row or column may be a different size than the              |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=911.02)  | next, but only one will set the size for the siblings.                                              |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=914.08)  | And this is specifically somewhere flexbox kicks butt and grid can be wrong.                        |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=918.66)  | Like a three columns where each are set to auto.                                                    |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=921.32)  | One of those columns will determine the other column size, whereas flexbox will let them            |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=924.6)   | all be individuals.                                                                                 |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=926.12)  | And then if they will float onto a new row, they could still be individually width as               |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=930.22)  | opposed to grid where everything goes on a new row.                                                 |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=932.24)  | It's going to have to fit into a column that came from the parent.                                  |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=934.7)   | So anyway, auto tracks are good for sending an explicit repeat with infinite matches or             |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=939.8)   | letting grid make smart decisions about the track by looking at the intrinsic size of               |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=943.32)  | the children and auto placing columns as wide or as tall as the biggest child.                      |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=948.2)   | So if you set something automatically, the widest one will be the one that will set for             |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=951.8)   | all the rest.                                                                                       |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=952.8)   | And it's like a healthy default here.                                                               |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=954.44)  | Then there's also explicit auto tracks.                                                             |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=956.12)  | So you can use grid auto rows and grid auto columns in an explicit way.                             |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=960.72)  | So this is on a scenario where you like super care and want all rows or columns to get the          |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=964.42)  | same template value without a repeat of infinity or 20 or whatever.                                 |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=970.12)  | So setting an infinitely repeating template value that's on demand is how you could use             |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=974.66)  | grid auto rows and grid auto columns, 200 pixel wide columns forever.                               |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=979.48)  | So it's like this guaranteed easy way to just say, no, I want these size forever.                   |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=983.0)   | I don't even care how many children are in there.                                                   |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=985.52)  | And lastly, there's like a hybrid scenario here, which is and follow me along.                      |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=989.28)  | This is going to use some of the keywords we studied.                                               |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=990.92)  | This is repeat autofit min max.                                                                     |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=993.72)  | So it's repeat open parentheses, autofit comma min max and parentheses.                             |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=999.88)  | And what this is letting you do is it's neither purely implicit or explicit.                        |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1003.74) | It's flexible by employing constraints.                                                             |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1005.88) | This is a constraint based layout.                                                                  |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1007.38) | This is almost like flex grow and flex shrink.                                                      |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1009.84) | It's a little bit like what we were talking about earlier with min content, max content             |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1013.48) | and flexible space.                                                                                 |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1014.84) | Anyway, it's kind of cool because this repeats forever to fill or to fit like an infinite           |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1021.18) | repeat with a goal.                                                                                 |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1022.86) | So it will inquire a children's intrinsic value to inform the size and placement.                   |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1027.06) | And it does so with an overall context, which is kind of nice.                                      |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1029.82) | It's like a grid power there to illustrate its full power.                                          |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1032.84) | Imagine your browser shrunk down to mobile and you're looking at a list of cards.                   |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1036.4)  | The cards are full width in the viewport and they look great.                                       |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1038.96) | You can scroll them up and down.                                                                    |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1040.38) | Now pull your browser window out and watch them stretch wider until they snap to a two              |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1044.02) | columns and then three columns and four columns and five.                                           |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1047.08) | And the cards can infinitely go into however many columns are necessary to fill the space           |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1051.92) | while flexibly adapting.                                                                            |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1053.72) | They never get too small and they never get too big.                                                |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1055.8)  | And this can be done in one CSS grid rule thanks to autofit and min max working together            |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1059.88) | to intelligently fit children based on the constraints that you gave it.                            |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1063.52) | It's so cool.                                                                                       |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1065.16) | Autofit min max.                                                                                    |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1066.16) | It's the jam.                                                                                       |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1067.16) | This is definitely the way that I use grid the most.                                                |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1069.84) | It's using a combination of min max and autofit or autofill based on my needs there.                |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1075.0)  | And then with repeat, this is such a great example.                                                 |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1076.76) | I thought you did a great job breaking down how to create responsive layouts with very              |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1081.36) | few lines of code by using CSS grid.                                                                |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1083.76) | That was awesome.                                                                                   |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1084.76) | Thanks.                                                                                             |
| [18:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1085.76) | So Adam, do you want to talk about gap next?                                                        |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1087.72) | Because gap is pretty cool and we mentioned it in our flexbox episode and how we need               |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1091.56) | it so badly for flexbox.                                                                            |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1093.36) | Oh the sweet, sweet gap property.                                                                   |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1095.64) | Ah, yes, I know.                                                                                    |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1096.96) | I love it so much.                                                                                  |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1097.96) | Yeah, let's chat about it briefly.                                                                  |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1099.34) | It can alternatively be called a gutter or an alley, but I think it's better than those             |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1103.46) | dingy little spaces.                                                                                |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1104.72) | It's not a gutter.                                                                                  |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1105.72) | It's gap.                                                                                           |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1106.72) | It's just beautiful.                                                                                |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1107.72) | Okay, gap is guaranteed space between children, but never in a way that will affect the container's |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1112.76) | perimeter.                                                                                          |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1113.76) | It's like, aka, it's only between children, not between children and the wall.                      |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1118.8)  | So when you use gap in CSS, you're using a shorthand where column gap gets whatever row             |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1123.26) | gap you set.                                                                                        |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1124.4)  | So it's first row, then column.                                                                     |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1126.52) | And if you want to set both as different values, you can just put a space between them.             |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1129.88) | It's dynamic in a way that hand managed margin could never be.                                      |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1133.96) | It's succinct and international, so writing modes and directions can all change in reverse          |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1138.22) | and your gaps will always be perfectly in between your children.                                    |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1141.32) | It's amazing.                                                                                       |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1142.32) | Did I say it's amazing yet?                                                                         |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1143.32) | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1144.32) | Anyways, originally called grid gap, but since it's been spec'd for flexbox now and multi           |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1148.96) | column, it's been renamed or aliased to just gap and gap is supported in all grid supporting        |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1154.56) | browsers right now.                                                                                 |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1155.56) | Use it freely and soon for flex.                                                                    |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1157.92) | Can't wait.                                                                                         |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1158.92) | It's so nice, especially when you can have the parent control all the gap within it instead         |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1163.24) | of having to manage that with the children, which can get really messy.                             |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1166.96) | So OK, now I want to talk about areas and defining spaces and lines by name.                        |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1173.04) | And there are a few different ways to give grids explicitly named grid areas and grid               |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1177.76) | lines.                                                                                              |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1178.8)  | So since we started with lines on the show, let's start with lines in this conversation.            |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1183.8)  | Instead of referring to grid lines by index number, the grid layout algorithm gives you             |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1189.44) | the ability to refer to them by name, which can make it much easier to organize and read            |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1194.8)  | your layout code.                                                                                   |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1196.1)  | The first way to define named lines is right in line with your template.                            |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1200.02) | To name grid lines, you put the name within brackets.                                               |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1203.28) | So these are optional at any point, but you can write these lines where you see fit.                |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1207.88) | So for example, you could have something like grid template columns, 200 pixels, item one           |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1213.16) | start, that's in brackets, and then a space and then one fr and then a space and then               |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1217.44) | in brackets item one end.                                                                           |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1219.32) | So here we're setting this first column grid line as unnamed.                                       |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1224.08) | We're not naming it.                                                                                |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1225.18) | But the second grid line is called item one start and the last one is called item one               |
| [20:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1230.44) | end.                                                                                                |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1231.6)  | So for rows, that could look like grid template rows.                                               |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1234.52) | And then you could give that first line a name.                                                     |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1236.64) | You can call it item one start, give it a value like 100 pixels, space one fr, space                |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1241.2)  | 100 pixels.                                                                                         |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1242.2)  | We're not going to name the lines in the middle.                                                    |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1243.76) | And then naming that last line item one end.                                                        |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1247.06) | So here we're only defining the outermost grid lines for the top and bottom rows.                   |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1252.2)  | Now you can access these lines with grid column item one dash start slash item one dash end         |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1258.68) | instead of grid column one dash two.                                                                |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1261.6)  | And that's the slash, the slash and dash, same character.                                           |
| [21:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1265.96) | You can also specify named areas and you would write these without the brackets, but within         |
| [21:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1271.12) | strings and then a space value or an enter value between those strings of rows of named             |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1277.76) | areas.                                                                                              |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1278.86) | So you can do this by using words like header, sidebar, body and footer.                            |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1283.44) | You can use letters to represent those words like H, S, B and F. And that's a bit more              |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1288.76) | common.                                                                                             |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1289.76) | So you might see a grid template area that looks like grid template areas and then colon            |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1293.44) | and then in quotes, H space, H space, H.                                                            |
| [21:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1297.56) | So that would be three columns, one row of just H, which is like your header named area.            |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1304.2)  | And then maybe you see a new line in your code base and in quotes, this would be S space,           |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1309.54) | B space, B. So that would be another row with the columns being S and B, B, which could             |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1315.64) | represent sidebar and then some body area.                                                          |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1318.56) | And then you could even do another new line and have S, F, F with spaces between and then           |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1324.7)  | in strings in quotes.                                                                               |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1326.76) | And that could be another space for your sidebars.                                                  |
| [22:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1328.72) | That could be a vertical area and then some footer area on that bottom row.                         |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1334.64) | So adding onto this, you can use grid templates to specify named areas and the sizing of your       |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1340.82) | rows and columns together all at the same time.                                                     |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1343.76) | What?                                                                                               |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1344.76) | Yeah, that's the way that the cookie crumbles.                                                      |
| [22:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1346.56) | This is how I usually write with grid because I like seeing it all in the same place.               |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1351.52) | If I need to edit it, I like editing it in one place.                                               |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1354.52) | So what that looks like is this.                                                                    |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1356.44) | So we could have that same grid template area from before in parentheses, we would have             |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1362.02) | within the grid template property quotes, H space, H space, H, and then end quotes.                 |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1367.92) | And then you'd have a space and 50 pixels.                                                          |
| [22:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1370.18) | This would be the height of that row.                                                               |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1372.2)  | So that's setting the height of the row.                                                            |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1374.04) | And then we would enter a new line and we would have in quotes S space, B space, B.                 |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1378.88) | When that quote ends, you would have a space and say this was one fractional unit.                  |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1382.7)  | So that would be the entire main content area of that spacing, which would be the sidebar           |
| [23:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1387.76) | and body fitting in to that layout.                                                                 |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1390.46) | And then you'd have another new line where we'd have S F F in quotes.                               |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1394.82) | And this would be the end of that space bar and then a footer area, which would have a              |
| [23:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1399.04) | height of 200 pixels.                                                                               |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1400.58) | So we have quote S space, F space, F end quote, 200 PX.                                             |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1405.0)  | And then here is where we do the columns.                                                           |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1407.16) | You do a slash and then you set the columns.                                                        |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1410.12) | And here we're just setting the column sizes.                                                       |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1412.12) | So if the columns are 50 PX space, one F R space, one F R, that would allow for us to               |
| [23:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1417.0)  | have a little sidebar area that's 50 pixels wide and then spans that second and third               |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1423.08) | row.                                                                                                |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1424.68) | And then one F R one F R would be the two second units halves of the remaining column               |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1429.8)  | space spaced evenly between each other in that remaining fractional space.                          |
| [23:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1434.0)  | So you can get even crazier with this by mixing in grid line names within these templates,          |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1439.88) | surrounding the quoted areas named by injecting the bracket name syntax.                            |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1444.2)  | But I'm not going to go there because it's going to sound like I'm just jumbling and                |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1447.28) | mumbling at you.                                                                                    |
| [24:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1448.28) | Awesome though.                                                                                     |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1449.28) | However, one of my favorite ways to write grid is using emoji for named areas to make               |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1455.08) | a representative grid.                                                                              |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1456.86) | And this is my favorite technique because it enables you to see an entire grid layout               |
| [24:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1461.28) | represented with single unit spaced values and clear keys representing different areas              |
| [24:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1467.32) | in your grid.                                                                                       |
| [24:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1468.52) | So you could use either letters in a monospace typeface or emoji.                                   |
| [24:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1472.84) | And both of these techniques will help you to see your grid clearly as the white space              |
| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1477.0)  | of the single character makes it obvious how relationships connect and where to place your          |
| [24:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1480.92) | grid elements.                                                                                      |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1482.12) | Then you can place your grids child elements into these grid areas with the grid area property      |
| [24:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1487.24) | and refer to them by name, letter or emoji.                                                         |
| [24:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1489.84) | And another thing to note is that you can still implicitly place items within grid areas            |
| [24:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1493.84) | when using grid auto rows, grid auto columns, and even the very cool grid auto flow, which          |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1499.04) | allows you to specify the density of the flow for the placement algorithm.                          |
| [25:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1502.88) | That's awesome.                                                                                     |
| [25:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1503.88) | So I could be like, hi sidebar, you are now going into the greening with sweat area.                |
| [25:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1509.28) | And then footer, you're going into exploding mind.                                                  |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1512.84) | And then that's super fun.                                                                          |
| [25:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1514.92) | You could call it that if you want to just deal with all the long.                                  |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1518.64) | Oh, just use the word.                                                                              |
| [25:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1519.64) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1520.64) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                           |
| [25:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1521.64) | That's funny.                                                                                       |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1522.64) | Oh, man, that's awesome.                                                                            |
| [25:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1523.64) | So those are all areas and how you can define them and place things inside of them.                 |
| [25:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1528.04) | There's one gotcha inside of here, too, that always gets me, which is if I'm using an area          |
| [25:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1531.96) | and I've defined it like that, anything that I don't tell it where to be, we'll try to              |
| [25:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1535.6)  | find an automatic space.                                                                            |
| [25:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1537.52) | So this is where like auto placement can kind of be a pain because you're like, hey, why            |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1541.8)  | did you put it in the sidebar?                                                                      |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1543.72) | Like the sidebar is supposed to just kind of be empty for everybody anyway.                         |
| [25:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1546.7)  | So there's times where something might be claiming a space or getting put somewhere                 |
| [25:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1549.96) | where you're like, hey, I didn't know.                                                              |
| [25:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1551.28) | You just have to go be more explicit.                                                               |
| [25:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1552.66) | So anyway, there's like an explicit placing sand trap that can happen where everything              |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1557.88) | needs its handheld so much that it turns into this kind of weird new problem.                       |
| [26:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1562.44) | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                   |
| [26:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1563.44) | I'm just rambling now.                                                                              |
| [26:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1564.44) | Let's talk about implicit placing.                                                                  |
| [26:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1565.44) | And so this is like after you define your grid areas, things that weren't placed specifically       |
| [26:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1569.92) | just fall in based on order.                                                                        |
| [26:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1571.68) | And so they'll find an empty space and they'll take those spaces so you can make an area.           |
| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1575.04) | Yeah, it's that sand trap you mentioned.                                                            |
| [26:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1576.8)  | That's the sand trap.                                                                               |
| [26:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1577.8)  | It's like the other side of the sand traps.                                                         |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1578.8)  | Like, what if we're good?                                                                           |
| [26:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1579.8)  | And that also kind of is a bummer, too.                                                             |
| [26:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1581.28) | Someone shows up to your layout and they add something new.                                         |
| [26:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1584.12) | They have to adjust a lot of different stuff because everything was very hand placed.               |
| [26:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1588.32) | So anyway, it's super powerful.                                                                     |
| [26:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1590.2)  | I think that's why it's important to like determine when you're using what grid layout              |
| [26:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1593.84) | algorithms.                                                                                         |
| [26:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1594.84) | Like, I think the auto placement is great for like cards or profiles or something where             |
| [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1598.92) | you have a lot of similar content.                                                                  |
| [26:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1600.5)  | But then when you're applying layout to entire page, it might be better to explicitly layout        |
| [26:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1604.64) | areas where you want certain components to be placed into.                                          |
| [26:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1609.0)  | Totally.                                                                                            |
| [26:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1610.0)  | Great for macro, but bad for micro.                                                                 |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1612.44) | Anyway, okay, cool.                                                                                 |
| [26:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1614.24) | So that was areas.                                                                                  |
| [26:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1615.84) | So let's talk about this is what I like to call like placing and claiming.                          |
| [27:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1619.84) | And I've called it here explicit placing and claiming.                                              |
| [27:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1621.84) | And this is where like defining spaces was the role of the container parent.                        |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1625.46) | But claiming space can be done at the child level.                                                  |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1628.56) | So this is when I was talking at the beginning episode, sometimes I like to think about the         |
| [27:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1631.4)  | container grid.                                                                                     |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1632.5)  | So the grid defining its own space and then the way that it tells and directs its children.         |
| [27:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1637.18) | And placing and claiming are different roles in this.                                               |
| [27:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1640.32) | So placing is something that the parent does.                                                       |
| [27:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1642.04) | And it says you you go here and claiming is something that a child does, like a classroom           |
| [27:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1646.16) | where all the seats are arranged by the teacher.                                                    |
| [27:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1648.18) | And then each student claims their seat either by looking at their assignments that would           |
| [27:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1651.52) | be being placed, or finding one that fits their needs.                                              |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1654.12) | So they could just walk in and wander and find a chair.                                             |
| [27:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1656.46) | And that's them claiming one.                                                                       |
| [27:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1657.94) | So there's a couple different ways to place and claim.                                              |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1660.28) | You can do it by name.                                                                              |
| [27:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1662.12) | So she was describing earlier, we have different ways to name areas, whether it's a line or         |
| [27:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1666.8)  | an area.                                                                                            |
| [27:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1668.14) | And the author has the opportunity to name these.                                                   |
| [27:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1670.58) | And once they're named, they can be claimed.                                                        |
| [27:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1672.52) | Most of the time, I think people assign children to an area, but the child can also claim a         |
| [27:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1676.52) | space by the same names.                                                                            |
| [27:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1678.2)  | So in the current trend where folks like components to own as much as they can, this can be a       |
| [28:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1682.36) | neat trick for a component to own the space that it's claiming in a layout.                         |
| [28:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1686.28) | So the layout can get proclaimed, and then children can go find a spot that they want               |
| [28:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1690.78) | to be in.                                                                                           |
| [28:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1691.78) | There's also spanning.                                                                              |
| [28:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1692.78) | Now this slightly overlaps with named areas in that a named area can span multiple rows             |
| [28:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1696.9)  | or columns.                                                                                         |
| [28:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1698.0)  | But I call it out specifically here as a way to claim space because you can be very specific        |
| [28:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1701.76) | about the row and column you want to claim in the grid, or just specify how many cells              |
| [28:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1706.04) | to claim and expand into.                                                                           |
| [28:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1708.2)  | A parent of a child can claim space this way also.                                                  |
| [28:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1710.7)  | So we have different ways of spanning.                                                              |
| [28:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1711.96) | We have a child saying, I need to span, and we have a parent placing you spanning.                  |
| [28:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1715.32) | We have a parent telling you where to go, and we have a child saying, hey, I want that              |
| [28:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1718.68) | named area.                                                                                         |
| [28:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1719.82) | So those are different ways that you can place and claim inside of these areas.                     |
| [28:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1722.92) | I think that's really interesting.                                                                  |
| [28:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1723.96) | It's a very powerful thing that Grid has.                                                           |
| [28:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1726.0)  | It again reminds me a lot of print where I'm like working on a yearbook, and I get to place         |
| [28:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1730.22) | things inside of this macro layout.                                                                 |
| [28:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1731.88) | Like you were saying, it's great for like a full page.                                              |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1733.78) | It's also great for games, but anyway.                                                              |
| [28:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1735.58) | The last CSS Grid feature that we're going to talk about today that has to do with claiming         |
| [29:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1739.72) | and spacing here is stacking.                                                                       |
| [29:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1741.88) | And stacking, this is my favorite Grid trick, as it gives me similar layout features that           |
| [29:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1745.96) | Position Absolute have, but without the complete removal from Flow.                                 |
| [29:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1750.2)  | So this can be done by assigning multiple children or all of them into the same Grid                |
| [29:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1754.62) | cell.                                                                                               |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1755.62) | So either multiple children are claiming the same space, or the parent is placing multiple          |
| [29:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1759.16) | children in the same space.                                                                         |
| [29:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1760.66) | So imagine we wanted to create a stack of cards.                                                    |
| [29:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1763.0)  | So we're going to define a Grid with one row and one column.                                        |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1766.12) | Seems like a broken way to use Grid, but trust me, follow me along here.                            |
| [29:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1769.24) | So it's got one cell, and then we put all the cards inside of it, and we assign all                 |
| [29:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1773.24) | the children to the first row and to the first column.                                              |
| [29:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1775.92) | Here we go.                                                                                         |
| [29:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1776.92) | We're going to have a stack.                                                                        |
| [29:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1777.92) | So Grid is going to take each of those, put them all into that first cell, and stack them           |
| [29:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1780.36) | based on DOM order.                                                                                 |
| [29:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1781.84) | And all children flow into this allotted space.                                                     |
| [29:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1783.84) | So they flow in where it's like Position Absolute.                                                  |
| [29:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1786.2)  | I have to be like, top, left, bottom, right, width, height, 100, keep your size doing something     |
| [29:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1791.76) | smart.                                                                                              |
| [29:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1792.76) | I don't have to do that here.                                                                       |
| [29:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1793.76) | I just put them into that space.                                                                    |
| [29:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1794.98) | They flow in there, and they'll fill it based on the way that I tell them to behave because         |
| [29:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1798.02) | they've claimed the cell.                                                                           |
| [30:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1799.72) | So anyway, that's all of this is while I'm maintaining a tight layout where things are              |
| [30:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1803.36) | still in Flow.                                                                                      |
| [30:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1804.36) | I have that baggage of Absolute where things get kind of funny and move into places I didn't        |
| [30:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1808.04) | predict.                                                                                            |
| [30:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1809.04) | And I've used this trick for responsive sidebars too, like the classic hamburger menu.              |
| [30:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1812.72) | I can use media queries to either layer and claim the same main content space, or if there's        |
| [30:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1817.04) | enough space, I can tell it to be in a side on a larger viewport.                                   |
| [30:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1821.14) | So I get this really rich stackability that's even responsive, and it's in Flow.                    |
| [30:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1826.72) | I don't think anything can come close to this power of stacking here.                               |
| [30:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1830.08) | Super cool.                                                                                         |
| [30:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1831.08) | And there was one other feature that you liked about stacking.                                      |
| [30:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1832.72) | What was that, Yuna?                                                                                |
| [30:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1833.72) | Yeah, so I've seen a lot of really cool overlapped print-like layouts where people have been        |
| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1838.68) | exploring using Grid for not just app UIs, but also for making creative media layouts,              |
| [30:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1844.56) | for making creative article content.                                                                |
| [30:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1846.72) | And I feel like that's just another great use case for having this capability on the                |
| [30:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ctemNh38ZZIB8eLp9GdxG?&t=1851.08) | web that we didn't have previously.                                                                 |
