| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility                |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=16.92)   | to z-index.                                                                                           |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=17.92)   | Today we're talking about CSS animations.                                                             |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=21.06)   | This is not to be confused with CSS transitions, which only allow for two states, and transition      |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=25.9)    | properties that allow the user to define how the element moves from one state to another.             |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=30.8)    | With CSS animations, a developer creates a set of keyframes and then uses a variety of                |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=36.12)   | animation properties to describe how the element moves through each of the possible keyframes.        |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=41.84)   | It's pretty cool stuff, so let's get started.                                                         |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=44.28)   | In CSS we have at keyframes.                                                                          |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=46.12)   | It's a whole namespace for naming an animation that will hold these different keyframes for           |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=50.84)   | you in a list, and that list will be used and applied to something.                                   |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=54.28)   | And I like to think of keyframes like a timeline, because it's essentially what it is, is you're      |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=58.6)    | saying here's a span of time and I want these markers in between it to have this effect               |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=62.92)   | on stuff.                                                                                             |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=63.92)   | And these markers are keyframes.                                                                      |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=66.02)   | This is what we like to call them.                                                                    |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=67.56)   | And in CSS and JavaScript, we have this term called a keyframe effect.                                |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=71.68)   | And these are the atoms of an animation.                                                              |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=73.24)   | They're like the most granular piece of the recipe of the animation that you can get your             |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=76.64)   | hands on, is keyframe, this keyframe effect.                                                          |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=79.46)   | In each state, like from or to, is an individual keyframe effect.                                     |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=84.36)   | And a CSS animation only requires one of these to work.                                               |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=87.96)   | So like a transition, which only really requires one new position to be, you could make a keyframe    |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=93.28)   | animation that only has one effect, which again specifies one new place to be.                        |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=98.2)    | But a keyframe set can be a whole list.                                                               |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=100.76)  | It can be a timeline of multiple of these keyframes that are affecting something multiple             |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=104.62)  | times in one single timeline.                                                                         |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=106.52)  | Think of holding a keyframe effect in your hand.                                                      |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=108.84)  | This transforms whatever it touches to opacity 10% and a filter to blur five pixels.                  |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=114.64)  | It's an effect waiting to apply.                                                                      |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=116.12)  | So you can think of a keyframe and a keyframe effect like a roll up of these changes that             |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=120.9)   | you want to have at a certain moment in time.                                                         |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=123.16)  | And then a keyframe, all the keyframes, these are a group of keyframe effects.                        |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=127.94)  | So it's almost like we're orchestrating and we're naming these and we're going to create              |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=130.92)  | some meaning about these because we're going to play over these keyframes, applying effects           |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=135.72)  | as they go.                                                                                           |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=137.28)  | So I think that lines us up really well to like start writing some CSS.                               |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=140.6)   | So we have like, if we make a new at keyframe rule in CSS, the first thing that we do is              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=145.82)  | we name it and we can give it a custom string, right?                                                 |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=148.84)  | Who doesn't love custom strings?                                                                      |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=150.08)  | Just name it whatever you want.                                                                       |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=151.56)  | It also has a very official term.                                                                     |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=153.32)  | It's called a user ident.                                                                             |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=155.0)   | And this is just like a robotic way of saying that you can kind of create your own custom             |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=159.28)  | string.                                                                                               |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=160.28)  | But here's something to warn you about when you name your custom keyframe animations and              |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=163.92)  | you're creating these is that they are case sensitive.                                                |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=166.7)   | So if you wanted to, you could have two of them that are named yo-yo and one is uppercase             |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=171.66)  | and one is lowercase.                                                                                 |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=173.02)  | So this is either going to be a bummer for you in your application and cause a bug, or                |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=176.9)   | it can be a feature for your pocket and you can sort of pull this case sensitivity out                |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=181.06)  | when you need it or keep your eye out for it.                                                         |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=183.72)  | So after we named this keyframe animation that we're defining in CSS, we then pass it                 |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=188.08)  | a keyframe block.                                                                                     |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=189.44)  | And this is between two curly brackets and these keyframe blocks are going to be holding              |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=193.76)  | all of our keyframes, all of our keyframe effects.                                                    |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=196.84)  | So this is going to be a combination of a keyframe selector.                                          |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=200.64)  | Think about this as like a moment in time.                                                            |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=202.52)  | So if this keyframe is a timeline, a keyframe selector is saying where in time.                       |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=208.04)  | And then in that moment in time, here's a declaration list.                                           |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=211.38)  | Here's a set of properties that I want to change about this animation at that moment                  |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=214.48)  | of time.                                                                                              |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=215.48)  | So keyframe selectors are either one of two keywords, which are from and to, or they can              |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=220.88)  | be a percentage.                                                                                      |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=222.32)  | And the declaration list is all the stuff between the curlies that come after that.                   |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=225.74)  | So we have curlies inside of curlies here, so it could be a little confusing.                         |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=229.16)  | And I'm just going to recap it really quickly of the keyframe that we're defining at keyframes        |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=233.36)  | with a name curly brackets.                                                                           |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=235.42)  | The first thing we're going to specify in this in between these curly brackets is a                   |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=238.6)   | keyframe selector like two.                                                                           |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=240.94)  | So we'll say two and then we'll open up new curly brackets and inside of there we write               |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=244.52)  | CSS declaration list.                                                                                 |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=245.92)  | So different properties.                                                                              |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=247.3)   | So anyway, maybe that helped you.                                                                     |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=249.26)  | Maybe it didn't.                                                                                      |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=250.26)  | We'll see.                                                                                            |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=251.26)  | And then the keyframe block is also a keyframe effect.                                                |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=253.76)  | They're very, very similar.                                                                           |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=255.12)  | So we have our keyframe selector plus the list of properties that it changes on something.            |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=260.08)  | That's very much like a keyframe effect.                                                              |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=261.48)  | You're holding this thing that's awaiting to change things that it's applied to in time.              |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=265.84)  | So then let's talk about keyframe selectors a little bit more.                                        |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=268.22)  | This is kind of like your typical selector in that it's a comma separated list of percentage          |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=272.76)  | values.                                                                                               |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=273.76)  | So oftentimes people will just put one like 0% and then an open curly and they'll do some             |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=278.0)   | properties and then they'll do like a hundred percent open up some curlies and do a property.         |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=281.24)  | So that keyframe selector is that 0% to that hundred percent.                                         |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=284.48)  | But you could also put a comma there.                                                                 |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=285.84)  | So you could say 0% comma 100% open up curly and curly just like a normal selector and                |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=291.38)  | inside of there say double.                                                                           |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=293.02)  | You can double up.                                                                                    |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=294.02)  | You can stay dry in your styles and say that zero and end are going to be the same different          |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=297.86)  | set of properties and transforms which means you're probably going to throw in a 50% in               |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=302.08)  | there so that halfway through the timeline this thing goes somewhere and then comes back              |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=305.94)  | to home.                                                                                              |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=306.94)  | So it's really a popular way to do that.                                                              |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=308.86)  | It's also really handy for keeping things really dry.                                                 |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=311.42)  | So I think I mentioned that already but notice the part though where it says there's keywords         |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=315.0)   | of like from or to those keywords represent zero and a hundred percent.                               |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=320.16)  | So they're also just kind of nice for readability and I like using them because they look really      |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=324.7)   | nice.                                                                                                 |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=325.7)   | I can say at key frames name something and then say to a new position and it's almost                 |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=330.54)  | like in one little sentence I'm describing this orchestration of properties.                          |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=334.46)  | It's kind of cool.                                                                                    |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=335.46)  | All right and then just a couple of like little side notes as we recap at key frames because          |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=339.9)   | that was kind of a lot is that you can update key frame style rules dynamically from JavaScript       |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=346.1)   | so you can reach into the styles that are on the page and change them with some user                  |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=349.94)  | generated values like where the mouse is or something.                                                |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=352.98)  | And I feel this is really fun and trippy to think about like CSS is defining the start                |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=356.7)   | of an animation and kind of like outlining it and then JavaScript can come in and layer               |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=361.18)  | in these really dynamic runtime aspects to it.                                                        |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=364.44)  | Both working together so we have at key frames is declarative interface for creating animations       |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=369.16)  | and a dynamic one working very much together.                                                         |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=371.74)  | I've also seen people do crazy tricks where they will with JavaScript create the whole                |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=375.26)  | CSS key frame animation and then put it into the style sheet and then let that run so that            |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=380.54)  | the browser almost we're given the instructions and then told to apply the recipe to various          |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=384.24)  | elements can be very cool.                                                                            |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=386.3)   | So at the end of the day for this whole recap after like oh we've got all this key frame              |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=391.06)  | information coming in I want to try to like TLDR make this as succinct as possible and                |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=396.46)  | here it is is at key frames is an array of key frame effects and a key frame selector                 |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=402.26)  | binds the effect with time in terms of percentage so that key frame selector binds time and           |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=409.06)  | all the properties you want to change and you roll it up in something called an at key                |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=412.82)  | frame declaration.                                                                                    |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=414.06)  | And one of my favorite tricks to do with something like this is you can just say at key frames        |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=418.52)  | slide up open bracket from open curly bracket transform translate wide 100 percent and my             |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=425.02)  | curly and my curly and essentially I can apply this key frame animation to something when             |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=429.58)  | I want it to slide up and it's really nice.                                                           |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=432.14)  | CSS is intelligent to fill that all in.                                                               |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=433.76)  | Who okay key frames effects we had this like thing that we want to change a state to then             |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=439.1)   | we have moments in time and now we've orchestrated all these moments in time with all these different |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=443.3)   | effects into something called a key frame and we need to use it right.                                |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=447.26)  | We got to use this somewhere.                                                                         |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=449.06)  | And so key frames are like this mini timeline that we define and in order to apply it we              |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=453.46)  | have to select an element just as we always would and then specify an animation on it                 |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=458.3)   | and we pass the animation name in there our name of our at key frames we made.                        |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=463.38)  | So we're going to dive into the rest of the syntax that happens here but this prop accepts            |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=467.38)  | a lot of really cool stuff.                                                                           |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=469.02)  | You is going to break down a bunch of awesomeness.                                                    |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=470.5)   | I have talked for way too long and yeah let's get started with animation duration.                    |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=475.26)  | So when you select an element you can pass a duration it defaults to zero seconds but                 |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=479.54)  | don't worry that doesn't mean nothing will happen.                                                    |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=481.44)  | Something can still animate over zero seconds but it does use the time type in this.                  |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=486.22)  | So when you specify duration you are using CSS is type of time and in this particular                 |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=490.74)  | case animation duration does not allow a negative value but we will find somewhere later that         |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=495.34)  | negative time is allowed so you can't go back in time with duration.                                  |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=498.18)  | And I thought that was interesting.                                                                   |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=500.1)   | You know can you tell us about animation timing.                                                      |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=501.98)  | I need a sip of coffee or something I went so long.                                                   |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=505.46)  | Yeah you did a great review of key frames.                                                            |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=507.74)  | I definitely like your example of using 50 percent.                                                   |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=510.7)   | I had never really thought about using that alone for animations but it is a fun shorthand.           |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=516.54)  | So animation timing functions are super important when dealing with animations because they           |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=521.66)  | describe how your animation moves.                                                                    |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=524.3)   | They define how the animation moves between one point and another and it uses CSS easing              |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=529.94)  | functions which is actually an entire spec in and of itself.                                          |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=533.62)  | So I'm going to do my best to go through that.                                                        |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=535.9)   | There are a few shorthands for timing functions and those include linear timing which is straight     |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=541.78)  | from start to finish.                                                                                 |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=543.42)  | There's ease which is sort of like a slow ease that has a little bit of an ease in and                |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=549.62)  | more of an ease out.                                                                                  |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=551.38)  | There's ease in and ease out functions and these when you ease in you can think of something          |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=556.94)  | as starting slowly and then going a little bit more quickly.                                          |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=560.18)  | Ease out it would be starting a little bit more quickly and then slowing down at the                  |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=562.88)  | end.                                                                                                  |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=563.88)  | And then there's ease in out which is a bit like an S curve.                                          |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=567.1)   | And when I talk about these S curves and these different curves these are all cubic Bezier            |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=571.94)  | curves.                                                                                               |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=572.94)  | And all these terms like linear, ease, ease in, ease out, ease in out, these are nicknames            |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=576.82)  | for built-in default variables that represent these Bezier curves in the same way that CSS            |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=582.7)   | filters are shorthands for SVG filter effects.                                                        |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=585.62)  | So speaking of the cubic Bezier curve property, the cubic Bezier curve is a function in CSS           |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=592.22)  | that accepts four different numbers.                                                                  |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=594.38)  | The first two numbers are the x and y coordinates of the handle that moves the curve from the         |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=601.74)  | zero zero point.                                                                                      |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=603.7)   | And the second two numbers are the x and y coordinates of the handle that moves that                  |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=608.38)  | curve on the one one point.                                                                           |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=610.54)  | From zero to one is the time and then that is time going horizontally and then vertically             |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=617.86)  | that chart shows the progression.                                                                     |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=620.1)   | So cubic Bezier is progression over time.                                                             |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=623.7)   | There are great dev tools where you can explore this if you have existing animations.                 |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=628.38)  | If you're still trying to get an understanding of animations I would highly recommend going           |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=631.7)   | to cubicbezier.com.                                                                                   |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=633.96)  | It's spelled B-E-Z-I-E-R dot com.                                                                     |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=636.9)   | It's a tool by Leah Verou who makes so many great useful CSS tools and this will help                 |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=641.9)   | you understand how these curves work.                                                                 |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=644.78)  | So when I said something like a linear curve, a linear curve is equivalent to cubic Bezier            |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=650.26)  | zero zero one one and that's because we are not making any adjustments along this curve               |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=656.58)  | for that movement.                                                                                    |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=657.58)  | You have equal movement with progression of the animation over time.                                  |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=662.22)  | You could do an ease in as I mentioned and with ease in we're actually moving the handle              |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=667.54)  | of the zero zero point over to the right so that you have a slower amount of progression              |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=675.42)  | over time.                                                                                            |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=677.14)  | And this way with that point it becomes something like zero point five comma zero comma one           |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=683.32)  | comma one.                                                                                            |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=684.32)  | So that last point is not being moved.                                                                |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=686.68)  | So that just shows you're not moving as quickly over time at the end as you are at the beginning.     |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=692.1)   | Bezier functions can also have negative values and these enable like bouncy or springy effects        |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=697.86)  | because negative values enable you to go backwards in the animation.                                  |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=702.34)  | So you can have something like if you imagine a cartoon where someone is like slowly like             |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=709.22)  | leaning back before they're about to like spring forward then they sort of overextend                 |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=713.92)  | their final resting point and then they stay in that resting point.                                   |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=717.94)  | That is sort of like this S curve but an exaggerated S curve.                                         |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=722.98)  | So ease in out for example is an S curve but ease in out does not have any negative values            |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=728.7)   | or any values that extend outside of this zero to one square.                                         |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=733.42)  | But if you take the handle for that first value and you make it a negative value so                   |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=739.02)  | now your X Y your Y for the first handle is like negative zero point five and maybe your              |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=744.76)  | Y value for the second handle is like one point five so it's outside of the square.                   |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=750.28)  | Now when you play this animation it's going to go backwards in time and overextend the                |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=756.14)  | end before it hits its resting position.                                                              |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=758.48)  | So that is a really cool like fun technique.                                                          |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=762.46)  | It's also pretty good practice to never use a linear ease because in nature there's no                |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=767.82)  | such thing as linear movement over time.                                                              |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=771.42)  | So having some sort of ease makes the animations and transitions feel much more natural on            |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=775.58)  | your page.                                                                                            |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=776.58)  | I find linear has a time and place in UI and I do sometimes use it but with these bouncing            |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=782.06)  | effects this is great for if you have something like a chat bubble popping in or if you have          |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=786.74)  | like an icon coming in like a you have one new message sort of thing or any sort of item              |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=793.4)   | that you want to call attention to.                                                                   |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=796.1)   | Having this kind of exaggerated animation really helps to get that point out.                         |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=800.42)  | Yep good call.                                                                                        |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=801.7)   | I've heard it called timer mapping too.                                                               |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=803.7)   | It's not quite the same thing but the way that you described it it very much reminded                 |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=807.06)  | me of timer mapping which is just a fun concept to think about.                                       |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=810.3)   | But you are you are saying change over time in this way.                                              |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=814.8)   | Linear I use for a lot of my indeterminate animations like if I have a spinner like if                |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=818.1)   | someone hits a button and it's just creates a spinner I'll do something linear there because          |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=821.92)  | since it's indeterminate and I don't know how long until it's done it's nice to not                   |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=826.58)  | try to allude to anything like not to start fast and slow because then it can end really              |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=832.02)  | slow.                                                                                                 |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=833.02)  | Cool awesome tips and shout out to DevTools and cubicbezier.com.                                      |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=836.26)  | I've spent so much time on that site configuring it's just so great so great.                         |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=840.66)  | What a good site.                                                                                     |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=841.66)  | And with both there's a really cool tool that you can actually play your animation and see            |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=844.98)  | how it moves over time in this curve and you really get a sense for how the animation curves          |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=852.52)  | these Bezier curves affect the motion and just even like with this outside of that box                |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=858.78)  | animation curve you can see that it's going back and grabbing some key frames from the                |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=863.1)   | end of that zero to 100% percentage and then moving back past 0% at the end to go back                |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=869.88)  | to the 100% mark.                                                                                     |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=871.26)  | So if you have a continuous animation this works really well if it's less continuous                  |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=875.02)  | you might have some some issues with something like that.                                             |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=877.82)  | Yeah it's like these curves add a ton of style they really bring this like ethos to the               |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=882.46)  | animation and can drastically change it and I find that the more extreme easings that                 |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=887.66)  | I use the more time I add like the more duration I add to an animation.                               |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=892.54)  | So the softer something animates I tend to do less time and then the stronger my curve                |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=897.66)  | like the more exaggerated my curve the more time I tend to add because time looks shorter             |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=903.08)  | when it's really snappy.                                                                              |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=905.5)   | So when something has a ton of like velocity and it just like shoots off like a rocket                |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=909.78)  | it needs more time.                                                                                   |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=910.78)  | Right yeah we need a whole episode on just like tips.                                                 |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=913.46)  | And another fun little hack here is if you want to have multiple cubic Bezier curves                  |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=919.78)  | one way to do that is in your animation key frames actually change what the animation                 |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=926.02)  | timing function is as a property that gets changed over time within the animation.                    |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=931.18)  | So you can adjust any of these properties within the animation and it gets pretty meta                |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=935.22)  | but that's what you can use if you want to adjust the cubic Bezier curve over time since              |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=940.74)  | it's pretty linear from start to finish overall in CSS at this point in time.                         |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=944.82)  | Yeah like if we had an animation of a box let's say it's got like four positions in                   |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=948.42)  | a keyframe animation and we're gonna have it walk to the left kind of very slowly maybe               |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=952.74)  | even very linearly but then we're gonna animate it up and we should have it like jump right           |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=957.46)  | it needs some like initial force and fling in the beginning and then we'll have it float              |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=961.06)  | to the right again very linear and then fall.                                                         |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=963.44)  | And those are good examples of where you would want to change one halfway through the animation       |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=967.18)  | to an ease out and then to an ease in so that these things looked like they had weight or             |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=971.98)  | gravity was sort of impacting their motion.                                                           |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=975.88)  | It's still fun.                                                                                       |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=976.88)  | Anyway okay let's talk about animation iteration count and this is essentially just how many          |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=981.2)   | times does the timeline play the key frames that you specified how many times you want                |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=985.74)  | that to loop around it defaults to one which I think makes sense and it accepts numbers               |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=990.9)   | so those are the only things you can pass in there infinite is a keyword that it accepts              |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=994.62)  | and I use all the time especially for like we were talking earlier about indeterminate                |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=998.42)  | animations where I need something to loop in a circle linear forever and just do that                 |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1003.54) | until the animation is done and I'll tell you something new and for the number you can't              |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1007.46) | pass it any negative values but it otherwise repeats the amount of times that you pass                |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1011.46) | it so you can say you know loop five times and it'll loop five times it's a pretty straightforward    |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1014.9)  | property.                                                                                             |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1015.9)  | Nice and then we also have the animation direction which is not to be confused with forwards          |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1022.3)  | which is a fill mode the animation direction the forward motion I guess is called normal              |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1027.94) | so you have the normal animation direction as the default you also have the reverse animation         |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1033.36) | direction this makes all iterations of the animation play in the reverse direction from               |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1038.46) | the way they're specified in the key frames declaration meaning that if you had zero to               |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1043.82) | a hundred percent this would play it from 100 to zero there's also the alternate direction            |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1049.7)  | this plays every other animation in reverse so animations are indexed from one not from               |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1055.74) | zero which means that for alternate animations the even numbers are played in reverse so              |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1061.54) | the first one is played forward the second one which is an even count is played in reverse            |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1066.22) | and so forth there's also alternate reverse which is similar to alternate in that you                 |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1072.9)  | play every other one differently but it's similar to reverse in that the first iteration              |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1078.1)  | goes from last to first so in this case the first and all odd counts are played in the                |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1085.38) | reverse direction and all even counts are played in the normal direction.                             |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1089.64) | Very cool there's a got you with that I've always wondered why my animations aren't alternating       |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1094.5)  | and it's because I don't have an iteration count set so there's like a relationship there             |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1098.66) | that I always forget that it's like it's iterating one time why isn't it going backwards it's         |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1103.02) | like well.                                                                                            |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1104.02) | I also wanted to add for the cubic bezier stuff the reason why it's progressing backwards             |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1109.1)  | in time is because your curve is sloping downward so that is how you get it to progress backwards     |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1114.86) | since that chart is progression over time so that's why when you have a positive number               |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1118.82) | that's outside the box and in that y value for the second anchor point that's making                  |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1124.38) | a downward slope which is causing that overshooting effect and then the negative number in the        |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1129.18) | y value for that first coordinate direction that's creating this downward slope so anywhere           |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1133.14) | you have a downward slope that's what's causing that progression backwards in the cubic bezier        |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1136.98) | curve.                                                                                                |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1137.98) | Sick this stuff is so cool so cool yeah I love this episode.                                          |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1143.54) | Okay animation delay all right so that was animation direction which is always forward                |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1147.54) | but not the same thing as fill mode forwards I'm really happy you said that because I still           |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1151.5)  | confuse those.                                                                                        |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1153.16) | Animation delay all right how long should we wait until the animation starts you know                 |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1157.46) | it seems pretty reasonable defaults to zero and it can take negative values oh you can                |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1164.38) | go back I didn't know that yeah so the animation delay is the only one that as far as I remember      |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1169.1)  | right now can take a negative time value but it's not like you go back in time it's sort              |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1173.0)  | of like fills so if you go back into the delay like if you negative delay something it will           |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1178.5)  | fill it based on like the overall absolute the needed it's like it will loop for you                  |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1183.46) | in a way and so by going negative zero you head towards the end of the animation and                  |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1189.18) | so some folks use this is like a debugging technique so if you have an animation that's               |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1192.54) | 10 seconds long and you're like really feeling like the first eight seconds are taking a              |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1196.54) | long time for you to get through so you can debug the last two seconds or whatever you                |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1200.14) | can go back in time and start the animation entirely from seconds number eight by just                |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1204.88) | starting the delay negative value so that's pretty cool I didn't know that it's a cool                |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1208.98) | trick Sarah Drasner has a post on it on debugging animations we'll have it in the show notes          |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1213.22) | you can see it there so yeah animation delay pretty much everything you expect from it                |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1217.02) | is normal except it can take a negative value and that would be really cool nice the next             |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1222.22) | value to talk about is animation play state and there are actually two states there is                |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1226.82) | the running state which is default and there is a pause state this allows for you to set              |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1230.9)  | animation state with CSS so for example you could have a running animation and then on                |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1237.18) | a hover or focus interaction set it to be animation play state paused and make an adjustment          |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1243.14) | there or you could have something paused until you interact with it through a hover or focus          |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1248.18) | and play it and I thought that this was really neat I've never actually run into this in              |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1252.82) | my own dev work which I'm surprised about but I realized that I usually don't have animations         |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1257.74) | running on interactive elements like buttons and other links and calls to action but it               |
| [21:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1263.98) | is nice to have just like slowly subtly animating effects I did like a stupid quick demo to           |
| [21:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1270.5)  | try this out myself with a linear gradient as the background of a button and then I'm                 |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1274.72) | adjusting the hue rotation and then when you hover over it that hue rotation stops so I               |
| [21:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1279.66) | just thought this was like a cool idea this isn't the best example but I've seen Raji                 |
| [21:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1284.34) | is one designer that I love and follow his website is like rog.ie and at one point he                 |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1291.16) | had these like blobby gradient buttons that were slow moving and then when you hovered                |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1296.18) | over them they stopped the animation became bigger or something like some kind of animation           |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1300.82) | that combined an animation play state with another type of transition and it was really               |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1306.14) | nice it was a great interaction so animation play state I think is underutilized and super            |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1311.6)  | cool and I don't think people realize that you can adjust the animation play state in                 |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1314.66) | CSS but you can.                                                                                      |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1316.2)  | That is awesome very informative I wonder if there's a performance benefit to using                   |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1320.98) | this like on JavaScript scroll events you'd pause your running animations or something?               |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1326.02) | Yeah you have to add event listeners when you're doing this in JavaScript and yeah I                  |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1330.9)  | don't know if like down to the metal it makes much of a difference for this because it's              |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1334.18) | still an event listener.                                                                              |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1335.18) | Yeah that's true yeah interesting studies to be done there animation play state super                 |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1340.58) | cool then we have animation film mode so this is let's say you want the animation styles              |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1345.7)  | to be visible before or animation plays this is like when you want the animation styles               |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1350.1)  | to be visible before after sometimes you want the animation to affect something from its              |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1354.14) | current place or sometimes you want it to set the current place as the start and then                 |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1357.86) | do the animation so this is essentially your keywords into that by default the value is               |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1361.98) | normal so animation film mode normal means don't affect the styles of the element before              |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1367.7)  | it's begun or after it's finished but maybe you want to change that right maybe you do                |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1372.48) | want the styles at the beginning of the end to stick or to be set and so we have these                |
| [22:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1377.14) | keywords we have backwards which is before the animation and during the animation delay               |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1381.46) | the styles of the initial keyframes you percent are applied to the element so notice the during       |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1386.9)  | the animation delay so you'd like delay something set the styles wait four seconds and then           |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1390.7)  | begin an animation it could be kind of cool it's like a full reset yeah forwards as after             |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1395.3)  | the animation is finished the styles defined in the final keyframe 100% are retained by               |
| [23:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1399.9)  | the element I think this is my most used case it's all animation film mode forwards so that           |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1404.96) | it stays in its resting place and then you have both which is extending animation properties          |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1409.5)  | before and after the animation cool stuff hope that cleared up what those do for somebody             |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1413.96) | out there so you can write all of these in one line using the animation shorthand and                 |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1419.06) | the animation shorthand takes a time the timing function the iteration count animation iteration      |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1424.74) | count animation direction the animation film mode so you would have normal and then you               |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1429.82) | would have forwards the animation play state and then the keyframe name now I always write            |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1435.46) | the keyframe name first but you can actually write it last you have the choice of where               |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1440.22) | to put that whoa yeah I learned that just reading the spec and in the spec it's actually              |
| [24:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1445.1)  | written last but whoa yeah I tend to put it first and I just tried it and works both ways             |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1452.02) | but I feel like the way that I've seen it most commonly is as the first value then the                |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1457.38) | timing then the iteration count then I usually say forwards because like you that's my most           |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1463.02) | used animation film mode and then the easing and the number of animations so you can change           |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1470.58) | some of these around like I think the film mode and the iteration count can be switched               |
| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1476.54) | well some of these can be switched but I tend to write animation like animation name numeric          |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1481.66) | timing and then the other values it reminds me of like background and that there's a bunch            |
| [24:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1488.3)  | of defaults that are optional or there's keywords that are optional in the shorthand and it           |
| [24:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1492.06) | will like fill the initial value for you if you didn't specify it and you can skip it                 |
| [24:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1496.3)  | because it's smart enough to know keywords that it recognizes it's very tricky I agree                |
| [25:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1501.82) | yeah exactly I did note a couple of my favorites here these are just like easy to say one-liner       |
| [25:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1507.12) | animation shorthands that I use all the time and here we go okay so this is some CSS ready            |
| [25:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1512.26) | animation colon reveal space that's the name of my keyframe animation space point five                |
| [25:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1517.82) | seconds space ease dash in space forwards so reveal over half a second with an ease                   |
| [25:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1523.82) | in style type and I'll apply that animation to things that I want to show I have a spin               |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1529.66) | here so this is a keyframe that I'd write a spin which also has some really cool ways                 |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1534.2)  | you can do it with the shorthand in the keyframe syntax for getting something to spin forever         |
| [25:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1539.02) | like I think you can just say to transform rotate 360 degrees and then just set it to                 |
| [25:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1544.78) | this which is animation spin one second linear infinite so it will repeat from zero to 360            |
| [25:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1551.94) | which is a full spin forever over one second until your spinner is not needed anymore you             |
| [25:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1556.66) | can cancel it and this last one is pulse color eight seconds ease infinite and I like things          |
| [26:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1562.06) | that are infinitely pulsing to have an ease or an ease in out because it gives them this              |
| [26:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1566.62) | sort of like heart feeling where they go in out in what is the pulse color a pulse colors             |
| [26:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1573.32) | where I'd be like pulse to brighter blue so go brighter subtle brighter subtle okay so                |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1579.06) | you set the color values that are changing yeah or I'd be rotating it's huge somewhere                |
| [26:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1582.5)  | and then you have one or two here let's talk about those well yeah I was gonna mention                |
| [26:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1586.16) | here rotation because for some reason I use that all the time for just I don't know hovering          |
| [26:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1593.2)  | over links or hovering over small things here and there for some reason I fell in love with           |
| [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1598.82) | CSS filters and I try to use them wherever I can but I use like animation color shift                 |
| [26:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1603.86) | five seconds infinite linear all the time or something like rainbow ties I call it rainbow            |
| [26:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1607.62) | ties me but I just find it like really nice I like animating filters because they are                 |
| [26:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1613.02) | interoperable you can calculate between one value and another and they create such cool               |
| [26:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1618.5)  | effects within CSS so you could animate like blurs and stuff like that too yeah I think               |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1623.54) | they surprise people the most whenever you animate filters people go huh huh it could                 |
| [27:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1628.1)  | do that you're like yeah it's not just for documents you know this is cool it's like                  |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1631.66) | a design tool yeah so another cool way to animate is through steps steps is a type of                 |
| [27:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1638.58) | easing function that divides the input time into a specified number of intervals that                 |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1644.46) | are equal in length so this allows for your animations to not necessarily require movement            |
| [27:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1650.66) | along a linear or curved path when you're talking at the easing or timing and they're                 |
| [27:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1655.66) | defined by a number of steps in a step position so it looks like steps and then in the parentheses    |
| [27:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1662.22) | it would be the number of steps comma the direction and again like the easing Bezier                  |
| [27:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1666.7)  | curves you could think of this as that same like one by one vector that starts at 0 0                 |
| [27:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1671.74) | and ends at 1 1 and having it move along that space except now it's not a fluid curve it's            |
| [27:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1678.78) | going to look like a step graph if you remember those from grade school it was sort of like           |
| [28:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1683.42) | a horizontal movement and then you go straight up from the end of that last point and then            |
| [28:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1689.34) | over again and sometimes they're connected sometimes they're not it doesn't make a                    |
| [28:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1692.66) | difference because with this you're seeing progression over time progression is very                  |
| [28:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1697.06) | static in that it's within the same line but it's moving over time so as an example                   |
| [28:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1702.5)  | you could write animation tick 60 s steps open parentheses 60 comma end close parentheses             |
| [28:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1711.88) | infinite and this would enable you to create an animation like a ticking clock with one               |
| [28:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1716.86) | step for every second sick for 60 seconds so it's just like 60 steps over 60 seconds                  |
| [28:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1723.22) | you have every second a tick where you're moving and you can do a transform rotate you                |
| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1727.94) | can also do it for the minute hand by just changing the animation duration so you'd keep              |
| [28:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1731.58) | the same number of steps but the animation duration would be 3600 instead of 60 for the               |
| [28:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1737.14) | seconds red and the direction values are there's a few options here they're pretty similar            |
| [29:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1742.22) | there's a lot of subtle nuances and how to set up the graph but the first one is end                  |
| [29:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1746.06) | and that is the default and it's also called jump end and this means that the last rise               |
| [29:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1750.52) | occurs as input progress value of one so that's at the very end so it's a hundred percent             |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1755.66) | and the steps are calculated by what you specify so if I put 60 steps here there will be 60           |
| [29:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1760.62) | steps and that end step is going to be the last rise then there's jump start or start                 |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1766.5)  | and this is the first rise occurring at the input progress value of zero there's jump                 |
| [29:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1771.64) | none so here all rises occur within the range of zero to one and the step count actually              |
| [29:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1776.94) | becomes the steps that you specify minus one because it all has to occur within the range             |
| [29:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1781.26) | and not on that range and then for jump both the first rise occurs at input progress value            |
| [29:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1787.46) | of zero and the last rise occurs at input progress value of one and the number of steps               |
| [29:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1792.38) | here actually becomes step specified plus one and there are great charts that sort of                 |
| [29:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1798.84) | describe this this is not in the css animations one spec it's in the css easing spec that             |
| [30:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1805.3)  | is linked within that so if you're looking for more information about bezier curves or                |
| [30:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1810.7)  | step animations check out css easing one we'll have that link in our show notes but it showcases      |
| [30:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1817.1)  | the differences between here so like jump start versus jump end for example with jump                 |
| [30:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1822.46) | end it would look like the first movement on that line is from the zero horizontal line               |
| [30:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1827.86) | whereas jump start the first step it starts at the zero point but the actual horizontal               |
| [30:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1832.94) | line is above it so it's like the closed versus open end of your chart creating that like             |
| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1839.26) | movement spot and it's probably not a great way to learn about it audibly so i would recommend        |
| [30:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1846.42) | checking out the spec just for a little bit more of a visualization about what we're describing       |
| [30:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1850.66) | here yeah and the steps i love the clock example i've seen this a lot too for sprite sheets           |
| [30:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1856.78) | and game engines where they'll pre-bake 200 frames of like a character walking or something           |
| [31:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1863.5)  | and you can feed that into css as key frames and then map them into steps and so now you              |
| [31:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1869.34) | can have like pixel art being executed live on a web page because you're just stepping                |
| [31:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1873.5)  | through a sprite sheet at a speed that it looks like it's animating just like a video                 |
| [31:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1878.26) | game yeah css is so cool i've done that with css before because i've built css games and              |
| [31:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1884.78) | we use step animations to have characters move and it wasn't like a css game that didn't              |
| [31:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1889.9)  | have any javascript it was mostly javascript game engine but we use css to do the visual              |
| [31:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1894.66) | effects including the characters moving around so that's a cool example that you brought              |
| [31:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1899.7)  | up because i was like yeah yeah you're like been there done that hacked it something that's           |
| [31:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1905.14) | really cool that's also coming to browsers is called a scroll timeline scroll timeline                |
| [31:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1909.98) | allows for scroll linked animations which means as you scroll something moves at the                  |
| [31:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1914.34) | same rate as you're scrolling down a web page and within this you have animation timeline             |
| [31:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1919.46) | and this is currently possible in canary with a built-in javascript api and that api is               |
| [32:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1925.18) | going to also work via a polyfill by robert flack who is one of the engineers building                |
| [32:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1930.06) | out this feature set in chrome he built a polyfill that's available on github and you                 |
| [32:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1934.18) | can use it and this will make sure it works in all modern browsers but what's really interesting      |
| [32:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1938.52) | in terms of scroll timeline for this show is that this capability of scroll linked animations         |
| [32:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1943.32) | is coming to css very very soon it's currently under a runtime flag in canary and this is             |
| [32:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1949.14) | super exciting because it is actually really difficult and expensive for the browser to               |
| [32:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1954.24) | do this kind of thing with the polyfill and that's different from scroll triggered animations         |
| [32:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1959.5)  | scroll triggered animations are basically when you scroll to a point on the page an                   |
| [32:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1964.18) | animation will then start it'll be triggered like a waypoint like okay i've made it this              |
| [32:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1967.7)  | far go it like sets off the animation this is a lot easier to compute because you're                  |
| [32:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1972.34) | only waiting for that one event to enter the frame and then you set that movement but with            |
| [32:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1979.04) | scroll timelines you're constantly pulling the scroll position and the viewport position              |
| [33:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1985.8)  | of any element and adjusting the frame and the point in time for the animation so this                |
| [33:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1990.88) | coming natively to browsers is really exciting especially coming to css for me i think that's         |
| [33:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=1995.54) | cool yeah yeah i think it's really cool in addition to an at keyframe for a timing function           |
| [33:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2000.32) | you'd write a at scroll timeline it's like a cool special power so you'd write at scroll              |
| [33:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2007.32) | timeline then you give it a name so if you called it like the progress timeline you would             |
| [33:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2011.56) | then have your curly braces and inside of that you would set a source so you would set                |
| [33:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2016.3)  | source like selector could be the body you would set a start and an end point and this                |
| [33:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2020.7)  | enables a little bit of a threshold for the animation so then when you were to use this               |
| [33:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2026.94) | you still have to write your keyframes so you have your keyframes with all the animations             |
| [33:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2031.14) | in there and then when you were to use it within the element you're applying it to you                |
| [33:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2035.14) | can write the animation timeline and then give that animation timeline name or you can                |
| [34:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2040.8)  | write it at the end of your animation shorthand statement nice so you could write animation           |
| [34:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2045.16) | one second linear forwards progress progress timeline and progress would be the name of               |
| [34:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2050.32) | the animation and then you'd have progress timeline being the name of the scroll timeline             |
| [34:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2054.68) | that's rad so that's cool and this is another example of the name of the animation at the             |
| [34:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2058.7)  | end yeah well it's perfect and it makes more sense now it does here i love you tied that              |
| [34:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2063.82) | all together yeah very nice there's also this idea of thresholds so this enables the animation        |
| [34:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2069.86) | to begin animating when your element is already within the viewport so if you had the threshold       |
| [34:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2076.84) | like 20 to 80 then you would have the element start animating when it's 20 in the viewport            |
| [34:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2083.14) | and when it's at 80 from going outside of the viewport instead of from 0 to 100 so you                |
| [34:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2089.86) | could write something like scroll timeline image in scrollport this would only look for               |
| [34:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2094.48) | this image being within the source in the viewport so you'd have source selector and                  |
| [35:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2100.0)  | you could have the container for that image the start would be the selector of the image              |
| [35:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2105.18) | end and then the end would be the selector for that image start so you're looking for                 |
| [35:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2109.68) | that image to be within the container within the viewport so i don't know i think this                |
| [35:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2114.36) | is super cool and i'm really excited this uses intersection observer underneath the                   |
| [35:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2120.54) | hood yeah so it looks for that and you can't have a negative threshold i think because                |
| [35:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2126.26) | of this but also there's not really a lot of great use cases for having a negative threshold          |
| [35:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2130.3)  | yeah this is amazing in so many ways yeah you mentioned intersection observers this                   |
| [35:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2135.04) | is like a declarative intersection observer yeah yeah i love it and then the other part               |
| [35:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2139.26) | of this that's really interesting this is the first time that css has got a timeline                  |
| [35:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2144.66) | or a tick this is a tick coming from css that's new it's not the tick of your screen refresh          |
| [35:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2152.14) | rate it's the tick of the scroll the scroll is the tick and you get to do it all off the              |
| [35:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2156.62) | main thread like yeah today we have to spin up javascript watch a scroll position we get              |
| [36:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2160.78) | the scroll position after scrolls already happened and then we're setting a new style                 |
| [36:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2163.82) | for something after it's already drawn it's like this ridiculous bummer and now it's all              |
| [36:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2168.46) | declarative and we get to get rid of all that and do it off the main thread it seems like             |
| [36:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2172.58) | a win across the board that's really cool yeah i'm super excited to see more easily                   |
| [36:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2178.34) | built scroll linked animations i think we'll see more because they're less expensive now              |
| [36:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2183.34) | and there's less cognitive overhead even for implementing them yeah so it's a cool time               |
| [36:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2188.1)  | to be a developer i feel like i say this in every episode because there's so many great               |
| [36:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2191.18) | features coming out that same yeah it just feels like css is accelerating at a faster                 |
| [36:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2195.5)  | pace in the past year than it has in the past few years yeah it's really really maturing              |
| [36:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2201.74) | and growing into something new and all of this animation stuff is really fun and exciting             |
| [36:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2206.54) | we're obviously huge fans there's tons of value and to bring to a page into your animation            |
| [36:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2211.86) | or to your ui with this but do be careful about accessibility and making sure that something          |
| [36:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2217.22) | isn't hidden behind a hover or that it requires motion in order to be understood there's lots         |
| [37:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2222.82) | of ways for you to check users preferences in css and to mitigate the amount of motion                |
| [37:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2227.66) | that you're applying if they would prefer reduced motion etc so animation's so cool                   |
| [37:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2233.26) | but try to keep accessibility at the forefront of your mind when you're thinking about it             |
| [37:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2236.44) | so that we can be courteous and inclusive i mean who doesn't want more people enjoying                |
| [37:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2240.88) | the content yeah definitely and i'm glad that you brought that up at the end because animations       |
| [37:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2245.78) | should always be additive as adam mentioned they should never be required and you should              |
| [37:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2251.16) | always make sure that your users can have an experience that does not require those                   |
| [37:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2255.88) | animations if they choose not to so that's a very good point and this has been a bit                  |
| [37:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6IbuahSZJj7e05NmjyhiYW?&t=2261.66) | of a longer show but it is a very big topic so thank you for sticking with us and we hope             |
