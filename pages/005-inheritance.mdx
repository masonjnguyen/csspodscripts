| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=17.36)  | And today we're continuing our conversation in specificity by talking about inheritance.            |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=22.32)  | In episode three, we talked about resolving competing CSS rule sets, specificity, and               |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=27.48)  | in our last episode, episode four, we talked about how the cascade affects which styles             |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=32.3)   | are rendered.                                                                                       |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=33.36)  | In today's show, we'll talk about what happens to a child's element when you apply styles           |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=37.5)   | to their parent element.                                                                            |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=39.14)  | That's inheritance.                                                                                 |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=40.4)   | Like humans, elements can inherit certain values from their parents.                                |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=43.8)   | Well said.                                                                                          |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=44.8)   | Inheritance defines what to do when something needs to be drawn and the browser hasn't been         |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=49.16)  | given a specific value, and which property values are passed down from parents to their             |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=53.96)  | children.                                                                                           |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=55.02)  | It could be considered the other side of the cascade or a supporting default set of values          |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=60.12)  | to fall back on when the cascade comes up empty-handed.                                             |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=63.66)  | Styles you get when you didn't write the code sometimes even.                                       |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=66.6)   | Or when you did write styles to override parents, then it also defines what styles are passed       |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=72.42)  | down to those children.                                                                             |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=73.72)  | So it's cool because it kind of goes both ways.                                                     |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=76.2)   | When we talk about inheritance, we can start at the top.                                            |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=79.12)  | The root, for example, doesn't inherit anything.                                                    |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=82.16)  | That means the inherited value is technically its own initial value.                                |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=85.72)  | But when we go down the line, child elements inherit the computed value of inherited properties     |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=91.12)  | from their parents.                                                                                 |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=92.12)  | Now, that sounds a little bit confusing, but imagine you have a paragraph within a main             |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=96.64)  | element within a body.                                                                              |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=98.8)   | That paragraph element is going to inherit properties like font size and color from its             |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=103.04) | parent, the main tag, which will then inherit properties from its parent, the body tag.             |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=107.8)  | So it goes all the way up the tree.                                                                 |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=109.32) | Yeah, well said.                                                                                    |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=110.56) | An inherited properties list that will shortly divulge grabs their defaults from their parent       |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=115.92) | element through this inheritance.                                                                   |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=118.08) | And all other properties take their initial value.                                                  |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=121.34) | So it's nice to note every single CSS property has an initial value.                                |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=125.82) | And what's an initial value?                                                                        |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=127.92) | Well, it's a property that is not an inherited property.                                            |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=132.56) | And it shows up if the cascade has nothing.                                                         |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=134.6)  | And then the specified value of the property is its initial value.                                  |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=137.6)  | So that's kind of what we're saying, and that the browser will use it when it goes to drop.         |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=141.56) | This process is called defaulting and can be read more about in the spec where they                 |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=145.32) | essentially list every element and all of its initial properties.                                   |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=149.64) | So every element must have every property filled out to be drawn.                                   |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=154.22) | And initial is this default value that you get if nothing else is inherited and the cascade         |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=159.6)  | comes up short.                                                                                     |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=160.6)  | So it's a good time to transition away from initial and towards inheritance.                        |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=164.44) | And Yuna, I see you've got the list here of all the CSS properties that inherit.                    |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=168.16) | You want to break it down?                                                                          |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=169.16) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=170.16) | So there are a lot of CSS properties that inherit.                                                  |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=171.92) | I'm not going to list all of them out, but we'll have a link for you in the show notes              |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=175.4)  | so you could check those out.                                                                       |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=176.94) | But some common properties that inherit are color.                                                  |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=179.72) | You'll see color inheriting from parent to children.                                                |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=182.44) | Cursor will inherit the type of cursor, the directionality of the reading mode.                     |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=187.12) | There's also a lot of font properties that inherit.                                                 |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=189.2)  | You've got font family, font size, font style, font variant, font weight.                           |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=194.84) | And then you have things like letter spacing and word spacing.                                      |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=197.24) | You also have alignment, like text align, text indent, text transform inherits, even                |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=202.56) | quotes inherit and white space.                                                                     |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=204.22) | So when you're doing something like pre-code, you have that white space inheriting in the           |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=208.6)  | code block from pre.                                                                                |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=210.84) | You also have a lot of audio properties inheriting, which I think is super cool because it's made   |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=215.36) | me realize just how powerful CSS is.                                                                |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=217.92) | The fact that you could style audio by writing a couple of lines of CSS.                            |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=222.4)  | The audio properties that inherit are voice family, volume, speak header, speak numeral,            |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=228.2)  | speech rate, and stress.                                                                            |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=230.2)  | There are other things that inherit as well, like line height, list style for lists, visibility     |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=235.68) | inherits.                                                                                           |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=236.68) | And as I mentioned, we'll have a link in the show notes so you could dive deeper into the           |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=239.56) | full range of things that inherit from their parents by default in CSS.                             |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=243.88) | Right?                                                                                              |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=244.88) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=245.88) | This is like a list of things that you get for free.                                                |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=247.84) | Because whether you wanted it or not, but you have control over what's happening here.              |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=251.44) | In fact, let's talk about how you can explicitly inherit because maybe something that you want      |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=255.9)  | to be inherited isn't in this list of the automatic free inheritance.                               |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=260.04) | Tell me more, Adam.                                                                                 |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=261.04) | I've got three keywords for you, Yuna.                                                              |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=263.14) | We have inherit, initial, and unset, which are a little confusing.                                  |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=267.16) | So I hope I can break these down really well for you.                                               |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=269.48) | We have inherit, which causes the element for which it's specified to take the computed             |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=274.04) | value of the property from its parent element.                                                      |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=276.64) | It forces inheritance.                                                                              |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=278.04) | So if you were to say, let's say you wanted a child's gap value to be the same as its               |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=281.76) | parent, you could say gap colon inherit and leverage your design system through inheritance         |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=286.68) | instead of custom properties or something.                                                          |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=288.48) | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=289.48) | Kind of interesting.                                                                                |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=290.48) | You're explicitly turning on inheritance.                                                           |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=293.12) | Then it's worth noting that just like there's an inherit keyword, there's also an initial           |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=296.64) | keyword.                                                                                            |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=297.64) | And this explicitly looks further up the inheritance tree to the initial value set, which is pretty |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=301.76) | much the value that's coming from the spec.                                                         |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=303.72) | And then lastly in this set of fun keywords is unset.                                               |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=306.96) | And the unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if it inherits from              |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=312.48) | its parent and to its initial value if not.                                                         |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=316.24) | So it acts as an either inherit or initial based on the properties that are coming down             |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=321.0)  | in this inheritance.                                                                                |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=322.0)  | It's really cool when you see properties that have logic like this, where they're looking           |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=324.92) | for two potential solutions.                                                                        |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=327.12) | So great explanation of unset, inherit, and initial.                                                |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=331.12) | This can affect your UI in unexpected ways though if you aren't looking out for it.                 |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=335.1)  | For example, with typography, the child inherits a lot of various font properties.                  |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=340.16) | Font family and font size are two examples of inherited font properties.                            |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=344.12) | However, font size is one of those values that can actually affect other unit types.                |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=349.62) | REMs and EMS are two such units that are affected by font size.                                     |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=353.96) | REMs are based on the root M value, so the initial value which defaults to 16 pixels                |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=358.3)  | on the body, and EMS are based on the parent element.                                               |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=361.44) | So if you're styling spacing such as padding in EMS, the padding will increase or decrease          |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=367.06) | based on the parent's font size value.                                                              |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=370.0)  | If you're styling an entire page's spacing with values based on REMs, you can increase              |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=374.38) | or decrease the spacing along with the base font value of that entire page.                         |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=379.16) | So it's pretty cool to see how all of these units start to work together in these scalable          |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=382.6)  | systems.                                                                                            |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=383.6)  | You just need to know what to expect if you're going to be using these.                             |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=387.4)  | I agree.                                                                                            |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=388.4)  | And good call on talking about typography because I feel like inheritance is very well              |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=391.84) | served at the type level.                                                                           |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=393.56) | It'd be really annoying to have to re-declare font colors and font size for everything,             |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=398.2)  | but instead a group identified and organized a set of properties they believe should travel         |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=402.3)  | throughout your page for consistency.                                                               |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=404.92) | We also have keywords to help us opt in or out of inheritance.                                      |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=408.84) | So inheritance is a partner in crime to the cascade, yet I think they're often lumped               |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=413.16) | together for folks in their mental models of CSS, and I hope we were able to kind of                |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=417.4)  | split them apart and elegantly describe their relationship and how they work together.              |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=421.32) | I agree.                                                                                            |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=422.32) | And that's why when we initially prepared the podcast, we had them together in one show.            |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=426.22) | And we thought that there's so much detail and nuance in each of these subjects, the                |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=429.44) | cascade, which is episode four, and inheritance, which is this episode, episode five, that          |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=434.0)  | we split them up.                                                                                   |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=435.0)  | And hopefully that helps you get a stronger understanding of how they each work in unison           |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7q4lpdJOIYaUTNMwjUvRxP?&t=439.0)  | and individually.                                                                                   |
