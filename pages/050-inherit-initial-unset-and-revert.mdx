| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.              |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=17.68)  | Today we're talking about some default CSS keywords and breaking down what they actually             |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=22.16)  | mean.                                                                                                |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=23.16)  | You may have seen initial, inherit, unset, and revert as some frequently enabled keywords            |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=28.76)  | for CSS properties, but what do they do?                                                             |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=31.88)  | We're here to answer that question and provide some examples of where you might use these.           |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=36.4)   | It'll be a shorter episode so you can think of this as a little bite of CSS knowledge                |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=39.8)   | that might explain some of those values you'd likely run into here and there.                        |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=44.08)  | Right here and there we see them it's like if you're in dev tools just like popping up               |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=48.2)   | they just pop up whenever you want to just stroll through valid values.                              |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=51.24)  | I find that these like can be used almost anywhere a value can go so they're like these              |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=55.64)  | super available value that is a little mysterious.                                                   |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=60.96)  | When I use these it's usually to wipe a style clean like a type of like style delete request         |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=66.0)   | or it's to give something inheritance that otherwise wouldn't have it which can be kind              |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=69.46)  | of cool you're like passing down border radius you're like here everyone that's a child continue     |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=74.26)  | having my border radius.                                                                             |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=75.26)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=76.26)  | Thanks.                                                                                              |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=77.26)  | It can seem pretty niche but when you need these things you really need them or they're              |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=80.02)  | really handy when you need them.                                                                     |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=81.48)  | I usually have to look them up to see what they mean because they're weird.                          |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=86.36)  | So if you find yourself in that boat where they're not familiar and you have to go look              |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=89.68)  | them up you're not alone.                                                                            |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=91.04)  | I do it too.                                                                                         |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=92.04)  | But hopefully this episode can be a reference for you as well.                                       |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=94.84)  | And it's worth going over some of the web style layers here too because remember the                 |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=98.34)  | browser has a style sheet the user could have a style sheet the spec has specified default           |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=102.64) | styles for properties and then there's your lonely author styles that show up later.                 |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=106.4)  | And each of the following keywords helps adjust a property towards one of those style origins        |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=111.36) | and gives you the power to grab hold of that inheritance.                                            |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=114.48) | And when we say user agent in this episode we are referring to the browser style sheet               |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=118.68) | the browser is a user agent that provides you styles the website.                                    |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=123.92) | Good call that is critical.                                                                          |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=125.16) | It's also a weird word for browser provided styles the user agent.                                   |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=128.8)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=129.8)  | But because isn't there the user agent string which is the like the browser's name and like          |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=133.52) | a big long string.                                                                                   |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=134.72) | Well user agent is first your browser but it's like an alternative word that I guess                 |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=138.28) | we just talk around it more in spec land and working at browsers.                                    |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=142.8)  | Nice yeah good point.                                                                                |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=143.8)  | All right user.                                                                                      |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=144.8)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=145.8)  | So okay the first value here is inherit and this is essentially saying accept the value              |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=149.28) | from my parent.                                                                                      |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=150.28) | Right.                                                                                               |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=151.28) | Because so these are items that we use at the value level not the property level.                    |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=154.2)  | So you can use it anywhere and it would say accept the value from the parent and you can             |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=157.68) | give it to something that otherwise didn't have it.                                                  |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=159.76) | So like inputs they don't inherit any font properties.                                               |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=162.46) | So that's great for forcing inheritance on an input like because font size and font family           |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=166.94) | don't come through.                                                                                  |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=167.94) | This is like a typical one of the design system.                                                     |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=169.48) | You just go put all your inputs and say font size and or just font family inherit that               |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=173.88) | way the font family inside of there is now inside of your brand.                                     |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=178.04) | Width also doesn't inherit which is another case you may want an element to force inheritance        |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=182.68) | because I'm but you know I'm glad width doesn't inherit by default.                                  |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=185.72) | That would be kind of bizarre.                                                                       |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=187.14) | But along with widths, margins, padding, background and borders these are things that don't inherit. |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=191.38) | And in each spec every property specifies whether or not it inherits.                                |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=194.64) | So if you're curious you can find it all in there.                                                   |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=197.18) | And also knowing all this hopefully makes sense of the requirement of app property for               |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=200.52) | specifying its inheritance or not when you define it.                                                |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=203.8)  | So you have to specify that in an app property and this is wise.                                     |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=206.68) | Every property has it already specified whether it should inherit or not.                            |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=210.18) | So anyway there's a side note here that there's proposals to allow accessing inherited values        |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=213.96) | with a function.                                                                                     |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=215.12) | So a value could be the computed inherited value of a parent property.                               |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=219.56) | Pretty cool.                                                                                         |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=220.56) | I know you know you've got like background color as sort of like a kind of concept in                |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=223.72) | here but think current color but for more stock than color.                                          |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=227.32) | And that's a Leo Verou proposal and it's risky but anyway it would be kind of neat to inherit        |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=232.44) | more things in more areas.                                                                           |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=234.96) | So that would be its goal.                                                                           |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=235.96) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=236.96) | Current color is a great example like if you're also thinking about things that inherit because      |

| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=244.04) | The proposal that I would like is current background color because I think that could                |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=247.28) | be really useful for use in conjunction with color functions.                                        |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=251.64) | So you could do things like shadows and other things are based on a singular color scheme.           |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=255.28) | Go check out the CSS working group issues if you're into that sort of thing and give                 |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=260.38) | it a look over maybe a plus one.                                                                     |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=261.92) | So next we have initial and initial sets a default value for a property based on the                 |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=268.96) | CSS spec default.                                                                                    |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=271.08) | The spec default is used in implementation across all browsers.                                      |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=274.92) | Most everything has a default.                                                                       |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=276.92) | Sometimes that default value is none but it could be any value.                                      |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=281.46) | So for example if you have an initial set to the outline property you have outline colon             |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=286.52) | initial that would actually since it's shorthand mean a few things.                                  |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=290.34) | It would mean outline color is current color which is the variable we just talked about.             |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=294.64) | Outline style is none and outline width is medium.                                                   |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=297.48) | So you're not actually going to see an outline if you see a set outline to initial because           |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=301.2)  | the outline style is not.                                                                            |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=302.96) | For color the default value is black or more precisely it's RGB 000 on chrome.                       |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=308.74) | Color and font family are two values that don't actually have a spec default and instead             |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=313.18) | they point to the user agent default.                                                                |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=315.62) | So the browser's style is there.                                                                     |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=318.16) | For color it's the same across all browsers.                                                         |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=321.16) | It's black.                                                                                          |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=322.16) | I don't know if they all are using RGB but it's black.                                               |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=324.8)  | I think font family is different but I'm not sure.                                                   |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=328.04) | I should have probably checked what they are across browser for the different initial font           |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=332.24) | families.                                                                                            |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=333.24) | I know that it also is device dependent because not all devices serve the same fonts.                |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=338.08) | So this is definitely something to check and maybe something you'd want to have control              |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=342.44) | over or reset as you're building your styles and your design systems.                                |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=346.34) | One thing you could also do is set all to initial.                                                   |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=349.06) | So globally so all is a property.                                                                    |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=351.56) | Initial is a value for that property.                                                                |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=352.96) | You could set this on the body.                                                                      |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=354.6)  | This would reset all of the properties to their original spec default.                               |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=359.26) | So that is something that you could use in resets again for design systems.                          |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=364.1)  | It's also important to note that unlike the inherit value, initial is not supported in               |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=369.86) | IE 11.                                                                                               |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=370.9)  | It is supported in all other modern browsers.                                                        |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=373.68) | The same thing goes for unset and revert.                                                            |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=375.64) | These two are newer than inherit and they are supported in modern browsers but not in                |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=379.96) | IE 11.                                                                                               |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=380.96) | So a thing that you might need to note if you're using them and have specific browser                |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=386.8)  | matrix limits.                                                                                       |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=387.8)  | Good call.                                                                                           |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=388.8)  | It's like any strategy that requires these values.                                                   |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=391.6)  | Yeah, you're not going to be able to support IE 11.                                                  |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=393.6)  | You just have to check.                                                                              |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=394.6)  | Good call.                                                                                           |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=395.6)  | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=396.6)  | I learned something there with initial on outline.                                                   |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=397.6)  | Yeah, because if you set it in a shorthand, it's going to set it to all of them.                     |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=401.08) | Very interesting.                                                                                    |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=402.08) | And yeah, as a reset, if you set initial like all to initial, you are you're resetting and           |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=405.96) | normalizing every browser to the spec as opposed to what they do now, which is they serve their      |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=411.0)  | own style sheet.                                                                                     |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=412.14) | And then sometimes people try to normalize the user agent styles.                                    |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=416.4)  | And so they try to normalize what all the browsers have provided into what interesting.              |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=420.64) | So you can almost like either be additive in your approach for normalization and resetting           |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=425.14) | or you could be subtractive and just sort of...                                                      |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=427.64) | Or both.                                                                                             |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=428.64) | Probably both.                                                                                       |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=429.64) | Or both.                                                                                             |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=430.64) | Interesting.                                                                                         |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=431.64) | Okay, cool.                                                                                          |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=432.64) | Thank you for that.                                                                                  |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=433.64) | That was really great examples.                                                                      |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=434.64) | The next one here is unset.                                                                          |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=435.64) | And so this one's kind of tricky but can be handy and it requires kind of a lot of spec              |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=439.0)  | knowledge to be useful.                                                                              |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=440.58) | But here's what it is.                                                                               |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=441.64) | For inherited properties like font size and color, it behaves as inherit.                            |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=445.52) | So if you have font size colon unset, it's going to behave just like inherit.                        |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=450.2)  | For non-inherited properties like background or margin, it behaves as initial, just as               |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=454.52) | Yunno was describing there.                                                                          |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=455.76) | So on color, this would inherit where if it was on display or float, it would be initial.            |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=460.6)  | It's super hard to memorize which properties inherit by default and which don't, which               |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=464.28) | I think makes this value a little bit hard to wield and hold, but it's there and available           |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=468.52) | if you need it.                                                                                      |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=469.52) | And yeah, no IE 11 support.                                                                          |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=471.28) | And so then the last one here is revert that we've been mentioning again.                            |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=476.1)  | Be careful when you're using it for IE 11, but it's supported in a lot of the modern                 |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=479.24) | browsers.                                                                                            |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=480.24) | The way that revert behaves is for inherited properties like font size and color, it acts            |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=486.88) | as inherit.                                                                                          |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=488.68) | So it'll look to inherit and it accepts the value from the nearest parent, which it set.             |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=494.6)  | For non-inherited properties like width or margin, it means go back to the default value             |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=500.64) | based on the user agent style sheet.                                                                 |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=503.36) | So this is different than something from initial because initial sets everything back to the         |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=507.88) | base spec value.                                                                                     |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=509.84) | Or if that default spec value isn't defined, then it looks at the base user agent style              |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=514.08) | sheet.                                                                                               |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=515.08) | But for revert, it tries to inherit everything from parent first.                                    |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=519.92) | So it'll look to inherit first in properties that don't have a base defined and that do              |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=524.84) | inherit like color.                                                                                  |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=526.68) | It doesn't look to the base user agent style sheet first, it looks to inherit first.                 |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=531.6)  | And for things that don't inherit, it sets it to the base user agent style sheet.                    |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=535.98) | So I do think that unset and revert are pretty nuanced.                                              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=540.0)  | You have to understand the differences between what you're trying to get out of this, whether        |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=544.92) | it's inheriting or setting things to initial spec values.                                            |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=549.04) | They include user agent a little bit more frequently, a little bit more nuanced here,                |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=555.44) | but definitely useful if this is what you're trying to do.                                           |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=559.0)  | If you're trying to like by default inherit what you can and then get the user agent style           |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=563.12) | sheet.                                                                                               |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=564.12) | So this seems like we have too many, right?                                                          |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=565.58) | This is four.                                                                                        |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=566.58) | We just went over four values that sort of all do a different kind of value reset or                 |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=570.96) | a value finding.                                                                                     |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=572.42) | It finds a value to replace in there.                                                                |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=574.76) | Chris Coyier and PPK each have one more that they want.                                              |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=578.84) | So if they had their way, we would have six.                                                         |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=581.74) | And so if you're interested at how Chris Coyier and PPK both think that these four aren't            |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=587.24) | enough, go check out their thoughts on these things.                                                 |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=591.52) | And you might, I don't know, I think it's interesting that they think there's still                  |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=594.76) | some missing values in terms of, I think one is called cascade and I don't remember what             |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=599.68) | the other one's called, but yeah, kind of interesting.                                               |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=601.52) | Yeah.                                                                                                |

| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=605.08) | I think that they're also very interesting and very timely for when we had this podcast              |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=610.08) | planned, which is awesome.                                                                           |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=611.8)  | So we have come to the end of today's show.                                                          |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=613.96) | This was just a quick recap of some of these CSS keywords that you likely see floating               |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=618.44) | around.                                                                                              |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=619.44) | They can be really useful, especially in design systems and libraries and when used as stack         |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/731Ql5cmL5n3gPvx7IQth7?&t=624.72) | style resets across your applications.                                                               |
