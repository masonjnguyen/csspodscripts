| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS Podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=18.14)  | Since we last talked about color in episode 6 and the future of web color in episode 7,            |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=22.76)  | there's been a few changes to the next level of color specs and we want to update you all          |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=27.0)   | on where they're at.                                                                               |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=28.8)   | So we'll talk about expanded color spaces and color functions in this episode.                     |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=33.72)  | Some you can try out in tech previews, some are more experimental, but all of them are             |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=37.92)  | super exciting for the web platform.                                                               |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=39.76)  | Yes, those episodes were two years ago, which we all know in tech years is like a decade.          |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=45.24)  | And we don't want you to be left behind in the 5% lightness.                                       |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=47.92)  | Get the joke?                                                                                      |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=48.92)  | It's a CSS joke.                                                                                   |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=49.92)  | Anyway, it's totally worth a review if it's been a minute for you.                                 |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=55.4)   | And go check those out.                                                                            |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=56.4)   | They're all about color perception and syntax.                                                     |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=58.76)  | So let's start with what we shared in those episodes that has been changed.                        |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=63.0)   | What did we get wrong or share too early, Yuna?                                                    |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=65.52)  | Well, two new color spaces have been added since.                                                  |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=68.52)  | There's now OK Lab and OK LCH.                                                                     |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=71.88)  | These color spaces are pretty much 95% the same as Lab and LCH, but they've been created           |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=78.66)  | with special adjustments to the blue spaces so that gradients and interpolations inside            |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=84.16)  | these spaces stay within the perceptual hue better.                                                |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=88.76)  | Or one could say that LCH and Lab poorly transition from blue to white.                            |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=93.28)  | They kind of go purple in the middle.                                                              |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=95.16)  | So these new color functions, OK Lab and OK LCH, they don't.                                       |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=99.0)   | They transition a bit more true to perceptual color from blue to white.                            |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=104.12) | Yep, excellent recap.                                                                              |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=106.4)  | Gray has also been removed.                                                                        |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=107.84) | So there was a function called gray, G-R-A-Y.                                                      |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=110.0)  | You pass a percentage inside of there, and it was essentially a convenience function               |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=114.16) | for accessing grays from a perceptually linear space like LCH.                                     |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=119.72) | And the way forward is just use LCH, like LCH, open parentheses, 50%.                              |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=125.48) | I feel like perceptual is one of those words, like specificity, that's hard to say.                |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=130.84) | Perceptually linear.                                                                               |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=131.84) | What reminds me of Point Pleasant Police Department.                                               |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=134.12) | Have you seen that skit?                                                                           |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=135.68) | No.                                                                                                |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=136.68) | Oh, they just exclusively.                                                                         |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=137.68) | Send it to me after.                                                                               |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=138.68) | I will.                                                                                            |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=139.68) | They're talking all words that start with the letter P, and they do it while they're               |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=142.0)  | eating food, and they're just like spitting on each other while they talk about things.            |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=146.12) | It's very funny.                                                                                   |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=147.12) | It's an SNL skit.                                                                                  |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=148.12) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=149.12) | Worth the time.                                                                                    |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=150.12) | OK, well, let's talk about color manipulation now.                                                 |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=151.8)  | There's been some stabilization around color functions and color manipulation that's really        |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=155.46) | exciting and can even be tried in browsers, like you know saying, with some experimental           |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=158.96) | flags turned on or poly filled with preprocessors.                                                 |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=162.36) | What's the first one you want to talk about here, Yuna?                                            |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=164.4)  | Well, let's talk about color mix.                                                                  |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=165.92) | Color mix is awesome for mixing colors together, just like it sounds.                              |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=169.48) | You can mix in black and white if you like, or you can mix two colors together like hot            |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=174.68) | pink and Rebecca purple.                                                                           |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=176.6)  | It works as simply as using the color mix function and then in parentheses stating the             |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=182.12) | colors that you want to mix.                                                                       |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=183.94) | So color mix, it's color dash mix and then in parentheses white comma red would equally            |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=189.64) | mix white and red together in the LCH color space.                                                 |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=193.68) | It could also be written explicitly without shorthands or default parameters, clearly              |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=198.28) | articulating the color space that the function should keep 50 percent of the white in and          |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=202.88) | 50 percent of the red in the mix.                                                                  |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=204.86) | So you could write color mix and then in parentheses in LCH comma white 50 percent comma red space |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=213.44) | 50 percent and then close parentheses.                                                             |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=215.64) | So you could also state the color space and you have flexibility there with the available          |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=220.4)  | color spaces.                                                                                      |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=221.4)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=222.4)  | And color mix can also scale up to complex cases like mixing colors with alpha, mixing             |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=226.44) | colors in custom color spaces and much more.                                                       |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=229.88) | And as a final syntax tip with this color mix function, we've mentioned the percentages            |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=233.34) | that can be passed with each color.                                                                |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=235.46) | This percentage says how dominant that color should be while mixing or rather how much             |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=239.32) | of this color should make its way into the final result.                                           |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=242.2)  | And you don't have to specify the percentage for both colors.                                      |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=244.64) | If you omit the percentage for one of the colors, it'll automatically be assigned to               |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=248.24) | the remainder of the weight.                                                                       |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=249.86) | So here's an example of that with color dash mix open up parentheses white space 25 percent        |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=255.16) | comma red.                                                                                         |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=256.76) | Now the mix result is more red than white because we said that white is 20 percent of              |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=260.32) | the mix.                                                                                           |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=261.32) | Red is then assigned 75 percent to total the two mixed colors to 100 percent.                      |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=265.66) | So here's another example kind of reversing it.                                                    |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=267.36) | We have color dash mix open up parentheses white comma red space 25 percent.                       |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=273.12) | Now the mixed result is more white as it's now 75 percent of the mix.                              |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=277.84) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=278.84) | So there's also a function called color adjust.                                                    |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=281.2)  | And if you've been reading early versions of the spec, it's worth noting that this function        |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=285.6)  | color adjust has been removed.                                                                     |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=287.76) | However there is the relative color syntax that has all of the same features and even              |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=292.96) | more.                                                                                              |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=293.96) | So the relative color syntax isn't a function but it is a way to create a color from another       |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=298.6)  | one which when it comes down to it is pretty similar to adjusting colors.                          |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=303.52) | So the basic syntax is say you wanted to work in the lch color space.                              |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=308.64) | You can say lch and then in parentheses from space red space l space c space h.                    |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=315.32) | This creates a new color in the lch space from red and returns the l c and h values                |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=321.84) | for use in calc if you wanted to make any adjustments.                                             |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=325.0)  | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=326.0)  | So here's a relative change to the lightness of red using the relative color syntax.               |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=330.52) | We say lch open up parentheses from space red space calc l minus 20 percent space c space          |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=338.52) | h.                                                                                                 |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=339.52) | So this returns a new red color that's 20 percent lighter where the lightness adjustment           |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=343.84) | was done in the perceptually linear space of lch.                                                  |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=347.88) | So it's relative change because we took the current lightness which is stashed in that             |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=351.28) | l value and subtracted 20 percent using a calc.                                                    |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=354.8)  | So here's another example though that's an absolute change where we're not going to use            |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=358.08) | calc we're just going to change one of the channel values.                                         |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=361.24) | So I'll say lch open parentheses from space red space 20 percent space c space h.                  |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=368.0)  | This creates a new dark red color by setting lightness to 20 percent.                              |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=371.96) | It's not a calculation.                                                                            |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=373.52) | It's just a reassignment which is what makes this an absolute change to the color and not          |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=377.44) | a relative one.                                                                                    |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=378.44) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=379.44) | So speaking of reassignment so far we've only worked inside of lch but there is a classic          |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=384.48) | use case when working with color in css and that is somebody wanting to add alpha transparency     |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=390.24) | to an existing color value.                                                                        |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=392.44) | You might have a color value in your theme colors and now you want to add some opacity             |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=396.56) | to it and not have to use the opacity property for the entire element because that doesn't         |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=401.8)  | always make sense.                                                                                 |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=402.8)  | You often want it just on the color value.                                                         |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=405.32) | So you can use this relative color syntax to do that and let's do an rgb example since             |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=410.56) | we've been working lch.                                                                            |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=411.88) | Say you want to do rgb you would have rgb and then in parentheses from space red that's            |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=417.0)  | the color that you're working in and then you would specify rg and b with spaces in                |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=421.44) | between and then you would add a slash and 50 percent and then close parentheses.                  |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=426.54) | So this would create a new 50 percent transparent red from that hex color and it creates a new     |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=433.52) | color that gives an initially opaque value this initially opaque red color some transparency       |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=439.88) | to that 50 red.                                                                                    |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=441.28) | So that use case is solved by using this syntax.                                                   |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=444.84) | Yep I cannot wait for that.                                                                        |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=446.64) | That's gonna be really nice because it seems like we always get opaque colors from a design        |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=449.86) | system and there's always these edge cases where you're like oh but I want it 25 percent           |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=453.52) | here maybe I want it in a box shadow and boom relative color syntax for the win.                   |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=458.36) | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=459.36) | There is so much more to talk about in this syntax but here's another fun use case before          |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=464.1)  | we go.                                                                                             |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=465.1)  | I'm gonna work in lch again so I'll say lch open parentheses from space blue.                      |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=469.86) | So remember where we're saying blue here can be any color in any format.                           |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=473.48) | The starting function that we call lch is the type of color that we're going to return             |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=477.78) | but we can work with any color inside of there so we can pull a color from those.                  |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=481.52) | Anyway so I want to say lch from blue calc l plus 60 percent space c space h.                      |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=489.04) | So this creates a new light blue color that's 60 percent lighter where 60 percent is a healthy     |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=494.44) | average amount of perceptual lightness change to pass wikid2.                                      |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=498.48) | So you can use this like a pseudo color contrast function.                                         |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=501.64) | Speaking of which, Yuna tell us about the color contrast function.                                 |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=506.6)  | Someone say color contrast?                                                                        |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=509.64) | The color contrast function was in the color level 5 spec but due to some concerns with            |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=514.6)  | the wikag2 algorithm and changes it has been moved to color level 6.                               |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=520.16) | So for now since it's not stable and Adam's been working on a couple of adjustments to             |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=525.52) | it we'll just share with you the high level features that this is going for so you can             |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=529.84) | know that it's on the horizon.                                                                     |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=531.78) | In fact you can try out an early version of this function in Safari tech preview by enabling       |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=537.2)  | flags in Safari TP and Adam's made a few demos with it which we will include as links in           |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=542.64) | the show notes.                                                                                    |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=543.64) | So color contrast wants to help authors meet accessibility criteria without having to analyze      |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=549.4)  | every single color decision themselves.                                                            |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=551.92) | It does that for you.                                                                              |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=554.04) | And this could be around text legibility like ensuring double A or triple A contrast ratios        |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=558.98) | are met and there are even more contrast algorithms that it could potentially adapt to.            |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=564.96) | But it's also helping interfaces adapt to user preferences or just create color schemes            |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=569.4)  | with appropriate contrast more easily.                                                             |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=571.96) | And usage will look something like this.                                                           |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=575.2)  | This isn't the final syntax but it's just the general intent.                                      |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=578.6)  | So it might look like contrast color or color contrast we've been discussing what the name         |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=583.36) | would be.                                                                                          |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=584.36) | So say it's contrast color and then in parentheses you would have a color value versus a color     |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=589.92) | list.                                                                                              |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=590.92) | So that might be white versus blue comma dark blue comma light blue.                               |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=595.68) | And now you're specifying what you're contrasting against.                                         |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=599.72) | So that first color would be the parameter and it could be like a background depending             |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=603.6)  | on where you're using this you might be using it on text and if you use it on a background         |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=607.64) | you state the color value and then the color list.                                                 |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=610.76) | It is also in the spec right now an option to include the contrast ratio.                          |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=616.32) | So you could set the actual ratio that you want to contrast it by.                                 |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=620.88) | That might change.                                                                                 |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=621.88) | It might be auto values.                                                                           |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=622.88) | Again this is very much a work in progress.                                                        |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=625.44) | A lot of discussion about it right now.                                                            |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=627.4)  | But the intent is for the browser to really give you the user an easier way to set contrast        |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=634.2)  | ratios to set accessible colors and to build your interfaces to be accessible by default.          |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=639.88) | Yeah and it has.                                                                                   |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=641.2)  | It's gone through a few phases and I think it's super cool and I can't wait for it but             |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=644.36) | I appreciate the amount of churn that's happening on it right now.                                 |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=647.92) | But it has a couple of features to figure out before it's ready to prototype with again            |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=651.04) | and one feature is there's a WCAG 3 color contrast requirement that's getting worked               |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=655.26) | on maybe you've heard of it before.                                                                |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=657.32) | So there's competing more modern methods for what is color contrast.                               |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=662.04) | For example WCAG 2 doesn't do anything with opacity.                                               |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=665.02) | You can pass in and compare two colors that are 0.1 opaque so they're like hardly visible          |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=671.56) | colors and the color contrast of WCAG 2.0 just compares those colors as if they had                |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=675.84) | no opacity.                                                                                        |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=676.84) | So it's not necessarily trustworthy in those scenarios and it's unlikely but maybe this            |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=682.44) | function could work with gradients too.                                                            |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=684.1)  | Like if you pass a gradient as the background color could it find what color passes the            |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=687.56) | target ratio on top of that gradient?                                                              |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=689.84) | So we have like contrast strategies, we have opacity and we have gradients and probably            |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=695.5)  | a couple other little things in there to work out before this function really is hardened          |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=699.52) | and ready for production.                                                                          |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=701.28) | Yeah that was a lot of color talk but thank you for sticking with us.                              |

| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lsScWaCWZK1PA7xtPymH5?&t=713.0)  | really excited about it.                                                                           |
