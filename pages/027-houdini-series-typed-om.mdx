| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.          |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=16.96)   | Today we're continuing our CSS Houdini series and talking about the typed object model,           |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=23.16)   | which we may refer to in this episode as the typed OM.                                            |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=26.6)    | The typed OM converts CSS from how browsers would previously understand it as simple strings      |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=32.12)   | into typed JavaScript representations.                                                            |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=35.0)    | This allows for some major performance wins as the browser understands CSS in a more structured   |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=40.16)   | way, and no longer needs to tokenize it all from scratch.                                         |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=43.32)   | Yes, you may be familiar with the CSS OM, but this is the typed OM and both of them               |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=48.3)    | are trying to represent CSS in different ways and the typed OM, well, it wants to type things.    |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=52.96)   | And it wants to make it easier for developers to read and analyze CSS.                            |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=57.44)   | You'll get better performance from these APIs because there's no relay out on property accessing. |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=62.56)   | So that's huge.                                                                                   |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=63.56)   | If anyone knows, like if you're running a loop that's operating all the time and you're           |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=67.0)    | accessing values so that you can change them.                                                     |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=69.48)   | Well, if you use typed OM, you will no longer invoke all of the expensive things in the           |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=74.0)    | browser.                                                                                          |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=75.0)    | It's huge.                                                                                        |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=76.0)    | I mean, if you've got a request animation frame loop, you get higher precision and better         |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=79.16)   | animation.                                                                                        |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=80.16)   | Why wouldn't you do it?                                                                           |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=81.16)   | You also get error handling.                                                                      |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=82.62)   | There's types.                                                                                    |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=83.62)   | So if you try to put a pixel value somewhere where pixels aren't allowed, you're going            |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=86.48)   | to get an error.                                                                                  |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=87.64)   | There's parse methods so you can pass a raw string and get a robust object back.                  |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=92.54)   | There's math functions for conversion, clamping, and et cetera.                                   |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=95.8)    | It's great for creating meaningful, error-free CSS.                                               |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=99.42)   | You can create CSS like this.                                                                     |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=100.96)  | You say CSS.px open parenthesis 20 end parenthesis.                                               |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=105.96)  | That's 20 pixel value.                                                                            |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=107.32)  | You'll get back a typed object that you can request and use that in some other way.               |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=111.4)   | Because what's nice is you can take that value back and say dot add 10.                           |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=114.96)  | So now it's 30 pixels and you didn't have to do any string manipulation.                          |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=118.04)  | You just called dot add on this rich object that you got back.                                    |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=120.88)  | And we'll get into that more.                                                                     |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=121.88)  | That is so nice.                                                                                  |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=123.36)  | Right?                                                                                            |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=124.36)  | It's like typed OM is a killer typed crud API to CSS.                                             |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=127.56)  | So you can create, read, update, and delete CSS off of elements really easily in a nice           |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=133.1)   | typed fashion.                                                                                    |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=134.2)   | It adds even more functional programming concepts too.                                            |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=137.16)  | Did you hear that it was like dot pixel and you call a function?                                  |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=139.8)   | You can put functions inside of functions and you know, I like that.                              |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=142.96)  | And these maps that you get back are also iterables.                                              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=145.52)  | So what you're getting is not just an array, you're getting a map back.                           |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=149.0)   | And these are things that you could iterate through using modern ES6.                             |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=152.86)  | Who wouldn't want to do that?                                                                     |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=154.04)  | So the way you can check to see if this is in your browser today is you can say if open           |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=157.68)  | parenthesis window dot CSS and CSS dot number.                                                    |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=161.42)  | So that's checking to see if the CSS window object is present and if it has a number property     |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=165.96)  | on it.                                                                                            |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=166.96)  | Currently, it's only supported in the Safari tech preview and Chromium, but I would tell          |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=170.72)  | you to go give this a shot.                                                                       |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=172.04)  | So you know, can you tell us how we get all these benefits by introducing the two new             |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=175.74)  | style accessor functions?                                                                         |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=177.32)  | What are these two new APIs we got?                                                               |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=178.88)  | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=179.88)  | So as you mentioned, converting CSS object model value strings into something more meaningful     |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=184.0)   | and semantic and vice versa has a significant performance overhead.                               |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=188.76)  | Using dot style, like element dot style dot color is really limited.                              |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=192.8)   | And going through window dot get computed style is also not as efficient as querying              |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=197.2)   | the element directly.                                                                             |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=198.2)   | Amen.                                                                                             |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=199.2)   | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=200.2)   | So the typed OM API, you can use computed style map and attribute style map directly              |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=203.68)  | on any element and get and set its CSS values.                                                    |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=207.36)  | Now the first one that we have here is computed style map.                                        |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=210.64)  | And this is a function.                                                                           |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=211.64)  | So you have to keep the parentheses when you're using it and you can use it on any element.       |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=216.02)  | And this is used for parsing computed styles.                                                     |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=218.24)  | So you can do element dot computed style map dot get, which would return style values.            |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=225.16)  | And an example of that would be if you had a element dot computed style map dot get font          |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=230.32)  | size and you're using two REMS for the font size.                                                 |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=233.52)  | The idea is that you would get a CSS unit value and that unit value would have a property         |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=239.0)   | value pair of value and two and unit and REM.                                                     |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=242.46)  | So it would be an object that has meaning for what this font size is.                             |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=247.28)  | Now a difference between window dot get computed style and element dot computed style map,        |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=252.8)   | this newer property, is that window dot get computed style returns the resolved values,           |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=257.92)  | which would be 32 PX instead of two REM, whereas element dot computed style map theoretically     |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=264.16)  | returns the computed values.                                                                      |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=266.48)  | Now I say theoretically because this is what the spec says and this is the intention of           |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=271.32)  | the typed OM.                                                                                     |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=272.66)  | But as we previously mentioned, this is an experimental technology.                               |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=276.6)   | So there are a lot of caveats and gotchas if you are currently playing and experimenting          |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=281.2)   | with this.                                                                                        |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=282.34)  | So right now I believe that you still get 32 pixels, but the idea is that you get two             |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=287.84)  | REM as a value and a unit separately as a CSS unit value.                                         |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=292.56)  | So another example is that the typed OM would return a percentage value.                          |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=296.46)  | So if you had a width of 50%, using the typed OM would show you that you have a width type        |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=302.46)  | with a value of 50%.                                                                              |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=304.12)  | The unit is percentage and the value is 50.                                                       |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=308.2)   | Whereas the CSS object model currently, if you use window dot get computed style map,             |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=312.92)  | would resolve to a fixed length.                                                                  |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=314.92)  | So whether that's like 216 pixels or whatever the computed style is at that given time.           |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=320.7)   | And this is a pretty key difference.                                                              |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=323.1)   | Now there's also attribute style map, and this one's not a function, it gets you a map.           |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=328.48)  | This is used for parsing and modifying inline styles directly.                                    |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=332.34)  | So there are functions on this, there's the dot get function, which lets you get inline           |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=336.6)   | values.                                                                                           |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=337.6)   | And this one does work as expected.                                                               |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=338.68)  | So if you had two REMs, you would get the value two unit of REM when you queried for              |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=345.04)  | the font size.                                                                                    |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=346.4)   | What that looks like is element dot attribute style map dot get font size.                        |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=351.24)  | And that's in quotes inside of the parentheses.                                                   |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=353.8)   | There's also set where you can set these values.                                                  |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=357.08)  | So you could do attribute style map dot set, and then give it a font size and three REM           |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=361.48)  | if you wanted both those are in strings, and they're comma separated.                             |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=364.96)  | There is the clear function which removes all inline declarations, and it'll essentially          |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=368.86)  | reset it.                                                                                         |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=369.86)  | There's append to add a new CSS declaration.                                                      |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=372.72)  | And there's delete where there's append so that you could delete any given declaration.           |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=377.8)   | And this also has other map features because it's a map.                                          |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=380.44)  | So another feature has is has.                                                                    |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=383.2)   | So you could do element dot attribute style map dot has, and then put a string in there           |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=387.76)  | like opacity and it'll return true or false if it has an opacity value.                           |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=391.8)   | So pretty neat.                                                                                   |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=393.3)   | Super neat.                                                                                       |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=394.3)   | Okay, so we have these two new ways to access CSS.                                                |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=397.46)  | We had computed style map, which you have to call with a parentheses.                             |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=401.36)  | Both of these you use on an element.                                                              |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=403.72)  | And one returns computed values, which are different than resolved values.                        |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=408.36)  | And then the other attribute dot style map that returns inline styles that have been              |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=412.44)  | written.                                                                                          |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=413.44)  | So the attribute style map is like this quick place to go and just interact awesomely with        |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=417.08)  | your inline styles.                                                                               |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=418.9)   | Computed style map is a way for you to access the computed values.                                |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=422.56)  | Okay, this is really cool.                                                                        |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=423.86)  | So and then these things as we call them and access and use get and set and clear and append      |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=428.88)  | to the objects that we're getting back are these rich typed OM objects.                           |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=432.96)  | So you mentioned a few of them like CSS unit value we have.                                       |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=436.28)  | Let's break some more of those down.                                                              |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=437.68)  | I think the base class those CSS style value.                                                     |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=440.48)  | Can you tell us about this base class and why it's important?                                     |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=443.28)  | Yes, so that's exactly it.                                                                        |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=444.92)  | The base class is CSS style value and there are different types.                                  |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=447.96)  | So as you mentioned, there's units, image, keyword, transforms, unparsed values, there's          |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=453.48)  | position.                                                                                         |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=454.48)  | There are a few different ways to get these types of CSS style values.                            |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=458.72)  | So with the CSS style values, you could parse those.                                              |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=462.12)  | And that's a pretty cool feature.                                                                 |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=463.78)  | You could do CSS style value dot parse, and then you give it a property and the CSS text,         |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=468.44)  | which would convert any CSS property value pair into a CSS style value.                           |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=472.96)  | So if you did CSS style value dot parse, and you gave it width, and then comma 50%, that          |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=479.08)  | would return a CSS unit value with the value being 50 and the unit being percent.                 |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=485.16)  | Now another example, this one comes from MDN, I thought this was really cool, is if you           |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=488.52)  | give it a CSS style value dot parse for a transform.                                              |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=492.44)  | So it'd be CSS style value dot parse, and then in a string transform, and then comma              |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=497.16)  | the CSS value.                                                                                    |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=498.64)  | The CSS value here would be translate 3D, and then in parentheses 10px comma 10px comma           |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=503.52)  | zero, end parentheses, and then space scale 0.5.                                                  |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=507.56)  | And then all of that is in one string.                                                            |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=509.28)  | So you can have these more complex values.                                                        |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=511.58)  | And what that would return is a CSS transform value.                                              |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=515.02)  | So this is another type of CSS style value.                                                       |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=517.44)  | It would return a CSS transform value, which would have a CSS translate, CSS scale with           |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=522.92)  | a length of two, and an is2D of false.                                                            |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=526.08)  | So you get all of this information directly in a more semantic CSS representation.                |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=531.28)  | And there's also a CSS style value dot parse all, which returns an array of converted values.     |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=536.6)   | Oh man, CSS style value dot parse, that is one that you can use today.                            |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=541.74)  | Open up Chrome and just start throwing CSS at that.                                               |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=544.64)  | So say CSS style value dot parse open print, font size comma 80 rim, aha, see what it gives       |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=550.84)  | you back.                                                                                         |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=551.84)  | And sort of like you can throw CSS at it and see the rich object that you get back.               |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=555.08)  | You also find the edges of it probably too.                                                       |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=557.12)  | So as we're going through the additional classes that you get, which she's mentioned, CSS style   |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=562.64)  | value, we had a CSS transform value.                                                              |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=565.2)   | We're about to break down these different interfaces that you have, because they're               |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=568.7)   | all sort of like base classes, and then they have prototypes on them.                             |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=571.62)  | But that parse, you can use that right away and it's good stuff.                                  |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=574.98)  | So a couple of these additional interfaces that you get on top of CSS values.                     |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=579.92)  | So what we're looking for in these additional interfaces is more specific information that's      |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=584.68)  | more tied to the type that it's there, right?                                                     |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=587.28)  | So it's like if we're looking for a transform value, it could give us a string back.              |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=591.36)  | But if it's a CSS transform value that's extending, you know, the CSS style value, that is giving |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=596.5)   | us additional metadata, additional information, maybe additional methods like the is 2d flag,     |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=601.84)  | while also giving us the ability to still do everything else.                                     |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=604.32)  | So anyway, let's get into some of these additional interfaces.                                    |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=607.4)   | One of them is the CSS image value object interface.                                              |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=610.48)  | So this is an interface for taking things as an image.                                            |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=613.32)  | This is background image, list style image, border image source, but it doesn't cover             |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=617.08)  | linear gradients.                                                                                 |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=618.08)  | So linear gradient will not come back as a rich object right now, but image values will.          |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=623.42)  | So it's kind of cool.                                                                             |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=624.56)  | Next we have CSS keyword value.                                                                   |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=626.32)  | And this is used for properties that have keywords as values.                                     |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=629.34)  | So an example that is display, display none, and none is the keyword value for the display        |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=635.12)  | property.                                                                                         |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=636.12)  | So you can create new CSS keyword values using the constructor, you can do a element dot          |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=641.36)  | set display with the new CSS keyword value.                                                       |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=644.32)  | You can also get CSS keyword values with dot value.                                               |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=647.52)  | So once you've created it, you could do element dot get, and then display dot value, and you      |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=651.4)   | would get none as the value for CSS keyword value.                                                |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=654.36)  | Right, all the keyword values are known, right?                                                   |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=656.64)  | They're like enumerated somewhere.                                                                |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=658.44)  | So now they're all wrapped up in this base class.                                                 |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=661.08)  | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=662.08)  | And we can talk about them as keyword types.                                                      |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=664.54)  | Super cool.                                                                                       |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=665.54)  | All right, now we have a bunch of CSS numeric values.                                             |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=668.56)  | So this is another class, so we're getting about three or four levels deep in terms of            |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=673.72)  | like prototype chains and class inheritance now.                                                  |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=676.44)  | But so we have CSS numeric values, and this is like the most popular type of CSS value,           |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=681.16)  | I think.                                                                                          |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=682.16)  | There's a lot of numbers in CSS.                                                                  |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=683.16)  | A lot of numbers, right?                                                                          |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=684.72)  | And so the type of numeric values that we have are unit values, math values, and numeric          |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=689.52)  | values.                                                                                           |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=690.72)  | And so we'll talk about each of those really quick.                                               |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=692.16)  | So numeric value can create values.                                                               |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=695.68)  | So this would be like CSS dot PX 23.                                                              |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=698.4)   | So we're creating a new value which will come back as a CSS unit value.                           |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=703.36)  | And anyway, the prototype of a CSS unit value is a CSS numeric value.                             |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=707.38)  | So this is, you can see how the prototype chain is getting heavy really fast.                     |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=710.5)   | But CSS numeric value has a parse function as well.                                               |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=712.98)  | So you can send numeric numbers and get back a broken down object.                                |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=717.24)  | So it would take 23 pixels and come back with something meaningful.                               |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=719.88)  | It would take one rem and return the value of one with a unit of rem.                             |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=724.1)   | So very cool.                                                                                     |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=725.28)  | There's also a type that they're trying to put on here.                                           |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=727.24)  | So this is in the spec.                                                                           |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=728.24)  | So it had a maybe going to ship, maybe not going to ship type of information about it.            |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=732.36)  | But this is, I think, so that you could help you crawl the prototype train or it would            |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=735.6)   | prevent you from needing to crawl it.                                                             |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=737.4)   | You could kind of just ask that what kind of type are you?                                        |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=739.84)  | I was really intrigued by CSS numeric value dot two.                                              |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=743.48)  | So this is a way for you to convert from one type of unit to another.                             |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=747.6)   | So consider CSS dot PX open parenthesis, pass in 23.                                              |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=752.26)  | So we're going to get back a CSS unit value that would be 23 as the value and the pixels          |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=757.96)  | are or the type would be pixels, the unit type would be pixels.                                   |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=760.8)   | And then we can say dot two.                                                                      |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=762.68)  | So this is functional.                                                                            |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=763.68)  | Remember, we got back an object and now we're calling dot two on it, which is a prototype         |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=767.44)  | function on the CSS numeric value.                                                                |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=769.62)  | And we're going to say dot two inches.                                                            |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=771.62)  | So we're going to say here's 23 pixels.                                                           |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=773.96)  | And can you give me inches now?                                                                   |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=775.52)  | Dot two inches.                                                                                   |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=777.04)  | And that works.                                                                                   |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=778.24)  | It can go resolve that and convert it for you.                                                    |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=780.64)  | And it still is a rich object.                                                                    |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=782.58)  | So you can do conversion inside of here just between unit types.                                  |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=786.2)   | But there is a caveat.                                                                            |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=787.72)  | So I ran into something like this.                                                                |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=788.88)  | I was like, okay, well, here's CSS dot pixels 23.                                                 |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=792.2)   | So it's like I got a 23 pixel little value here, numeric value, and I say to rem.                 |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=797.2)   | And it goes, I don't know what rem is.                                                            |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=800.22)  | It's like, and I had to think about it.                                                           |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=802.0)   | I was like, well, I just want you to go from pixels to rems.                                      |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=804.6)   | I do it in calc all the time.                                                                     |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=806.58)  | You know, what's the problem here?                                                                |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=807.58)  | And the problem is I'm trying to assert an absolute value 23 to a relative unit of rem.           |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=815.48)  | And it says relative to what, yo?                                                                 |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=818.28)  | What where?                                                                                       |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=819.28)  | Do you have to pass in like the base font size for that?                                          |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=821.2)   | Can you do that?                                                                                  |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=822.2)   | Right now you can't do it.                                                                        |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=823.2)   | It's not in the spec to say how to go from absolute to a relative unit.                           |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=826.56)  | So there was like discussion is like, yeah, okay, so you could assume that it's the page.         |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=831.56)  | But maybe that's wrong.                                                                           |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=833.06)  | Maybe the element because you're saying this anyway, so it's very tricky.                         |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=836.52)  | There's going to be some API eventually to set a context so that there can be a document          |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=841.12)  | root of some kind to resolve relative units against.                                              |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=844.5)   | So anyway, I hit a really interesting little issue trying to convert from a pixel to a            |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=848.88)  | rem and how to go into this whole history lesson about units and how does a relative              |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=853.56)  | unit resolve.                                                                                     |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=854.56)  | And so we even have an episode on relative and absolute units.                                    |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=857.12)  | I think I should have put that in here.                                                           |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=858.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=859.56)  | And that's why I think it's important to note that as we are talking about typ2m and Houdini      |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=863.8)   | in general, a lot of this is still a work in progress.                                            |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=866.68)  | And it does provide a lot of really great browser benefits and interesting areas to               |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=871.2)   | explore.                                                                                          |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=872.2)   | But, you know, we both ran into fun edges as we sort of started digging into this stuff.          |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=876.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=877.96)  | And so I'll try to breeze over the rest of this numeric value stuff because it's really           |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=880.72)  | fun creating pixels and converting them.                                                          |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=882.44)  | But you can also add them, subtract them, multiply them, divide them, clamp them with             |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=886.84)  | a min and a max.                                                                                  |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=887.84)  | You can do equals and you can say to some.                                                        |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=890.0)   | And so that was numeric values as the class type.                                                 |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=893.0)   | So there's also two more subclasses and that'd be unit value and math value.                      |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=896.26)  | So each of these can use the numeric value functions in the prototype, but they have              |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=899.84)  | additional types in them.                                                                         |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=901.36)  | So a math value is things like you have this object function that you can call called CSS         |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=906.4)   | math negate, CSS math min and CSS math sum.                                                       |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=910.44)  | And you can pass that CSS numeric values and it will do the math against those items for          |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=915.44)  | you.                                                                                              |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=916.44)  | And there's also CSS unit value type that we talked about.                                        |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=918.48)  | And these are values that contain a single unit, like two characters or something.                |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=922.14)  | And you can create them with CSS dot number, CSS dot pixels, or you can retrieve them and         |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=927.12)  | do math on them as well.                                                                          |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=928.2)   | So the numeric value classes have a base class and a few subclasses.                              |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=932.72)  | They have a bunch of math functions on them to help you easily convert between unit types         |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=937.9)   | and do your operations on your units in CSS.                                                      |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=941.12)  | And then you can set them with those setters that we talked about above.                          |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=944.08)  | Anyway, super cool.                                                                               |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=945.08)  | Okay, so that was it for math.                                                                    |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=946.6)   | Tell us about CSS position values, Yuna.                                                          |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=948.84)  | So position value is pretty straightforward.                                                      |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=950.66)  | It is the X and Y object position.                                                                |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=953.4)   | You can get CSS position value dot X, which just returns items position along the web             |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=958.3)   | documents horizontal axis and CSS position value dot Y, which returns items position              |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=963.16)  | along the vertical axis.                                                                          |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=965.52)  | This I could see being really useful for things like when you enter and exit the viewport.        |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=970.14)  | So if you had an animation that you're triggering or if you're trying to get the position of      |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=974.32)  | an item that was dragged or moved, that could be really helpful.                                  |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=977.8)   | There's a lot of application for something like this and for styling things differently           |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=981.1)   | based on their position on the page.                                                              |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=982.56)  | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=983.56)  | I saw really cool and it's similar to like a transform value, but like you only have              |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=986.6)   | to create one of these CSS values in memory and then in your loop you can continue to             |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=991.6)   | update it.                                                                                        |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=992.6)   | So it's like you don't have to keep creating this position value.                                 |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=995.46)  | You just create the value and then you continue updating it and all the other loops that you      |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=999.86)  | have and then setting it wherever you need to set it.                                             |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1002.36) | It's just, it's so memory efficient and handy.                                                    |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1005.18) | It's like it has all these wins across the board.                                                 |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1007.08) | Yeah, that's a great example for using this.                                                      |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1008.84) | Oh, thanks.                                                                                       |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1009.84) | I stole it from someone else, it was just a good example there too.                               |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1013.4)  | The CSS transform value one is especially awesome.                                                |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1016.2)  | So this is made of transform subtypes.                                                            |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1018.92) | So we have CSS rotate, CSS scale and CSS translate as subtypes.                                   |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1023.12) | And this CSS transform value features a Boolean, which you've heard Yuna talk about a couple      |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1027.24) | times already, which is.is2d.                                                                     |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1029.62) | And that will just tell you straight up is a Boolean, is it 2D or not?                            |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1032.92) | So it's the transformation doing anything in the third dimension and you can pivot on             |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1036.84) | that.                                                                                             |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1037.84) | You can so easily convert this CSS transform value to a DOM matrix.                               |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1042.08) | So anyone that's done any DOM matrix work and has managed those strings themselves or             |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1046.82) | those arrays themselves can now rejoice in the typed OM and its ability to sort of break          |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1052.98) | these things down, tell you if they're 2D or not and give you the whole object in a               |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1056.28) | meaningful typed notation.                                                                        |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1058.84) | So go nuts.                                                                                       |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1060.02) | I think we've covered enough the CSS transform values and examples that I'm just going to         |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1063.68) | skip over it.                                                                                     |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1064.88) | So yeah, tell us about CSS unparsed values.                                                       |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1067.72) | So unparsed values are interesting because they refer to custom properties.                       |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1071.92) | And it's important to note and remember that when you write a CSS custom property, if you're      |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1076.36) | writing them in your HTML directly, not as a Houdini custom property, you're probably             |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1081.28) | writing them under root or under another element that you're scoping.                             |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1085.46) | These properties, when you're writing them, do not have a syntax.                                 |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1089.04) | They are just parsed as strings.                                                                  |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1091.44) | And that's why the properties and values API that can actually give you a custom properties       |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1095.54) | syntax is pretty important.                                                                       |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1097.6)  | So when CSS is looking at these custom properties, it's viewing them as an unparsed value.        |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1103.04) | But it's an unparsed value that has two parts.                                                    |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1105.36) | It has a name, so a key, and a value, which is the string based value that you've given           |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1111.32) | it.                                                                                               |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1112.32) | So you can still work with them and you can work with them just like you can with any             |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1116.5)  | of the other CSS style values.                                                                    |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1118.92) | And the way that you work with them is through a series of functions that are available to        |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1122.44) | you to work with them through.                                                                    |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1124.44) | You can use CSS unparsed value dot entries to get back an array as a key value pair for           |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1129.68) | all of your custom properties.                                                                    |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1131.8)  | There's a for each method to execute a function for each pair.                                    |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1135.5)  | You can use keys to get the key for each index that is going to be an array iterator over         |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1140.68) | your CSS unparsed value object.                                                                   |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1143.4)  | And then there's values to return the value for each index.                                       |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1146.28) | So this is just a fancy way to say that you can work with CSS custom properties that don't        |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1151.42) | have a syntax when you're working with the type to them.                                          |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1155.6)  | So that sort of brings us to the end of our episode.                                              |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1158.32) | As we mentioned throughout this conversation, the typed object model is not complete.             |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1163.48) | There's more spec to write, more bugs to find, more workflows to enable.                          |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1167.92) | And one thing that was feeling like a particularly glaring area is color.                         |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1172.78) | We didn't even talk about color on this show.                                                     |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1175.8)  | And that's because working with color is still string based at this time.                         |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1180.8)  | But there are a lot of folks who want to help remedy that and give meaning to color.              |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1184.6)  | It's just really complex right now because you have a lot of different ways to represent          |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1187.72) | color.                                                                                            |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1188.72) | And so we need to figure out how exactly we can make a solution that everyone agrees on           |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1195.0)  | for representation of color as a typed object in the type to him.                                 |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1200.06) | But thank you so much for joining us.                                                             |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1201.96) | The TLDR here is that the CSS type to him enables both performant manipulation of CSS             |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72Wv3rzzW3pND9w7RIuWrp?&t=1207.0)  | and values and clearer, more maintainable code for authors.                                       |
