| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z index.           |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=17.32)   | Today we're talking about pseudo classes.                                                         |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=19.6)    | This episode might be a little bit long, so hang in there because we go over some really          |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=23.08)   | good juicy stuff.                                                                                 |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=24.08)   | You're not going to want to miss it.                                                              |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=25.08)   | This episode is a great natural follow up to our last episode on pseudo elements, which           |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=29.44)   | was episode number 14.                                                                            |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=31.4)    | So if you haven't listened to that yet, go check it out.                                          |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=33.76)   | We have a ton to cover today because there are so many pseudo classes and they're super           |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=37.96)   | interesting for how you can style and select CSS.                                                 |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=42.5)    | You can use pseudo classes and elements individually or combine them.                             |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=46.24)   | So there are a ton of possibilities for how you can use these items in your own code today.       |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=50.8)    | Good call.                                                                                        |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=51.8)    | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=52.8)    | And pseudo classes are selectors.                                                                 |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=53.8)    | Yeah, I mean, this is going to be hard.                                                           |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=55.56)   | There's a lot of like pseudo selector and class words in here, but we're going to nail            |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=58.88)   | it, I'm sure.                                                                                     |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=59.88)   | But yeah, pseudo classes are selectors.                                                           |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=62.08)   | They're simple selectors in the spec and they allow selecting based on stuff that's outside       |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=66.16)   | of the DOM tree.                                                                                  |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=67.16)   | Like the presence can be toggled without any changes to the DOM tree and they'll never            |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=71.76)   | change the DOM tree.                                                                              |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=73.6)    | They essentially represent meta information and meta state about elements that you can't          |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=77.7)    | find in the DOM.                                                                                  |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=78.7)    | So they're pretty much managed by the browser.                                                    |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=80.96)   | And on a high level, there's two types.                                                           |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=82.92)   | There's functional and regular pseudo classes.                                                    |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=85.94)   | And these identify whether or not the selector has parens or not after it.                        |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=89.52)   | So essentially, can it take arguments?                                                            |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=91.92)   | And it's worth noting too that both of these styles can be nested, combined or used as            |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=95.68)   | part of a complex selector.                                                                       |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=98.28)   | Super rad.                                                                                        |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=99.28)   | It's like the composability of CSS is just out of this world.                                     |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=101.66)  | But one of my favorite things about pseudo classes is that they are a micro interaction           |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=105.2)   | opportunity dreamland.                                                                            |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=107.32)  | If you like providing rich UI feedback, then these classes are free states for you to leverage    |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=112.04)  | and transform a static page into something very dynamic.                                          |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=115.32)  | Definitely.                                                                                       |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=116.32)  | And the first way to use these pseudo classes is to represent UI pseudo states.                   |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=122.28)  | So let's start with link.                                                                         |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=124.16)  | Link which is written as colon link because you use a single colon for pseudo classes             |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=129.52)  | versus a double colon for pseudo elements.                                                        |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=132.0)   | With link, link allows you to target every unvisited link.                                        |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=135.72)  | So that would be on an a element, area element or link element that has an href attribute,        |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=141.44)  | which is a hyperlink reference.                                                                   |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=143.36)  | This is a state of those elements and would override the base styling applied to a link.          |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=149.28)  | So if you had a and then in brackets color red as your base styling for all links on              |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=155.08)  | the page, and then you had a colon link color blue underneath that, the link would be blue        |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=162.56)  | until visited because then it would be the other state which is not specified to be visited.      |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=170.38)  | So that's kind of like a funky thing for link.                                                    |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=173.48)  | So link is one of four ways to style links, the specificity of which can be described             |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=177.94)  | by the acronym, live, ha, LV, H, I don't know why, but live, ha is like a thing I saw on          |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=184.92)  | multiple websites.                                                                                |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=185.92)  | I was like, okay, we're going with it, which is link and then visited and then hover and          |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=191.36)  | then active.                                                                                      |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=192.36)  | So active is the most specific, hover is less specific than that, visited less specific           |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=196.6)   | than that, and then colon link.                                                                   |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=199.04)  | So as I was mentioning the non-visited link style earlier, you can also style visited             |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=207.04)  | links.                                                                                            |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=208.04)  | So with visited links, you'd use the colon visited pseudo class.                                  |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=212.28)  | This targets visited links and it's cool that you can do that, but it's pretty limited            |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=216.88)  | and I can actually style these for security purposes.                                             |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=220.08)  | And the fine print here is for privacy concerns, browser strictly limit the styles you can        |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=225.04)  | apply using an element selected by the pseudo class, only color, background color, border         |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=230.14)  | color and its sub properties, outline color, column rule color, and the color parts of            |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=234.84)  | fill and stroke can be used.                                                                      |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=236.8)   | So that is really limited, more limited than the styling we can apply for the pseudo elements     |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=240.48)  | that we mentioned in the last show.                                                               |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=242.32)  | But I did write a blog post on how I added an unread tag on my personal blog's unread             |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=249.28)  | post using the visited pseudo class and a link that in the show notes, but I thought              |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=254.76)  | it was kind of fun.                                                                               |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=255.76)  | It kind of like hacks the visited pseudo class.                                                   |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=258.36)  | So check that out if you want to do more with visited.                                            |

| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=296.2)   | Anyway, there's also colon hover.                                                                 |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=298.44)  | And if you have a pointing device and you've moved it around and you've put the arrow on          |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=302.32)  | top of something else, then you've hovered before the platform or browser designates              |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=306.38)  | when hover is applied.                                                                            |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=307.86)  | And it's essentially whenever a visual pointer is over or on top of another element that          |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=311.76)  | hasn't yet been interacted with.                                                                  |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=314.0)   | It's really great to show UI feedback that the element being considered by the user is            |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=318.52)  | an interactive element and will produce results if interacted with.                               |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=321.92)  | So it's one of the first moments where a user gets to discover through their exploration          |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=326.76)  | if this thing is interactive.                                                                     |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=328.32)  | So make hover effects.                                                                            |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=329.8)   | They're really nice.                                                                              |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=330.8)   | They provide great UI feedback.                                                                   |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=332.54)  | There's also active.                                                                              |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=334.12)  | And this is the rich moment where a user is interacting with and activating an element.           |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=339.4)   | It's between hover and release.                                                                   |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=341.84)  | Right?                                                                                            |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=342.84)  | Okay, so we talk about micro interactions and there's a state between hover and release.          |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=346.4)   | I mean, you might only see it for like 30 milliseconds, but that's enough for you to              |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=349.56)  | feel more confident that the interface is responding to you as a user.                            |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=352.92)  | So it's worth noting that an element can be both active and visited or active and a link.         |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=357.64)  | So very cool.                                                                                     |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=358.64)  | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=359.64)  | So speaking of hover and active, next I want to talk about focus, focus within and focus          |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=365.28)  | visible, which are all similar but very distinct.                                                 |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=368.62)  | So let's start with focus.                                                                        |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=370.6)   | Focus happens either programmatically or when an element is clicked on or tabbed to with          |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=375.32)  | the keyboard.                                                                                     |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=376.32)  | So a common styling adjustment would be the focus ring here with that visual outline looks        |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=380.98)  | like to make it fit your brand more.                                                              |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=383.78)  | Focus within lets you style an element based on if it's children are in focus.                    |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=388.62)  | So I recently use this for a tool tip.                                                            |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=391.22)  | The goal here was when users tab through a data grid, we wanted a tool tip to appear              |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=396.5)   | with some additional information and a link within it.                                            |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=399.46)  | This also mimic the interaction for hover.                                                        |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=401.88)  | I always say everywhere you have a hover have an equal focus.                                     |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=406.34)  | So usually you're doing like colon hover comma colon focus to make sure that users, when          |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=411.1)   | you have a hover interaction can have the same interaction on focus.                              |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=414.38)  | So with this tool tip, we injected each tool tip next to the grid item that made it visible       |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=419.98)  | upon the hover focus and use the sibling selector, which is the plus to apply styles              |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=425.22)  | to it, which was great that worked on focus.                                                      |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=428.62)  | But when the focus moved inside of the tool tip to the link, which was read more to get           |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=433.48)  | more information about that specific item, focus was lost.                                        |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=436.9)   | And that's because you're no longer focusing on the parent.                                       |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=439.48)  | You were focusing on a child of the parent.                                                       |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=441.94)  | This was fixed with focus within, which applied both focus and focus within styles to the         |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=448.34)  | parent.                                                                                           |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=449.34)  | Now, when you do that, when you're focused on the parent or within it within the tool             |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=453.18)  | tip, that tool tip remained visible.                                                              |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=455.2)   | So focus within really helped with that.                                                          |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=457.94)  | And this was awesome when it landed a couple of years ago and I loved it.                         |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=462.14)  | Yeah, it's great.                                                                                 |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=463.14)  | Not even a couple of years.                                                                       |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=464.14)  | It was like three years ago, but it's fully supported in all modern browsers.                     |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=467.74)  | So there's also focus visible.                                                                    |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=470.54)  | This is experimental and behind a flag in Chrome and edge and Firefox has it, but it's            |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=476.06)  | with a nonstandard name, which is colon dash Moz dash focus ring.                                 |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=480.8)   | So focus visible is a tool that allows for the responsible removal of a focus ring when           |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=486.06)  | you don't want one such as like on a button while focus matches anytime a control has             |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=491.88)  | focus for any reason whatsoever, like on click or touch or tab focus visible matches when         |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=498.34)  | a control has focus and the browser UA decides we need to focus like an input field that          |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=503.9)   | you touch.                                                                                        |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=505.12)  | So another example of this, which sort of instigated the entire need for focus visible            |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=510.5)   | is the button element.                                                                            |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=512.24)  | When you click a button, it's in focus by default, it doesn't get a focus ring.                   |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=516.62)  | So when you click that button, the background on the default element on Chrome turns blue         |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=520.94)  | from the gray color.                                                                              |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=522.54)  | But if you apply any CSS styling change to it, anything changing the border, changing             |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=528.14)  | the background, it suddenly will get a focus ring when you click on it.                           |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=532.46)  | So now when you click on the button, if you have custom styles, you're going to get a             |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=535.5)   | focus ring and people don't like that.                                                            |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=537.38)  | They're not used to it.                                                                           |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=538.52)  | So they tend to just apply focus outline none on the button, removing the focus entirely          |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=544.02)  | for it.                                                                                           |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=545.02)  | Yeah, don't do that.                                                                              |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=546.66)  | So now people who are tabbing through the page or using keyboard for navigation will              |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=551.36)  | have no focus styles, but focus visible allows developers to remove that outline on the click     |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=557.98)  | while still applying a style to the tab focus.                                                    |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=561.64)  | So it enables users to remove those focus styles responsively and provide a feedback              |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=567.02)  | mechanism for people on their keyboard.                                                           |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=568.78)  | So sort of like a smart default.                                                                  |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=570.18)  | And it'll be dope for this to land from behind the flag.                                          |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=573.82)  | Yeah, strong agree.                                                                               |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=575.9)   | And you nailed that explanation.                                                                  |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=577.26)  | Seriously, that is a moment that everyone has ran into.                                           |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=580.66)  | And we're excited for resolution where we're going to get the best of both worlds.                |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=583.62)  | It's gonna be great.                                                                              |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=584.62)  | All right, that was focus, focus visible and focus within.                                        |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=588.22)  | This is colon target.                                                                             |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=590.14)  | So this lets you leverage aspects of the URL in your styles.                                      |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=594.1)   | If you have, let's say, a hashtag about in your URL to stash some state, you know, like           |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=599.7)   | you just want to stash some state up there, you can use that hashtag about part of the            |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=602.94)  | URL to style an element that has a matching ID in the page.                                       |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=606.86)  | So this is a classic pseudo class for CSS only hackers.                                           |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=610.34)  | You can have a link point, you know, like you click a link and it has an href to hashtag          |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=614.46)  | whatever, which changes the URL to that hash.                                                     |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=617.18)  | And then you have a matching element in the DOM that updates its style because the URL            |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=621.22)  | changed.                                                                                          |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=622.22)  | So you have no JavaScript here and you get to have a bunch of state.                              |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=624.5)   | The URL bar is the state and given you can change it without JavaScript, like at the              |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=628.18)  | link, you've got a recipe for stateful and dynamic interaction.                                   |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=632.54)  | Folks have really obsessed and taken this really far and it's super cool.                         |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=635.46)  | I like what they've done there.                                                                   |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=636.9)   | There's also one in the spec called target within.                                                |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=639.3)   | So I learned about this one.                                                                      |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=640.58)  | There's no support for this yet, but it sounds super rad and it's just like focus within          |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=644.08)  | except target within.                                                                             |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=645.52)  | So this allows you to sort of know if a child has the target with the URL bar and you can         |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=649.72)  | style a whole section of content that way.                                                        |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=652.16)  | Super neat.                                                                                       |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=653.16)  | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=654.16)  | So the next topic is about lang and dir and these take attributes.                                |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=659.84)  | So lang is written colon lang and then in parentheses you would have the language and             |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=664.58)  | then dir is colon dir and then in that you'd have direction.                                      |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=667.64)  | So with lang it would take any country code and with dir it would take either RTL or LTR,         |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=673.54)  | which stands for right to left or left to right, which represents a reading and writing           |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=677.22)  | mode.                                                                                             |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=678.22)  | So change in direction attributes allow for styling specific to the language of the user          |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=682.92)  | agent or the direction or even you could write multiple attributes within the document that       |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=689.56)  | change language and direction, which could be great for a website that teaches language           |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=693.96)  | and needs to show different types of language to the user.                                        |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=696.82)  | So we talk about reading writing modes and logical flow in our logical properties episode.        |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=701.16)  | I would definitely recommend checking that out.                                                   |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=703.28)  | There's a ton of great auto updating layout goodness that you get when using logical properties   |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=707.66)  | for margins, layout placement and more.                                                           |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=710.64)  | Starting with lang, it's commonly set on the HTML with the lang attribute, but can also           |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=714.38)  | come from meta tags and you could change the quote styles, for example, based on language         |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=719.5)   | or set a different background image or change colors.                                             |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=722.2)   | I don't know, the world is your oyster.                                                           |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=723.7)   | You can do anything by targeting lang, but a more useful example would be changing the            |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=728.62)  | quote style.                                                                                      |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=729.62)  | So if you have a paragraph and the language of that is English, it would look like p colon        |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=733.26)  | lang and then in parentheses en and then you could do like space Q or then greater than           |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=738.06)  | Q to target quotes inside of that and send a specific quote style.                                |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=742.8)   | So like the double quote.                                                                         |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=744.42)  | If you have French, for example, the quote styles are slightly different.                         |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=747.98)  | So you could send the open and closing like double side angle bracket quotes that would           |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=753.96)  | be p colon lang and then in the parentheses fr and that styles quotes that are more uniform       |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=759.86)  | with that language.                                                                               |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=760.86)  | Sick.                                                                                             |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=761.86)  | So pretty cool.                                                                                   |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=762.86)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=763.86)  | But now let's get into dir direction.                                                             |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=767.14)  | This too can be set as naturally in the HTML, but it's important to note that the colon           |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=772.58)  | dir pseudo class is not equivalent to the attribute in brackets dir equals the pseudo             |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=778.98)  | class will automatically match the value calculated by the user agents and it will even inherit   |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=784.82)  | while the data attribute, which is in brackets dir equals only matches if there's a specific      |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=790.06)  | attribute set on the page.                                                                        |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=791.74)  | So the author would have to write the direction on the HTML or some other element within the      |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=796.46)  | page for the attribute to match.                                                                  |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=798.82)  | But the pseudo class is going to read the user agent.                                             |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=802.34)  | So you don't have to specify it at all, like specifically.                                        |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=805.22)  | So here you could style colon dir either ltr, rtl and then apply updated styles based on          |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=810.58)  | the directionality, which you might need if you're not using logical properties, but you          |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=814.26)  | might want to also do additional fun things.                                                      |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=816.42)  | I don't know.                                                                                     |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=817.42)  | Like I said, the world is your oyster.                                                            |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=819.22)  | There's not really like a strong limit here of what you can style.                                |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=821.82)  | I mean, nice breakdown too.                                                                       |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=823.34)  | And this is a great sort of topic item to recap that pseudo classes, again, they can't            |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=827.74)  | change the DOM and they don't have anything to do with the DOM.                                   |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=830.3)   | And it shows right here with language and direction where, you know, there's nothing              |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=833.46)  | in the HTML that says the direction.                                                              |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=836.3)   | I mean, you can put it in there, but the pseudo class that we get for free is coming from         |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=840.5)   | the browser.                                                                                      |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=841.5)   | So the browser is like, here's what's set at the platform, you know, and you can style            |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=843.9)   | with that information.                                                                            |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=844.9)   | It's really rad.                                                                                  |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=845.9)   | Yeah, it's super useful.                                                                          |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=846.9)   | Yeah, right.                                                                                      |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=847.9)   | Our next one is a negation functional pseudo class and that's colon not.                          |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=853.5)   | And so it's a functional pseudo class because it takes the parentheses, it takes some arguments   |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=857.7)   | and it takes a selector list as an argument in which it will increase the specificity             |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=862.12)  | of the selector by the most specific match in the list.                                           |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=864.82)  | So anytime you use colon not, you can pass a comma separated set of selectors in there            |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=869.98)  | and it will take the one that is the most specific.                                               |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=873.0)   | So the highest specificity and add that to the overall specificity of the selector.               |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=877.7)   | Anyway, kind of tricky, interesting little niche specificity knowledge.                           |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=881.26)  | But this pseudo class helps you when you need to answer questions like which buttons are          |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=884.58)  | not disabled or find all links that have no href or find all the images without alt text.         |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=890.9)   | And so that last example would be image colon not open parentheses, open square bracket           |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=896.5)   | alt for the attribute name that you're looking for and parentheses and closing square brackets.   |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=901.26)  | So we're basically saying if the image does not have the alt attribute, then it will be           |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=905.58)  | selected and you can give it an outline red or something and call it out and lint a webpage       |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=909.74)  | and be like, this image has no alt attributes and did it all with CSS.                            |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=912.86)  | It's kind of cool.                                                                                |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=913.86)  | And small note, pseudo elements cannot be targeted by this pseudo class.                          |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=917.9)   | So kind of interesting.                                                                           |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=918.9)   | Oh, good to know.                                                                                 |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=919.9)   | And I really liked your examples of using this to make sure that you have links specified         |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=924.9)   | and have alt text or if you don't have alt text, you do it on purpose.                            |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=928.62)  | So really great examples of using not, I've definitely used this a bunch.                         |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=932.3)   | So we also have colon enabled, enabled basically selects any element that is not disabled.        |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=938.62)  | An element is enabled if it can be activated.                                                     |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=941.26)  | So that's either clicked, tabbed into selected typed within or accept focus.                      |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=946.02)  | Right.                                                                                            |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=947.02)  | And then we have disabled and that's if an element or qualifying element is in a disabled         |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=950.26)  | state as determined by the browser.                                                               |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=952.72)  | And then the selector matches and disabled elements should look and feel like they reject         |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=956.58)  | or don't accept interaction sort of the opposite of being enabled.                                |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=959.86)  | So sort of moving on in forms world, we have checked and indeterminate.                           |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=964.5)   | And these are both representative of items that you use within input types.                       |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=970.28)  | So checked represents a check mark or radio button or an options selected state.                  |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=975.76)  | So the elements that check can be used within our input type equals checkbox, input type          |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=980.12)  | equals radio, and then the option element within a select element.                                |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=985.14)  | So you can actually do a surprising amount with colon checked.                                    |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=988.18)  | I've used this in pure CSS games.                                                                 |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=991.02)  | One was a whack-a-mole game where the targets moved around and the targets themselves were        |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=995.42)  | check boxes.                                                                                      |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=996.42)  | So if you clicked on one, the element became checked and I was able to then style sibling         |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1000.18) | selectors and tally up counters based on how many were checked.                                   |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1003.86) | And I'll leave a link in the show notes.                                                          |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1005.38) | I have two examples of CSS games and then article about writing CSS games with checked            |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1009.9)  | and counters.                                                                                     |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1010.9)  | And it's just a fun thing to do.                                                                  |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1013.1)  | But you know, of course you could also style the check boxes that you've checked.                 |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1016.5)  | So there's also indeterminate.                                                                    |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1018.94) | And indeterminate is actually what I recently learned about when working with data tables         |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1023.24) | in the material design team.                                                                      |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1025.48) | Indeterminate is a possible checkbox state and it looks like a minus or horizontal line           |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1030.66) | in Chrome and in Firefox that can be used when a checkbox is neither true nor false.              |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1036.46) | So for example, if you have a list of items, say you're ordering a pizza and there are            |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1040.76) | sections like vegetables and under vegetables you have peppers, broccoli, tomato, and asparagus.  |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1046.16) | You could select all of the children by clicking on the parent checkbox, vegetables, and now      |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1051.14) | that parent checkbox is going to be checked.                                                      |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1053.42) | It's true.                                                                                        |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1054.42) | It's selected.                                                                                    |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1055.42) | All of its children are selected.                                                                 |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1056.42) | However, if you select only a few child options like peppers and tomatoes or uncheck some         |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1061.5)  | of those options after you've selected them all, then the parent checkbox of vegetables           |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1065.58) | is partially true.                                                                                |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1067.06) | So it is an indeterminate state.                                                                  |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1069.58) | You can also use the state for progress in web forms or wizards or digital tasks and              |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1074.94) | a lot of other use cases.                                                                         |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1076.26) | I really like indeterminate.                                                                      |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1077.26) | It was one of the things we focused on a lot at the design studios we were at because you         |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1081.32) | find that users spend a lot of time in it.                                                        |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1083.24) | So it's great for asynchronous tasks is essentially my picture with indeterminate because that    |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1087.48) | moment when you call out to a web service and you're not in control of it and the response        |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1091.26) | could be any time, it could be really fast or really slow, you're in an indeterminate             |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1095.22) | moment and that fetch is in an indeterminate state and we can use these pseudo classes            |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1100.34) | to help us with there and this basically because we can show the user that we're working.         |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1106.14) | It feels to users that they can end up spending a lot of time in an indeterminate state and       |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1110.04) | we can style these states and make sure they're like entertaining or providing some text or       |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1113.86) | something to make sure that users don't feel it's broken or it's not working.                     |
| [18:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1117.36) | So it's kind of another one of those micro interaction dreamland moments.                         |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1121.54) | Yeah, that's a great example.                                                                     |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1123.48) | The next one we have here on our pseudo class list is colon full screen and this one is           |
| [18:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1127.5)  | pretty self explanatory, right?                                                                   |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1129.3)  | Do stuff on the page when the content is in full screen.                                          |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1132.18) | Support is pretty good but on Safari you do need to use a pseudo class that's specific            |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1136.7)  | for them.                                                                                         |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1137.7)  | It's WebKit.                                                                                      |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1138.7)  | So it's colon dash WebKit dash full dash screen.                                                  |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1141.34) | So where the spec says it's colon full screen with no dashes, the WebKit one does have dashes     |
| [19:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1146.74) | in between full and screen.                                                                       |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1148.34) | So anyway, full screen.                                                                           |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1149.38) | You can style stuff when something's full screen.                                                 |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1151.74) | Very cool.                                                                                        |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1152.74) | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1153.74) | So we're moving out of some of those UI states and into pseudo classes that are very structural.  |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1158.98) | So what these mean is these aren't going to be referencing, you know, like a Chrome or            |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1162.74) | browser managed state of an input.                                                                |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1164.62) | This is going to be referencing the contents of an element, something very structural.            |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1169.34) | So we'll start with root.                                                                         |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1170.98) | This is colon root.                                                                               |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1171.98) | You've probably used this before for your custom properties.                                      |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1175.08) | And as the name suggests, this is tree related and it represents the top most or the bottom       |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1180.34) | most element of the page.                                                                         |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1181.54) | Anyway, whatever in a tree, it's the bottom, but on your web page it's the top.                   |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1185.3)  | But anyway, whatever, it's the root.                                                              |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1186.46) | It's the start of it all.                                                                         |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1187.62) | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1188.62) | So on the web components with shadow DOM, it's the root of the element in context.                |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1192.26) | So just like how an iframe has its own root.                                                      |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1195.06) | So you can have multiple roots on a page, but just know that the root is the root element.        |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1200.02) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1201.02) | And you can reference it.                                                                         |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1202.66) | The next pseudo class that we are going to talk about in the segment is colon empty and           |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1207.86) | empty selects any element that has no children.                                                   |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1210.34) | I will say be careful when using this because text nodes and white space are considered           |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1214.62) | children.                                                                                         |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1215.62) | So that element would not be technically empty.                                                   |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1217.86) | I've used empty before in little demos to send some content for placeholder text, selecting       |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1222.86) | elements like the collection parent and a styling collection parent colon empty colon             |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1228.9)  | after and sending some content in the pseudo element that says like, oh, I'm empty.               |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1234.36) | Or you can get more specific with that if you have more specific types.                           |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1238.18) | I've linked a demo in the show notes on how to use this with the empty pseudo class and           |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1242.62) | custom properties.                                                                                |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1244.02) | Be weary about accessibility here, though, because while some screen readers do read              |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1248.62) | pseudo elements, most modern ones do not all screen readers do.                                   |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1252.02) | And you want to make sure that your user gets all the content.                                    |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1254.56) | And this would be a contentful piece of information in this case.                                 |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1258.02) | Yeah, I like that you put the warnings in there.                                                  |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1259.74) | I've used this one a lot with, you know, JavaScript frameworks because you can micromanage the    |
| [21:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1263.82) | children, you know, and in some cases like old Angular, like I would have no children,            |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1267.94) | but it would render like a new line break in the div.                                             |
| [21:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1270.34) | Yeah, it's not empty anymore.                                                                     |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1271.98) | And then empty wouldn't match.                                                                    |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1273.96) | So then you'd have to go figure out why Angular is putting in like empty spaces.                  |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1276.84) | So it can be sometimes a little tricky with frameworks or sometimes frameworks can make           |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1280.58) | it easy.                                                                                          |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1281.58) | But yeah, empty.                                                                                  |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1282.58) | I've used that one also to hide elements that don't have any text.                                |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1286.14) | Like what if you find a button that's empty?                                                      |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1288.42) | You don't want to show like a little square.                                                      |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1290.18) | It'd be a little interactive square.                                                              |
| [21:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1291.86) | So you could hide all buttons that are empty with one little selector, say button colon           |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1295.7)  | empty.                                                                                            |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1296.7)  | Anyway, display none.                                                                             |
| [21:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1297.7)  | So the next one here is the is functional pseudo class.                                           |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1301.12) | It's colon is with parentheses, and this is the kind of successor to matches or any if            |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1306.5)  | you've seen our video that we did on next gen web styling, you'll see us talk about               |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1310.66) | this, but this is one that's been sitting in WebKit for so long.                                  |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1313.76) | You just don't even know it's there.                                                              |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1315.34) | It was behind the name of colon dash WebKit dash any.                                             |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1318.86) | It's even in user agents dating back like 15 years.                                               |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1321.86) | So anyway, it's crazy, but it lets you pass a selector list into the middle of a complex          |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1326.1)  | selector.                                                                                         |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1327.1)  | So that's essentially, in my opinion, the most succinct way to describe its value.                |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1330.54) | It lets you pass a selector list in the middle of a complex selector.                             |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1334.5)  | And it does other things too.                                                                     |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1335.74) | But anyway, that's I feel like its strongest value prop.                                          |
| [22:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1337.78) | Okay, so like, for example, let's say I want to select my parents, siblings and first cousins     |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1343.72) | and their parents.                                                                                |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1345.14) | So this is where I get to say I got to use is right there, which was kind of nice.                |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1348.98) | I got to pass in a complex list in the middle of a query.                                         |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1352.3)  | Otherwise I'd be saying something like I want my parents, siblings, parents and my parents,       |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1356.42) | first cousins, parents.                                                                           |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1357.9)  | So maybe if that was a little too convoluted, I can make a candy reference.                       |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1361.38) | Right?                                                                                            |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1362.38) | Let's imagine we're in a candy store.                                                             |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1363.58) | I want any new candy that the chocolate is either citrus, blueberry or cookies and cream.         |
| [22:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1369.42) | And then I want the bars.                                                                         |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1370.74) | So I want new chocolate bars only if there's citrus, blueberry and cookies and cream.             |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1375.02) | That's a good example.                                                                            |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1376.02) | Thanks.                                                                                           |
| [22:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1377.02) | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1378.02) | I was like candy store.                                                                           |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1379.02) | So good.                                                                                          |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1380.02) | And that lets you do that in there.                                                               |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1381.02) | There's also a really valuable time I use it.                                                     |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1382.02) | So Una mentioned earlier in here, like if you're doing focus, you should probably bring           |
| [23:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1384.78) | along its friend, hover.                                                                          |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1386.44) | Or if you're doing hover, you should bring along its friend focus and is, is perfect              |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1389.7)  | for that.                                                                                         |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1390.7)  | So I'll do something like this on like an anchor, for example, be like a colon is open            |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1394.74) | parentheses colon, hover, comma, colon, focus and parentheses.                                    |
| [23:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1399.02) | So now in one statement I'm writing this complex selector saying if this anchor is in a hover     |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1403.4)  | or a focus state, style it.                                                                       |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1405.68) | So I can group that complex list of states in the middle of another complex selector.             |
| [23:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1410.7)  | Super cool stuff.                                                                                 |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1412.04) | And again, just like the not functional pseudo class, it does take the highest specificity        |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1417.62) | selector that was passed in as an argument.                                                       |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1419.38) | And that will be what is added to the specificity of the total selector.                          |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1422.92) | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [23:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1423.92) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1424.92) | That's a really nice addition and a great example there.                                          |
| [23:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1426.94) | Thanks.                                                                                           |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1427.94) | So I'm going to talk about placeholders now in our last episode, we talked about colon            |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1432.2)  | colon placeholder, which allows for you to style the placeholder element within a input.          |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1438.04) | So that could be a text area or like a login form or a search that would be the hint text         |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1444.04) | within that input area that is not the label, but it could act as label or just a example         |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1448.72) | of what to write in there.                                                                        |
| [24:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1450.08) | It's a placeholder.                                                                               |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1451.16) | So colon placeholder dash shown selects any element which could have a placeholder like           |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1456.84) | the input and text area and has a placeholder showing.                                            |
| [24:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1460.0)  | So for example, if you have that search input with the placeholder of search, you could           |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1463.56) | set a base style.                                                                                 |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1464.88) | And when the user starts typing, the placeholder goes away, placeholder is no longer visible,     |
| [24:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1469.46) | then the style would change.                                                                      |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1470.88) | So this would be styling when the placeholder is shown on the rest of that input.                 |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1475.86) | And then when you click in it and the placeholder disappears, you can also change the styling     |
| [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1479.72) | on that full input.                                                                               |
| [24:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1481.04) | So for example, you could have a background going from gray to white to denote a more             |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1485.26) | activated state.                                                                                  |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1486.26) | Though you could also do this with focus and probably five other ways.                            |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1489.0)  | Anyway, the point is that you can style placeholder shown along with your colon colon placeholder |
| [24:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1493.68) | pseudo element.                                                                                   |
| [24:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1494.68) | That's a cool moment of customers.                                                                |
| [24:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1495.68) | And again, a little micro interaction.                                                            |
| [24:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1497.36) | Love the micro interactions.                                                                      |
| [24:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1498.36) | Right?                                                                                            |

| [25:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1501.36) | The placeholder has been shown or the placeholder is not showing anymore.                         |
| [25:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1503.84) | They can't see my hint.                                                                           |

| [25:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1506.84) | Cool.                                                                                             |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1507.84) | Yes.                                                                                              |
| [25:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1508.84) | Love this control.                                                                                |
| [25:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1509.84) | The web.                                                                                          |
| [25:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1510.84) | Love it.                                                                                          |
| [25:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1511.84) | We've also got some other structural pseudo classes here.                                         |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1512.84) | This is colon optional, colon required and colon blank.                                           |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1516.04) | So these are more input relevant pseudo classes.                                                  |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1518.96) | And these select inputs that are based on the values that they hold.                              |
| [25:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1522.04) | Right?                                                                                            |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1523.04) | So these are structural.                                                                          |
| [25:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1524.04) | They're testing whether or not there's content inside of there.                                   |
| [25:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1526.88) | And the browser is the one that determines whether or not they qualify for these states           |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1530.0)  | or not.                                                                                           |
| [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1531.0)  | So the colon required inputs have an explicit attribute on them that you have to put called       |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1534.4)  | required and it signals to the browser that the form that they're part of will not submit         |
| [25:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1538.48) | unless the input receives a valid value.                                                          |
| [25:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1541.36) | Then you have a colon optional and these elements are those that aren't required.                 |
| [25:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1545.52) | So kind of you get pretty much everything is optional unless it's explicitly required.            |
| [25:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1549.88) | And the last one that we mentioned here is blank colon blank.                                     |
| [25:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1553.04) | It's let's just say it currently has no support and it's mostly because a name can be decided     |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1558.28) | on.                                                                                               |
| [25:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1559.28) | We have empty, right?                                                                             |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1560.28) | We talked about empty earlier.                                                                    |
| [26:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1561.28) | That's also structurally relevant.                                                                |
| [26:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1563.24) | It's like, is there stuff in here or not?                                                         |
| [26:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1565.56) | But it gets kind of funky like empty needs, you know, no white space and nothing.                 |
| [26:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1569.8)  | And so that's why blank is there as a sort of like other type of empty that is only on            |
| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1574.72) | inputs.                                                                                           |
| [26:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1575.72) | Anyway, we'll link to the GitHub issue in the show notes for those curious folks that             |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1578.56) | want to go comment or read up on why blank is having a hard time making it through the            |

| [26:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1583.88) | Or suggest a better name.                                                                         |
| [26:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1584.88) | Yeah, do that.                                                                                    |
| [26:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1585.88) | That's always something you can do.                                                               |
| [26:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1588.24) | So moving on with our forms discussion, the next three pseudo classes that I want to talk         |
| [26:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1592.44) | about are valid, invalid, and in range.                                                           |
| [26:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1595.98) | Valid and invalid both coincide with the HTML5 form validation capabilities, which in themselves  |
| [26:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1602.48) | are super cool.                                                                                   |
| [26:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1603.88) | An example of this is if you have a form element for an email or phone number, you can give       |
| [26:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1608.76) | a specific regex pattern to match it to.                                                          |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1612.16) | The pattern is passed as an HTML attribute, so no additional JavaScript is required.              |
| [26:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1616.76) | And that in itself is just super rad because you don't need additional JavaScript files           |
| [27:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1620.72) | to manage your form validation.                                                                   |
| [27:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1622.2)  | You could do it in HTML.                                                                          |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1623.62) | You can also send min and max values or lengths, steps for items like date values, and set        |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1628.6)  | fields.                                                                                           |
| [27:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1629.6)  | You can mark those as required or not.                                                            |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1631.84) | So all of these you can identify and then you need all these to be valid in order for             |
| [27:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1637.32) | the form to be submitted.                                                                         |
| [27:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1638.8)  | So again, pretty cool interaction that you can do there.                                          |
| [27:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1641.8)  | In HTML and markup.                                                                               |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1643.86) | So the valid pseudo class allows for you to then style those form elements when they are          |
| [27:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1649.8)  | valid.                                                                                            |
| [27:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1650.8)  | So you can, for instance, add a little green checkmark or smiley face when someone entered        |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1654.36) | in a valid email or date within a range or a search entry.                                        |
| [27:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1659.4)  | I don't know, whatever you want to do there.                                                      |
| [27:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1660.8)  | And then you can have colon invalid, which is the opposite and lets you provide some              |
| [27:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1664.12) | visual user feedback and style form elements that are invalid.                                    |
| [27:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1667.56) | So if you have some form validation for passwords, you know, like, oh, requires two numbers and   |
| [27:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1672.92) | like a additional character that's not a number or a letter, which a lot of form requires         |
| [27:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1678.48) | now.                                                                                              |
| [27:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1679.48) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [28:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1680.48) | You could have this invalid state to let your user know that the input there is not valid.        |
| [28:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1686.44) | And then you could have like a little sad face or an X or style it in a color with kind           |
| [28:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1690.72) | of visual icon indicator.                                                                         |
| [28:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1692.4)  | So that's valid and invalid.                                                                      |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1694.4)  | And then you could have the in range when you have an input element within a minimum              |
| [28:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1701.12) | and maximum that are set for that range.                                                          |
| [28:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1704.08) | So when the current value inside that is valid, but it is valid within a range.                   |
| [28:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1708.46) | So for example, you might have a number input type within a min of five and a max of one          |
| [28:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1713.44) | hundred and five for an age range.                                                                |
| [28:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1715.82) | And then if you wrote like two hundred, you're probably not alive.                                |
| [28:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1718.88) | So that would be not in range.                                                                    |
| [28:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1721.56) | Remember, you could always style adjacent and child elements based on these pseudo class          |
| [28:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1726.76) | states.                                                                                           |
| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1727.84) | So they're actually pretty powerful because you can always style around them based on             |
| [28:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1731.96) | those states.                                                                                     |
| [28:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1733.3)  | Super powerful.                                                                                   |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1734.3)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [28:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1735.3)  | You mentioned valid and invalid.                                                                  |
| [28:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1736.3)  | And I started thinking about form inputs that as I type into them, they go a green border         |
| [29:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1740.84) | and a green checkbox like animates in like valid and invalid are actually really rich             |
| [29:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1746.6)  | moments where you should reward a user.                                                           |
| [29:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1748.72) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [29:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1749.72) | Right.                                                                                            |
| [29:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1750.72) | So when you talk about this form, it's a pain in the butt to fill out forms and you put           |
| [29:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1753.2)  | a valid entry in here.                                                                            |
| [29:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1754.56) | It's a pain in the butt to have at least two numbers and at least eight characters and            |
| [29:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1758.28) | at least one additional character.                                                                |
| [29:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1760.32) | Right.                                                                                            |
| [29:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1761.32) | So yeah, indicate to them when they're doing well, we're like little kids on the web, you         |
| [29:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1764.56) | know, they're like, give me a green checkbox and make a happy sound.                              |
| [29:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1768.72) | You can do that.                                                                                  |
| [29:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1769.72) | You can do that.                                                                                  |
| [29:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1770.72) | All right.                                                                                        |
| [29:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1771.72) | So we also have some other structural pseudo classes to talk about.                               |
| [29:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1774.12) | And these are list contextual.                                                                    |
| [29:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1777.4)  | It's kind of cool.                                                                                |
| [29:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1778.4)  | So colon first dash child, colon last dash child and colon only dash child.                       |
| [29:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1784.16) | So I'll just without all the syntax, we have first last and only child ability.                   |
| [29:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1788.92) | And so like I said, these are list contextual pseudo classes and they operate on a branch.        |
| [29:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1793.2)  | So if you think about your tree, this operates on the branch and the items that are branching     |
| [29:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1797.16) | off of that branch and they allow you to access the index of an element as part of its selection. |
| [30:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1802.22) | So these pseudo classes are keywords essentially for, you know, saying item zero or if you're     |
| [30:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1806.96) | in array, right, it'd be like the first item or the last item would be the end of the array.      |
| [30:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1810.92) | And they're just keywords, nice legible references to common indexes.                             |
| [30:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1814.8)  | First last and only kind of sweet.                                                                |
| [30:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1817.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [30:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1818.2)  | There's also first of type and last of type.                                                      |
| [30:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1820.2)  | So these are similar to first child and last child, except the pseudo class looks for all         |
| [30:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1825.08) | of a type of element you are applying it on within a group of sibling elements.                   |
| [30:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1829.52) | So for example, if you had a paragraph and within that paragraph you had three span elements      |
| [30:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1833.76) | and a strong element, if you wrote span colon first of type, only the first span would get        |
| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1838.52) | the style applied.                                                                                |
| [30:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1839.56) | The other two would not.                                                                          |
| [30:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1840.92) | And vice versa for last of type, that would just be from the back side of it.                     |
| [30:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1845.88) | The last one would get the styling.                                                               |
| [30:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1847.72) | I have used first of type on my blog website to target all the paragraphs within an article       |
| [30:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1853.16) | to style the first paragraph a little bit differently than the rest.                              |
| [30:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1855.44) | It's kind of like an intro paragraph.                                                             |
| [30:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1856.76) | So that was nice use of CSS for first of type for me.                                             |
| [31:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1860.36) | Yeah, I like those first type and last type.                                                      |
| [31:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1862.12) | I generally find those are what I use instead of nth child or first child.                        |
| [31:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1866.84) | Well, it depends on what you're trying to target, but yeah.                                       |
| [31:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1868.96) | Yeah, it depends on what you're trying to target.                                                 |
| [31:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1870.28) | And usually I guess I'm being pretty specific about what I'm targeting and making sure it's       |
| [31:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1874.32) | a type.                                                                                           |
| [31:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1875.32) | I don't know, it seems to be nice.                                                                |
| [31:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1876.68) | Anyway, so I use that one all the time.                                                           |
| [31:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1877.68) | I think it's awesome.                                                                             |
| [31:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1878.9)  | So then we also have nth child and nth last child.                                                |
| [31:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1882.1)  | So these get a little tricky, nth child.                                                          |
| [31:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1883.96) | So again, we're working against a list with this contextual pseudo class and these allow          |
| [31:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1888.94) | you to access the index of an element as part of its selection.                                   |
| [31:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1891.84) | So very literally the index.                                                                      |
| [31:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1893.08) | These aren't keywords into indexes.                                                               |
| [31:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1895.04) | This is with a number at its basic usage.                                                         |
| [31:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1898.22) | So you could say nth child one or nth child two and target literally that index child.            |
| [31:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1902.7)  | But there's some superpowers in here.                                                             |
| [31:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1904.96) | It's actually a little mini syntax.                                                               |
| [31:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1906.68) | So check it out.                                                                                  |
| [31:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1907.8)  | So okay, these are nth child open parentheses, closed parentheses.                                |
| [31:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1910.8)  | Now I'm not going to go into this, but the little micro syntax that you have in here              |
| [31:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1913.52) | is called the A and B micro syntax.                                                               |
| [31:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1916.64) | A like a capital A lowercase n plus capital B.                                                    |
| [32:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1920.14) | Anyway, okay, so that's just the name of the syntax.                                              |
| [32:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1922.72) | And it's kind of cool.                                                                            |
| [32:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1923.72) | It's called a micro syntax.                                                                       |
| [32:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1924.72) | I've never heard that before.                                                                     |
| [32:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1925.72) | Anyway, I think we should do a whole episode on this micro syntax because it's that crazy.        |
| [32:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1928.96) | Yeah, because it's pretty involved.                                                               |
| [32:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1930.36) | It's pretty involved.                                                                             |
| [32:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1931.36) | Okay, so what's it used for?                                                                      |
| [32:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1932.66) | The idea is to easily indicate single elements or all elements at regularly spaced intervals      |
| [32:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1938.14) | in a list, right?                                                                                 |
| [32:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1939.4)  | So like the first use case is zebra striping.                                                     |
| [32:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1941.4)  | If you're looking at a data grid where you want a regular interval of index selection,            |
| [32:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1945.32) | usually like every other one.                                                                     |
| [32:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1947.5)  | So you can say every other row has this background of like a light blue.                          |
| [32:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1951.58) | And now you have this nice zebra striping of your grid for free, which is this one pseudo         |
| [32:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1955.66) | class functional selector here with a little bit of micro syntax.                                 |
| [32:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1959.88) | So anyway, we're going to cover that micro syntax more, but just know that it's used              |
| [32:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1962.62) | to help you find regularly spaced intervals in a list.                                            |
| [32:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1965.86) | And I've seen people do crazy stuff with this for flexbox and it's amazing.                       |
| [32:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1970.14) | So anyway, a lot of power here in nth child that we're going to breeze over and yeah,             |
| [32:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1973.84) | we'll cover it later.                                                                             |
| [32:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1974.84) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [32:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1975.84) | So let's go nth of type and nth last of type.                                                     |
| [32:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1978.58) | So these are similar to nth child and nth last child, except these again are targeting            |
| [33:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1982.3)  | a type of element within a group of siblings.                                                     |
| [33:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1985.0)  | So you could do like p nth of type one and you get the same thing as the first of type            |
| [33:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1990.9)  | targeting only that first paragraph.                                                              |
| [33:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1992.34) | Or you can use that a n plus b micro syntax and write something like p nth of type two            |
| [33:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=1996.78) | n plus one and target all the odd paragraphs.                                                     |
| [33:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2000.02) | This would be different than a regular nth child because nth child targets all children           |
| [33:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2005.26) | within a parent, but nth of type would skip the non typed children that are not of that           |
| [33:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2010.0)  | element type, removing them from the style stack.                                                 |
| [33:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2013.42) | So say you had a bunch of paragraphs with divs interspersed, which would happen if you            |
| [33:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2018.04) | had an article and ads sprinkled throughout the article like a lot of media websites have,        |
| [33:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2022.5)  | but you wanted the paragraph pattern to continue uninterrupted, then you would use the nth        |
| [33:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2026.7)  | of type.                                                                                          |
| [33:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2027.78) | And last of type would be from the opposite side.                                                 |
| [33:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2030.24) | Also should have mentioned this earlier, but colon only of type is similar to only child,         |
| [33:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2035.06) | which styles an element if it's the only element of that type within the context that you're      |
| [33:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2039.46) | targeting.                                                                                        |
| [34:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2040.46) | So for example, if you have an email app with one message left, you can style based on selecting  |
| [34:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2044.26) | its type and get the user excited for inbox zero.                                                 |
| [34:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2047.98) | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [34:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2048.98) | Very cool.                                                                                        |
| [34:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2049.98) | No, great example there.                                                                          |
| [34:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2051.22) | The last one we have here is colon scope.                                                         |
| [34:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2054.5)  | Colon scope.                                                                                      |
| [34:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2055.5)  | So this one is like a, there's a modern version of this that we'll get into in a second that's    |
| [34:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2058.5)  | got a hot topic on it, but the colon scope that we're referencing, at least in this episode       |
| [34:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2063.18) | for right now is old.                                                                             |
| [34:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2065.26) | It's supported in Chrome 27 and Safari seven and safe to say your browser has this pseudo         |
| [34:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2070.46) | class, but this is not in your CSS.                                                               |
| [34:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2073.98) | It's only been available for JavaScript through query selector.                                   |
| [34:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2077.56) | So in JavaScript, in order to query the children of an already selected element, like let's       |
| [34:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2081.46) | say I grabbed the nav and then I want to grab all the links inside of a nav, the scope CSS        |
| [34:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2085.9)  | pseudo selector must be present or else the query is still done against the document.             |
| [34:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2090.66) | It's kind of like your way to emulate jQuery dot find.                                            |
| [34:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2093.22) | I don't know if you ever use that, but anyway, the syntax is like context.                        |
| [34:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2096.82) | So like let's say it's my nav.                                                                    |
| [34:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2097.98) | I'd be like nav dot query selector, open parentheses.                                             |
| [35:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2102.3)  | And then my string of my CSS selector there, I would write colon scope and then I'd do            |
| [35:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2106.78) | space anchor.                                                                                     |
| [35:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2107.78) | So that in order for me to grab all the anchors inside of my nav, I have to tell it that the      |
| [35:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2111.98) | scope is against the node that I'm querying selector on.                                          |
| [35:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2115.38) | It's a little tricky, but once you get the syntax in there, it's no big deal, but it's            |
| [35:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2118.82) | kind of interesting the pseudo classes this ancient and it kind of serves a good purpose.         |
| [35:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2123.14) | I've used this in my applications like VisBug uses this.                                          |
| [35:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2125.74) | I've actually never heard of this one, but it's really interesting to learn about.                |
| [35:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2129.38) | Yeah, awesome.                                                                                    |
| [35:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2130.38) | And there's more that we can get into in web components where scope is trying to actually         |
| [35:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2133.62) | scope your styles.                                                                                |
| [35:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2134.86) | So we'll have a new use case for it coming up in CSS.                                             |
| [35:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQ23OfgIMUsrJ4iuV9mG5?&t=2137.7)  | It's kind of exciting.                                                                            |
