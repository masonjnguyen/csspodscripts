| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.                   |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=16.84)   | Today we're continuing our CSS Houdini series and entering worklet land.                                   |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=22.52)   | Ooh, entering worklet land.                                                                                |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=25.2)    | And the worklet of the day is the Paint worklet, also known as the CSS Painting API.                       |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=32.36)   | This API enables developers to define canvas-like custom painting functions that can be used               |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=37.96)   | directly in CSS as backgrounds, borders, masks, and more.                                                  |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=43.4)    | But before we dive into the Painting API and Paint worklets specifically, let's go over                    |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=48.76)   | what a worklet is and how it pertains to CSS Houdini.                                                      |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=52.12)   | Yes, a brief, hopefully brief, intro to worklets and web workers.                                          |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=56.2)    | So a worklet, other than like a fun word to say, is the most succinct form of like a self-contained        |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=61.88)   | module with a function that returns a canvas.                                                              |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=64.96)   | So I'm defining right now worklet, not a worker.                                                           |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=68.16)   | So a worklet is a self-contained module with a function that returns a painted canvas.                     |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=72.32)   | So that's like it at its most succinct level.                                                              |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=74.78)   | But also it's a class that implements a specific interface so that it can customize an element.            |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=79.34)   | So there's a formal API and handshake between the engine and your worklet.                                 |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=83.88)   | And it's important that these are self-contained so that they can run off the main thread.                 |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=87.72)   | So let's compare them with a web worker, which also runs off the main thread.                              |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=91.36)   | All worklets are workers, but not all workers are worklets.                                                |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=96.0)    | Worklets are just more specific workers.                                                                   |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=97.76)   | So a worker, at least to me, is one that is like more generalized, a name for the idea                     |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=102.92)  | like workers exist in more than just JavaScript and the web, and they exist on servers.                    |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=107.64)  | And it's like I said, a generic idea.                                                                      |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=110.24)  | Worklets to me are scripts that have a very tight and limited contract between the script                  |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=114.0)   | and the application created them.                                                                          |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=115.36)  | So something so tight, it's only allowed to pass strings, nothing richer type.                             |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=119.2)   | So like workers can be really, really limited in the hope that they can do something really,               |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=123.44)  | really powerful.                                                                                           |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=125.12)  | Worklet scripts are always invoked in their own sandbox with their allocated compute power.                |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=129.7)   | So workers and worklets get executed in a sort of constrained little sandbox, like I                       |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=134.56)  | said.                                                                                                      |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=135.56)  | So they're so small that they can be created and destroyed very quickly.                                   |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=138.88)  | And they can't affect anything outside of them.                                                            |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=140.82)  | So they can be trusted to sort of be given some materials and some tools, use those materials              |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=145.32)  | and tools and then return something outside of that.                                                       |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=148.08)  | And they never leak outside of that play space.                                                            |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=149.96)  | It's really important that workers and worklets or just the concept of a worker doesn't leak               |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=154.08)  | any work outside of its play space.                                                                        |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=156.08)  | So both of these need to be served and run on a secure server using HTTPS.                                 |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=160.18)  | So that's a rule that's more specific for web workers.                                                     |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=163.26)  | But it's still nice to think about serving these things securely so that these workers                     |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=166.92)  | don't get given, well, they could be given tools and instructions and perform a task                       |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=171.52)  | on them and not know that they did something bad.                                                          |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=173.6)   | So anyway, it's nice that these are secure.                                                                |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=175.2)   | So asking scripts to be served securely helps filter out bad actors.                                       |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=178.92)  | We're running scripts inside the browser engine now too.                                                   |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=181.24)  | So you want to be secure.                                                                                  |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=183.32)  | We want to have those worklets come from somewhere safe.                                                   |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=186.36)  | Worklets they offer help to the application by taking work to another place that's not                     |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=189.84)  | busy.                                                                                                      |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=190.84)  | This is kind of what we mean by off the main thread.                                                       |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=192.78)  | Your sandbox is not just protected.                                                                        |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=194.62)  | It's clearing up an otherwise busy space where that we call the main thread.                               |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=197.92)  | So you can think about your application gets loaded and it's almost like a highway and                     |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=202.04)  | all the scripts and CSS and HTML and JS are all on that same freeway trying to do work.                    |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=206.84)  | And sometimes it gets clogged.                                                                             |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=208.44)  | And what workers do and worklets is they can move work onto a side highway.                                |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=212.96)  | And so both of these roads can be filled with cars and activity and they aren't stomping                   |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=218.04)  | on each other.                                                                                             |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=219.04)  | They're logging the main freeway less by running more things on these side highways.                       |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=223.12)  | So being self-contained, they're easy to create and destroy.                                               |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=226.04)  | So it's not uncommon to deploy a hundred worklets across a hundred threads to attack a big problem.        |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=230.98)  | It's pretty much what GPUs do.                                                                             |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=232.52)  | They take all this work that's humongous.                                                                  |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=234.44)  | They separate it up into a bunch of little pieces and they send it to these independent                    |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=237.72)  | worker threads to get a big job done in a small amount of time.                                            |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=241.76)  | So workers, they can be found on the web.                                                                  |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=243.4)   | They can be found in native languages and server languages and more.                                       |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=246.34)  | It's just this generic idea around functions that do big or secure operations alone on                     |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=251.46)  | an island.                                                                                                 |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=252.56)  | So today we're focused on paint worklets, which is exactly like this metaphor.                             |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=257.08)  | The browser is going to forward the request found in the CSS for a background paint job                    |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=260.8)   | from a custom Houdini worklet.                                                                             |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=262.76)  | That worklet will run in its own thread, helping out the main thread and keeping it free to                |

| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=267.72)  | And it will return a painted canvas for the browser to use.                                                |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=271.44)  | Secure, fast, custom paint jobs off the main thread.                                                       |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=275.0)   | I hope that taught you a little bit about workers and worklets.                                            |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=277.6)   | Yeah, definitely, Adam.                                                                                    |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=278.6)   | That was a great explanation about workers, worklets and all of those important things.                    |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=284.08)  | When I first started working with paint worklets, I didn't understand why I had to use paint               |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=288.88)  | worklets only using HTTPS or localhost.                                                                    |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=293.48)  | And sort of your explanation of why there are security issues there to make sure that                      |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=297.76)  | they are secure totally explains that.                                                                     |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=300.32)  | So that's another like gotcha and caveat for if you are working with Houdini worklets and                  |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=304.16)  | you're not used to those considerations, you have to keep that in mind.                                    |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=308.84)  | Also, if you're opening a worklet locally, you have to run a server so that you can actually               |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=314.16)  | see that worklet running on a thread instead of having it just be a static file.                           |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=319.04)  | That is something that was also like a little gotcha when I first started playing with this.               |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=323.08)  | When I pulled down, there's a Google Chrome labs repo with a bunch of demos on there.                      |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=327.88)  | You can't just open a file and expect it to read a worklet.                                                |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=330.32)  | You have to be running a server.                                                                           |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=331.32)  | So you could do like a local like Python server and just run that and then you could open                  |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=335.4)   | the directory through like localhost and see your worklets.                                                |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=338.88)  | Yep, good tip.                                                                                             |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=339.88)  | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=340.88)  | If you wanted to use a paint worklet in your code, there's a few steps and things you need                 |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=344.72)  | to do.                                                                                                     |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=345.72)  | First, you have to write the worklet and you use register paint.                                           |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=348.84)  | That's a function register paint.                                                                          |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=350.28)  | You give it a name within that function.                                                                   |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=351.76)  | That's the first argument.                                                                                 |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=352.84)  | And then you have the class inside of that where you are writing the worklet code, the                     |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=357.76)  | things that are going to be calling paint or like your work area, your class, the information              |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=361.84)  | of the worklets.                                                                                           |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=363.08)  | So within that area, typically use this class structure, and then you can pull in custom                   |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=368.7)   | properties or input arguments or other things to use within your worklet in an organized                   |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=373.84)  | way.                                                                                                       |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=374.84)  | And you can then write your custom arguments.                                                              |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=378.2)   | So we'll have more a bit on that coming up, but once you've written your logic inside                      |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=383.04)  | your worklets, you then register the worklet on the CSS interface in JavaScript using css.paintworklet.add |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=390.64)  | module, and then you link to the worklet file.                                                             |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=393.84)  | So you're linking to that file to add to the CSS interface using paintworklet.add module.                  |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=398.58)  | If you were using a different type of worklet, you could write layout worklet or animation                 |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=401.4)   | worklet.add module.                                                                                        |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=402.68)  | But the idea here is that you need to register this module and then you can use it in your                 |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=405.96)  | CSS.                                                                                                       |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=407.02)  | So now we have your page, your product, your website registering this worklet.                             |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=413.88)  | It's a part of the flow.                                                                                   |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=416.0)   | Now you can actually use it in CSS.                                                                        |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=418.3)   | So you can say background paint rainbows or background paint rainbows, arguments, and                      |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=425.04)  | actually use it in your CSS.                                                                               |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=426.68)  | So this is if the rainbows was like the name of the worklets.                                              |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=429.12)  | You'll be using the worklet name here.                                                                     |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=430.64)  | And as I mentioned earlier, this doesn't have to just be a background.                                     |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=432.8)   | You could use it as a border image.                                                                        |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=434.34)  | You could use it really anywhere where you would otherwise use CSS.                                        |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=437.56)  | I'm going to make a worklet called double rainbow OMG.                                                     |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=441.12)  | Well, maybe I'll make it called rainbow with a parameter of how many rainbows do you want?                 |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=446.44)  | Do you want a double rainbow, a triple?                                                                    |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=447.96)  | Okay, anyway, this joke is getting lame.                                                                   |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=449.36)  | It was funny for a second.                                                                                 |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=451.16)  | Maybe.                                                                                                     |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=452.16)  | I like where your head's at.                                                                               |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=453.16)  | All right.                                                                                                 |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=454.16)  | Well, okay.                                                                                                |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=455.16)  | So that was an excellent usage overview.                                                                   |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=458.04)  | It is a little tricky because the worklet registers itself and then gets loaded by another                 |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=462.08)  | file and then the CSS eventually reaches that worklet.                                                     |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=464.98)  | It can be confusing.                                                                                       |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=466.52)  | That's kind of why we've broken up these episodes into different sections so that we can talk              |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=469.8)   | about them specifically.                                                                                   |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=470.8)   | And so, yeah, today is about paint and this worklet and the stuff that can happen inside                   |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=474.44)  | of there.                                                                                                  |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=475.44)  | And you mentioned the register paint function.                                                             |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=477.16)  | So that is living inside of our worklet.                                                                   |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=479.56)  | We give it a name inside of there and like you said, pass the class.                                       |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=482.64)  | So there's a paint function on that class.                                                                 |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=485.26)  | That's pretty much the only mandatory interface that your class must implement and it will                 |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=490.0)   | receive four delightful parameters.                                                                        |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=493.02)  | The first one is context.                                                                                  |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=495.06)  | The second one is the geometry, the size, the third one is properties and the fourth                       |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=498.36)  | one is arguments.                                                                                          |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=499.54)  | So let's break down each of these really quick.                                                            |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=501.9)   | And Yuna, tell us what is context?                                                                         |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=503.86)  | Why would my paint function be receiving a context?                                                        |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=506.84)  | Yes.                                                                                                       |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=507.84)  | So context is super useful.                                                                                |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=508.84)  | It's the context of the element itself.                                                                    |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=511.68)  | So current color, for example, would be the ability to pull the current color, like understand             |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=517.96)  | what the color is, the paint is in CSS.                                                                    |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=520.88)  | So in the same way, when you're writing a worklet, you need the context to be able to                      |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=524.92)  | actually paint to the canvas within the context of the element.                                            |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=529.32)  | So it's sort of akin to like the JavaScript canvas element where you're doing canvas.getContext2D.         |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=535.44)  | This gives you full access to the same APIs found on the canvas context.                                   |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=538.88)  | So if you were to draw something, for example, you would draw it to the context.                           |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=543.8)   | You do like context.fill or within the context you could use, well, size is the next one,                  |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=549.24)  | but you would use context within size to get information and then to apply information                     |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=554.08)  | onto the element.                                                                                          |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=555.44)  | So I guess context is kind of like this in a way.                                                          |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=559.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=560.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=561.96)  | You're using like this.                                                                                    |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=562.96)  | I want to apply to this.                                                                                   |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=563.96)  | I think of context too as it's like the actual canvas.                                                     |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=567.32)  | It's like there's the canvas idea and then it's like, no, no, no, I want the piece of                      |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=571.2)   | paper.                                                                                                     |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=572.2)   | Can you give me the piece of paper for the idea of a canvas?                                               |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=575.36)  | Anyway, maybe that's not as good as a mental model as yours.                                               |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=578.48)  | This stuff's hard.                                                                                         |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=579.6)   | I want to point out too that that context object is the same one that you would get                        |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=583.28)  | in canvas and you do have the opportunity to change properties on it, just like a regular                  |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=587.48)  | canvas.                                                                                                    |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=588.48)  | And so I have this idea that as soon as canvas can support additional color spaces like displayP3,         |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=593.4)   | which I think canvas is going to get the ability to paint these colors faster than CSS proper.             |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=598.68)  | So I could make a Houdini paint worklet that changes the canvas context color space to                     |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=604.2)   | displayP3 and then draw colors in that better color space and return that canvas back to                   |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=609.32)  | CSS and maybe teach Chrome how to draw displayP3 colors.                                                   |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=612.52)  | I don't know.                                                                                              |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=613.52)  | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=614.52)  | Well, the way that you use it is like canvas.                                                              |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=616.04)  | So I'm trying to describe it as this, but with canvas it's also like this.                                 |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=620.4)   | So if you do like a line with stroke color and then actually like a path, you have to                      |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=626.28)  | do context.lineWith context.strokeStyle.                                                                   |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=629.8)   | And then you would do context.beginPath, moveTo lineTo and then stroke.                                    |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=634.36)  | You do context.stroke and that's what actually paints onto your canvas or your context.                    |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=640.12)  | It is just like canvas.                                                                                    |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=641.56)  | That's probably a better connection.                                                                       |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=642.92)  | I think you just really cleared it up there because it's almost like you have the paper                    |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=646.12)  | and then you have to put a pen to it and the context is like the combination of the paper                  |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=649.88)  | and the pen together and then you move that.                                                               |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=651.88)  | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                          |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=652.88)  | Maybe that's getting weirder.                                                                              |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=654.08)  | Let's move on to geometry and size, which is the second parameter.                                         |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=657.88)  | Yep.                                                                                                       |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=658.88)  | Nice.                                                                                                      |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=659.88)  | And geometry and size, they're exactly what they sound like.                                               |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=661.28)  | They're the height and width of the element and it's an object with keys.                                  |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=664.36)  | So you have a nice little API into these values, which is nice.                                            |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=667.96)  | So next we have props or properties and this is a great way to actually customize your                     |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=673.86)  | custom functions, your paint worklets, if you will.                                                        |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=677.5)   | So the way that this works is you could pull in input properties, which are custom properties              |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=682.96)  | from your CSS and use them as values to customize your worklet.                                            |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=689.6)   | So for example, I might want to use custom properties to set the color or the number                       |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=694.66)  | of something or even like a custom identifier as an input property to specify styles within                |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=702.26)  | my worklet.                                                                                                |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=703.26)  | I could use that as a fill style, as a color stroke style, whatever I want there.                          |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=708.82)  | So the way that you get those values is you do static get input properties and this is                     |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=712.96)  | a function and then it returns an array of input properties that you want to get.                          |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=717.92)  | So if I had like one of the worklets that I built is super underline.                                      |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=723.0)   | So it lets you put as many underlines as you want, not just one underline, but multiple                    |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=727.16)  | underlines and it gets a underline number, underline color, underline spread, which is                     |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=732.84)  | the distance between the first and last underline, the space in which it can draw and then underline       |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=736.88)  | width.                                                                                                     |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=737.88)  | So within the input properties function, I'm returning each of these custom variables,                     |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=744.6)   | custom properties in a string.                                                                             |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=746.4)   | So that way I can read from the CSS document and then use those values inside of my function,              |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=753.72)  | inside of my paint function.                                                                               |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=755.56)  | So once I am calling that I want to get those static get input properties, returning the                   |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=760.88)  | string, I could then in the paint function say to use those properties via properties.get                  |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=767.6)   | and then that.get is now the ability to get from that properties object the value of my                    |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=774.76)  | underline number, for example.                                                                             |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=776.76)  | So when I'm using this, I'm usually parsing it, I'm using parseInt and then I'm using                      |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=780.36)  | that as a numeric value.                                                                                   |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=782.18)  | But also if you are registering custom properties inside of your JavaScript separately of the              |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=787.12)  | worklet, you can get fallback values, you can get syntax, you get a lot of really nice                     |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=791.88)  | benefits when you are doing that as well as using these paint worklets.                                    |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=797.44)  | So they work really well in unison.                                                                        |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=799.8)   | Hopefully that was a clear explanation of how you use and get input properties, but                        |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=804.68)  | they are super, super useful.                                                                              |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=806.76)  | I use these for pretty much all of the custom paint worklets that I write.                                 |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=811.86)  | Properties and arguments just really allow for two different modalities of entry for                       |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=815.02)  | customizing your paint worklets.                                                                           |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=820.4)   | It's pizza night.                                                                                          |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=821.4)   | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=822.4)   | All right.                                                                                                 |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=825.28)  | Well done on the properties.                                                                               |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=826.78)  | I like to think of them as like, here's a list of props I want and it'll call my function                  |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=832.2)   | and I'll say there might be a hundred props on that element and I'm only interested in                     |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=835.66)  | this funky, like I had a static gradient size or something like that.                                      |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=839.28)  | So I like that the filter function is like an explicit way for you to say, these are                       |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=842.56)  | the only props I want.                                                                                     |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=843.56)  | Don't give me every prop for this element.                                                                 |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=845.48)  | Anyway, sometimes I also think that feels like a weird step in the props flow, but it                      |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=849.92)  | makes sense.                                                                                               |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=850.92)  | Args doesn't have that requirement.                                                                        |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=852.76)  | It also comes in a little bit more raw.                                                                    |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=854.68)  | So this is the fourth parameter of your paint function.                                                    |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=857.4)   | And this is if someone wants to call your function with parameters.                                        |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=861.28)  | So instead of putting custom properties above their usage of this paint worklet, like if                   |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=865.04)  | they did background paint rainbow, they would open that up parentheses, say paint rainbow                  |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=870.4)   | and parentheses.                                                                                           |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=871.72)  | And that is not including any arguments because they'd be in properties.                                   |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=874.8)   | So if you did paint and then comma and you pass like all these sizes or however many                       |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=878.86)  | number of sparkles you want or all these options, you can pass them functionally.                          |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=883.12)  | But those have some advantages and some disadvantages.                                                     |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=885.8)   | And one of the advantages is that you can call multiple versions of that paint function                    |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=889.8)   | on your border image and your background image and that sort of stuff.                                     |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=892.68)  | And they each get different values.                                                                        |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=894.92)  | Whereas if you use custom properties, each one of those paint implementations, like each                   |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=898.66)  | time that paint comes back, they're referencing the same properties.                                       |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=902.14)  | So they have to share their parameters with a custom property scenario and with arguments,                 |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=906.12)  | you can give each background image its unique arguments that go into this paint work.                      |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=910.96)  | So that's how I like to think about the difference between those two.                                      |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=914.32)  | And they're both really important.                                                                         |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=915.52)  | I think there's a push and a pull here and it's almost like a user experience, like an                     |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=919.04)  | authoring workflow that you get to create for other engineers that use your worklet.                       |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=923.84)  | And so I got to do, we talked about in one of the last episodes that you can create your                   |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=927.4)   | own little syntaxes for how people interact with your worklets.                                            |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=930.16)  | And so I liked using the words small, medium and large and stuff like nice human legible                   |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=935.56)  | words so they don't have to be like, what does to mean?                                                    |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=937.96)  | They can just say small and yeah, it's cool stuff.                                                         |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=940.24)  | I also find pros and cons to each of these approaches.                                                     |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=944.44)  | So for example, if you wanted to use a input value, whether that's properties or arguments,                |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=950.6)   | and you wanted that to update based on where you were applying it, you could always use                    |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=954.18)  | locally scoped CSS custom properties and overwrite a value.                                                |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=958.74)  | But if you wanted to use the same worklet in two different ways within the same element,                   |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=965.28)  | you can't do that.                                                                                         |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=966.64)  | So I ran into this when I was creating a paint worklet that allowed for you to do angled                   |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=972.64)  | borders.                                                                                                   |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=973.64)  | So instead of angled sort of cut corners is what I mean to say, the cut corners.                           |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=977.64)  | So in order to really have the cut corners effect, I needed to apply a clipping mask                       |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=982.08)  | to a element, so say a button, so that if you interact with that button and you have                       |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=986.68)  | like an animation, it wouldn't extend past that clipped area.                                              |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=990.2)   | But I also wanted to use a border.                                                                         |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=992.8)   | So I wanted to then also draw the border.                                                                  |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=995.32)  | If I just had a regular border applied to this element, it would get cut off by the                        |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=999.6)   | clipping mask.                                                                                             |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1000.6)  | You wouldn't see that angled part of the border because it would just cut that off.                        |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1003.76) | It wouldn't paint it.                                                                                      |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1004.98) | So I needed to paint it as a border image and I needed to use it as a clipping, like                       |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1009.88) | a mask on the element.                                                                                     |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1011.82) | So the only way to achieve this was through arguments, where I had one of the arguments                    |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1015.12) | be a mode, which is a custom identifier, that mode, which set if I wanted it to be a filled                |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1020.56) | or outlined modality of the same worklet, I was able to use the same worklet for both                      |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1025.3)  | properties inside of the same element and called it twice.                                                 |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1028.48) | Oh, smooth.                                                                                                |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1029.48) | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1030.48) | So it was a requirement in that case to use arguments because otherwise I wouldn't be                      |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1033.96) | able to change the mode and use it in two places in the same space and the same element.                   |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1039.04) | Yeah, I love it.                                                                                           |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1040.36) | You're pretty much employing them both for their best features.                                            |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1043.0)  | Yeah.                                                                                                      |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1044.0)  | Very cool.                                                                                                 |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1045.0)  | I hadn't thought about using it that way.                                                                  |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1046.0)  | I kind of had been writing both worklets.                                                                  |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1048.24) | Like I would write a worklet that used arguments and then I was like, well, I'll just pivot                |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1051.92) | this one really easy to using properties as well.                                                          |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1054.28) | And then folks can choose, I guess.                                                                        |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1056.12) | Right.                                                                                                     |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1057.12) | So an example of something that I saw Adam build was the static gradient and then a powdered               |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1060.24) | gradient or one of them was squares and one of them was circles.                                           |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1063.24) | It creates like frosty effect with the circles and with the static gradient, it was like                   |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1067.38) | a pixelated effect.                                                                                        |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1069.26) | So the thing that you could do there is have an option for the type of effect as a custom                  |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1073.9)  | identifier and only write one worklet.                                                                     |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1076.32) | And then you could have the user choose because they had a lot of shared property values,                  |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1080.36) | which was size, color, et cetera.                                                                          |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1081.98) | The only difference was the type of it was rounded or square.                                              |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1085.12) | So that is an example of like where you can use arguments.                                                 |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1088.84) | It's also, as Adam mentioned, user preference in a lot of situations, but specifically in                  |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1094.48) | the case that I described, you had to use arguments.                                                       |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1097.64) | Now another con to using arguments is that most of the things that you do with a paint                     |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1102.68) | worklet are polyfillable using the CSS paint polyfill by our teammate Jason Miller, but                    |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1108.44) | arguments are not yet polyfillable.                                                                        |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1110.48) | They do not work with the CSS paint polyfill.                                                              |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1113.72) | So if you wrote a worklet today, I would recommend using input properties, custom properties               |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1118.94) | over input arguments just for that cross browser capability.                                               |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1123.36) | And they're animatable.                                                                                    |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1124.6)  | So right, you can update a custom property in a loop or in a transition or whatever,                       |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1129.28) | and you can teach Houdini to listen to those and the arguments are not going to be animatable.             |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1134.6)  | That is a good point.                                                                                      |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1135.6)  | I didn't even think of that.                                                                               |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1137.94) | That's why we're here together because I don't think of all the stuff you think of and that's              |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1142.08) | awesome.                                                                                                   |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1143.08) | The next thing that you can use in here is called a style map, which is now actually                       |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1146.0)  | a part of the element API, but it's another way that you can interact with your paint                      |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1149.4)  | worklets.                                                                                                  |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1150.8)  | So what you could do is you can get context options.                                                       |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1153.94) | So for example, if you wanted to see if there was opacity applied, you could check for alpha.              |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1160.64) | So you could do like get static context options, return alpha true.                                        |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1164.46) | And I think that that's really interesting because it can help you make styling decisions                  |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1167.4)  | based on the context of the element.                                                                       |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1170.0)  | I haven't taken advantage of this yet, but I thought that it was pretty interesting.                       |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1174.32) | Yeah, that does sound cool.                                                                                |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1175.88) | You can also update a style map inside of a request animation frame within a painter.                      |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1182.48) | For example, you could update like the underlying number or a sparkle number or a confetti number.         |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1188.84) | These are just examples of paint worklets I built using request animation frame and                        |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1192.88) | then within that a function that sets a custom property value on your style map.                           |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1198.64) | So as Adam was saying, you couldn't do this with arguments, but you can do it if you're                    |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1202.36) | updating a custom property which lives at the scope that you set it and usually at root                    |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1207.76) | scope, but you could update it within any elements and kind of go down the cascade.                        |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1211.76) | So another way to do this would be just using your custom properties in a CSS at key frames                |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1217.56) | animation.                                                                                                 |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1218.56) | You don't have to necessarily do it within a request animation frame, but if you're doing                  |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1221.76) | that within the worklet, I think it makes sense since you're already writing JavaScript                    |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1224.44) | to do the request animation frame.                                                                         |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1226.2)  | If it's just an option in your CSS, then you can do it through CSS.                                        |
| [20:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1230.44) | There's definitely like a thing to note here with using random inside of your animations.                  |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1237.08) | I've definitely done this because I like the effect of having like random sparkles and                     |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1240.76) | like random backgrounds, but it could cause some weirdness if you're expecting to have                     |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1247.16) | a background be consistent.                                                                                |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1249.86) | So for example, that randomization when you're placing sparkles, those random sparkles will                |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1256.06) | change position as you resize the page.                                                                    |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1258.68) | Or if you're typing within that element, if you have like a content editable element                       |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1262.16) | and you're updating the text content within it, it will change because you're repainting                   |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1266.8)  | as you're typing.                                                                                          |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1267.8)  | So if you wanted a randomized effect, you could seed your values instead of doing a                        |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1272.28) | true random, but it really depends on what effect you're sort of going for.                                |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1275.88) | Yeah, it's basically paint flashing visualized for you without turning on paint flashing.                  |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1281.68) | And so if you don't know what paint flashing is, this is something you can go into your                    |
| [21:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1283.98) | dev tool settings and enable and it will show you what is currently being painted every                    |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1288.12) | frame over and over again.                                                                                 |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1289.48) | So you can know if there's anything expensive, like an animation that's painting every frame,              |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1293.4)  | right?                                                                                                     |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1294.4)  | You're watching it rotate a GIF is painting every frame, but your paint work lit, like                     |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1298.68) | when it paints once, it's not going to sit there and flash.                                                |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1301.9)  | But if you try to highlight the text or you mess with other properties that change the                     |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1305.88) | paint and bounds of that element, you'll watch your paint work lit change because you used                 |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1311.0)  | random and it painted again and it painted something new.                                                  |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1313.96) | And so, yeah, there is a gotcha here with random that you might end up continually creating                |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1318.84) | a new paint background every time the paint flashes and a way around that is with a seeded                 |
| [22:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1324.12) | value.                                                                                                     |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1325.12) | Yeah, this was Jake Archibald brought this up as deterministic paint worklets.                             |
| [22:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1328.64) | He was like, I think they should be deterministic.                                                         |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1330.68) | And we were like, but we're using math random everywhere.                                                  |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1333.72) | Anyway, so it was really fun conversation.                                                                 |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1336.0)  | I'm glad you brought that up.                                                                              |
| [22:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1337.28) | Well, what are some examples of Houdini paint?                                                             |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1339.4)  | Like you've mentioned a couple you have got your you cut corners, you know, you're just                    |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1342.8)  | a corner cutter.                                                                                           |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1344.0)  | But what else?                                                                                             |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1345.0)  | What other examples do you have?                                                                           |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1346.0)  | I've done like scalloped borders, which is fun to sort of calculate the scallops like,                     |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1350.08) | you know, when you're doing like little half circles around some text.                                     |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1352.88) | Oh, yeah, like a doily.                                                                                    |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1353.88) | Yeah, like a doily.                                                                                        |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1354.88) | I know what a doily is.                                                                                    |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1355.88) | So when I first started really playing with paint worklets, I gave a talk and it was based                 |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1360.96) | on Ariana Grande's song Thank You Next, which had like a theme of like, Mean Girls, like                   |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1367.2)  | the burn book.                                                                                             |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1368.2)  | And I was just thinking a lot about like, drawing and text.                                                |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1370.68) | And I thought of that like the scallop borders, like the doilies sort of.                                  |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1374.12) | So yeah, that was one.                                                                                     |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1375.42) | And then I had like the extra underline with like all the underlines.                                      |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1377.72) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1378.72) | Those are both inspired by Ariana Grande.                                                                  |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1381.72) | And I've also played around with a few different background styles like sparkles and confetti.             |
| [23:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1388.24) | I launched a library called extra.css that looked into how you could quickly and easily                    |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1394.08) | get started with Houdini worklets with like a single import statement.                                     |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1398.08) | And our team has also been working on another great launch to help you get started with                    |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1403.28) | cross browser paint worklets that will probably be out by the time that you listen to this                 |
| [23:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1408.56) | podcast if you're listening to it after next week when it launches, which will be after                    |

| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1477.16) | So I posted my worklet somewhere and people were like, Hey, that looks like a rhizograph.                  |
| [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1480.44) | And I'm like, Oh, I should know what that means.                                                           |
| [24:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1482.72) | And I went, I looked it up and it's that graphic art print style that looks very grungy, but               |
| [24:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1487.32) | it's pointillism grungy.                                                                                   |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1488.92) | So it's almost like they have these gradients of powder.                                                   |
| [24:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1490.84) | And I was like, this is very similar to what I made.                                                       |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1493.16) | So I'd love to see some more rhizographs.                                                                  |
| [24:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1494.92) | I'm a big grunge fan.                                                                                      |
| [24:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1496.24) | I did so much grunge websites back in the day.                                                             |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1498.92) | I mean, one of my first websites I worked for was a action sports DVD distribution company.                |
| [25:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1502.98) | I don't think we've talked about that before.                                                              |
| [25:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1504.68) | Anyway, had grunge everywhere.                                                                             |
| [25:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1506.48) | It was the grunge king website, I think.                                                                   |
| [25:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1508.84) | But yeah, anything with like grain or noise, these are things in Photoshop that were really                |
| [25:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1511.96) | popular to kind of create organic randomness as you would start with noise or start with                   |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1516.24) | these things.                                                                                              |
| [25:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1517.24) | And it's kind of fun that Houdini can bring that foundational layer of like some random                    |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1521.4)  | noise and then you can build upon it.                                                                      |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1523.44) | The texture, bringing texture back to the web.                                                             |
| [25:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1525.76) | Yes, texture and it's drawn texture, right?                                                                |
| [25:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1527.72) | You don't have to whip out these big images.                                                               |
| [25:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1529.48) | And then I play a lot of video games and video games, the UI is they don't have tailwind,                  |
| [25:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1535.48) | you know, and they don't have a kit.                                                                       |
| [25:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1536.84) | All they have is a designer with an idea and they always make these really unique, excellent               |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1541.72) | things that I look at them, I go, the web can do that.                                                     |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1544.2)  | It's not easy.                                                                                             |
| [25:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1545.2)  | And then I start to reach for Houdini where Houdini can sort of upgrade a lot of these                     |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1548.6)  | web UIs into really cool techie, you know, neon glowing with all these funky cutout borders                |
| [25:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1554.56) | on them because well, you can do whatever you want once you've got that canvas.                            |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1557.98) | So I think about stuff like that.                                                                          |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1559.68) | Yeah, very cool.                                                                                           |
| [26:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1560.68) | I love how your inspiration is so different from mine.                                                     |
| [26:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1563.6)  | Yours is like video games and grunge and action sports and mine's like Ariana Grande and Mean              |
| [26:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1568.92) | Girls.                                                                                                     |
| [26:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1569.92) | Totally.                                                                                                   |
| [26:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1570.92) | So the current support for Houdini is all Chromium based browsers for specifically the                     |
| [26:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1576.6)  | paint worklet, not all of Houdini.                                                                         |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1579.2)  | You can use it in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Samsung, internet, and there is partial support in                  |
| [26:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1583.92) | Safari but not enough to actually use it in production there.                                              |
| [26:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1586.96) | It's also called deemed worth prototyping in Firefox.                                                      |
| [26:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1590.84) | If you go to ishoodinireadyyet.com, you can see all the status and also links to the specs                 |
| [26:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1598.16) | and how far along they are in the W3C working group process.                                               |
| [26:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1603.0)  | So those are your supports for this.                                                                       |
| [26:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1606.04) | Nice.                                                                                                      |
| [26:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1607.04) | Yeah, you can check from JavaScript, say if paint worklet is in CSS, you can do that and                   |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1611.16) | you can check with CSS at supports.                                                                        |
| [26:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1613.08) | So some of the examples that we'll be posting over the next few weeks will have at supports                |
| [26:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1616.56) | examples in there.                                                                                         |
| [26:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1617.56) | And then you mentioned to Jason Miller's polyfill, which has been really great for us.                     |
| [27:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1621.92) | Yeah, you've had a lot more experience with it.                                                            |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1623.52) | We want to talk some more about it a little bit.                                                           |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1625.04) | So it's been really great actually working on this project that we will not mention,                       |
| [27:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1630.04) | but you will soon see because we were able to really identify some holes in the polyfill                   |
| [27:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1633.8)  | and where we could fix that to be able to work with some worklets that we wanted to                        |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1638.48) | write.                                                                                                     |
| [27:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1639.48) | Also, it's important to note that if you do want to use the polyfill, don't do these                       |
| [27:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1642.92) | checks.                                                                                                    |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1643.92) | Like don't check for support because then you're not going to be serving it at all.                        |
| [27:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1646.44) | And you're not going to be seeing the polyfill.                                                            |
| [27:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1648.44) | So that's just like a little gotcha.                                                                       |
| [27:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1649.44) | You're not going to see those visual styles.                                                               |
| [27:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1650.44) | And you're going to make sure to include the polyfill script.                                              |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1654.0)  | So you could do this through a CDN if you're prototyping, or you can just locally manage                   |
| [27:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1658.34) | the file.                                                                                                  |
| [27:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1659.34) | It's called the CSS paint polyfill.                                                                        |
| [27:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1660.84) | Pretty straightforward.                                                                                    |
| [27:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1661.84) | Awesome.                                                                                                   |
| [27:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1662.84) | And yeah, it works as advertised.                                                                          |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1665.36) | I like it.                                                                                                 |

| [27:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1667.36) | So at the end of the day, we're recapping Houdini now.                                                     |
| [27:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1669.72) | Houdini Paint worklet is an optimized JavaScript function that paints onto a provided elements             |
| [27:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1674.8)  | canvas.                                                                                                    |
| [27:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1675.8)  | This worklet is where the actual work of painting is done potentially pixel by pixel, brick                |
| [28:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1680.12) | by brick, and within the size of the space it was provided.                                                |
| [28:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1683.92) | It's hopefully a standardized way to teach a browser's engine new tricks as if you dropped                 |

| [28:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1691.6)  | The worklet receives some developer authored CSS like colors, custom props, etc. that were                 |

| [28:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1701.2)  | The page finishes drawing and voila, the browser just did something it's never done before                 |
| [28:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1705.28) | because you taught it.                                                                                     |
| [28:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YlWP1lbFe2PSkHeByRvKK?&t=1706.64) | So anything canvas can draw, you can have Houdini draw on an element controlled from                       |
