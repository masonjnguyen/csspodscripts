| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.               |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=18.0)    | Today we're covering at font face and some pretty neat things that you can do with font               |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=22.12)   | metrics.                                                                                              |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=23.4)    | At font face is how you would load in a web font into your CSS file and specify all the               |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=28.32)   | tweaks you'd want the font to use.                                                                    |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=30.88)   | This is especially useful with new variable fonts as they expand the boundaries and axes              |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=36.36)   | of what's possible in web typography today.                                                           |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=38.96)   | Absolutely.                                                                                           |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=39.96)   | We've talked about fonts as sort of being these little apps that have all these different             |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=43.64)   | interfaces and different properties inside of there.                                                  |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=45.72)   | So we're going to talk about all that stuff.                                                          |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=47.8)    | And in episode 36, we dove into text and typography and covered like a few fonts, CSS properties      |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=52.48)   | like the font shorthand, font variant, font kerning, font feature settings, font variant              |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=56.96)   | alternates, font variant caps, font variant east, Asian font variant ligatures, font variant          |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=62.4)    | position and font size adjust.                                                                        |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=63.96)   | But today we're going over a lot of these property concepts, but from the perspective                 |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=68.58)   | of inside of at font face.                                                                            |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=70.92)   | So this is when you're making that at declaration where you would be initially setting the options    |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=75.8)    | up for the typeface.                                                                                  |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=76.8)    | So we're going to bring up these properties as they come into context with setting at                 |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=79.96)   | font space values and using them.                                                                     |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=81.84)   | And you know, why don't you kick us off with like, what is at font face?                              |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=84.88)   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=85.88)   | So at font face is a CSS at rule that specifies a custom font with which to display text on           |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=92.04)   | for your website.                                                                                     |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=93.4)    | So you can either load these from a server or use a local font.                                       |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=98.24)   | So you could have it local to your user system.                                                       |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=101.5)   | That's one thing that you could do, like when you're specifying maybe a common font.                  |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=105.68)  | But most of the time you're going to be loading it either from a server or you're serving             |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=109.68)  | it on your website yourself.                                                                          |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=110.8)   | So you've uploaded the font files and then you're going to grab those and use them.                   |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=115.12)  | So at font face, it's at font dash face.                                                              |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=119.28)  | This you'd write at font face and put the parentheses, the curly braces, then all the                 |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=123.8)   | things inside of those.                                                                               |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=125.48)  | This cannot be declared within a CSS selector.                                                        |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=128.3)   | You have to declare it outside of it.                                                                 |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=130.16)  | And it requires font family and source attributes.                                                    |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=133.16)  | So you'd write at font face and then the curlies and then font family.                                |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=136.52)  | You give it a name and then source.                                                                   |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=139.02)  | And then you'd have the source information and we're going to go into that.                           |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=141.72)  | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=142.72)  | Well, let's talk about font family first then.                                                        |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=144.52)  | So this is a, you know, font face is level with the root of the document.                             |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=149.6)   | Like it doesn't have to be first, but it's not going to be inside of any selectors.                   |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=153.12)  | And we've fetched a font and now we need to specify this font family name.                            |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=157.76)  | And this is sort of like the first thing that I tend to do is after I've typed in the source          |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=161.84)  | URL, I give it a name and you know, it is required.                                                   |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=164.24)  | But it's kind of fun that you can make this name whatever you want.                                   |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=168.0)   | So while it's required, it is an alias and it can be the word rad if you want to.                     |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=174.68)  | So you could import a font called Roboto and give it the name rad.                                    |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=178.44)  | And as long as you're referencing that font family name by rad throughout the rest of                 |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=182.24)  | your CSS, CSS knows that that alias is to that source font file.                                      |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=185.8)   | So it's just kind of a cool small tip of font family, but that's also as minimal and simple           |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=190.64)  | as the property is in app font face.                                                                  |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=192.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=193.64)  | So then we have source.                                                                               |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=194.84)  | The app font face source accepts a URL, local and format.                                             |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=199.08)  | So a URL would be a URL that points to a font file.                                                   |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=202.48)  | So that could be a URL to like Google font, you know, link, or it could be something local            |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=207.52)  | like URL slash fonts slash roboto.wav2.                                                               |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=212.28)  | That would be a local Roboto file, not a local.                                                       |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=215.2)   | That would be a server Roboto file that is served on your website.                                    |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=218.96)  | But then there is local, which actually looks for users local font.                                   |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=222.52)  | So you could do local and then inside of that parentheses for this local function Roboto,             |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=228.04)  | and it will search for the local file first.                                                          |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=230.76)  | So it's a little bit faster for your user if they already have it downloaded locally.                 |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=234.76)  | If you're using Arial or another very common typeface that's loaded on systems, this is               |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=240.8)   | super useful to throw in there as one of the URL options.                                             |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=245.52)  | So you can have multiple URLs, multiple files in here with this comma separated list.                 |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=252.16)  | So what you would do is you'd have source, you have either URL or local and then get                  |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=256.68)  | the name or the link to it.                                                                           |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=259.04)  | And then you'd have a space in the format type.                                                       |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=260.76)  | So you have to specify the format.                                                                    |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=262.04)  | So that'd be format of wav2, true type, open type, embedded open type or SDG.                         |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=267.96)  | Those are the options that you could do there.                                                        |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=269.44)  | So you could do like a URL to roboto.wav2 and then format wav2 and then comma a URL for               |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=276.72)  | roboto.wav or like a true type and then the format for that type.                                     |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=281.08)  | So you'd be specifying these links and types, the format, and you could have as many as               |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=286.96)  | you want in a comma separated list for the source.                                                    |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=289.0)   | Yeah, good call.                                                                                      |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=290.0)   | And as you were saying, you could put the local ones first and then put the URL ones.                 |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=295.2)   | So as the browser is looking at this list, it's going to check to find the first one                  |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=298.88)  | that's valid and it could find a local font and avoid an entire round trip to a server                |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=304.2)   | to grab a font because they already had roboto.                                                       |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=306.72)  | But if they don't, like here's a little fallback, super cool feature set in there.                    |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=312.08)  | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                        |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=313.08)  | The next one that you can put in app font face is font weight.                                        |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=316.6)   | And this accepts properties like normal, bold, extra bold, black, etc.                                |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=320.08)  | You can also do relative values like lighter and bolder, but you can also specify a range.            |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=324.72)  | So normal, bold and lighter and bolder, those are relative values that essentially equate             |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=329.52)  | to a number between 100 and 900, like variable fonts, you can do things in between.                   |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=334.48)  | And we talked about this in episode 36, but it's important in app font face because you               |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=338.92)  | can supply a range.                                                                                   |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=340.44)  | So normally if you say font weight, you can just pick one.                                            |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=343.64)  | But in the app font face property, you're essentially giving it a range to download.                  |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=349.76)  | And the browser won't grab any font faces in a family if they don't match the range.                  |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=354.62)  | So font weight is a good example here.                                                                |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=355.96)  | You'd be like, I only want 400 or 400 to 500.                                                         |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=360.84)  | And so then you point to Roboto, for example, and it would only download the 400 and 500              |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=365.48)  | font faces and skip the rest.                                                                         |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=368.54)  | So this is like these app font face properties that we're going through here, font weight             |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=372.44)  | being one of them, source being another one.                                                          |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=374.32)  | These are really, really robust opportunities to download less.                                       |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=378.64)  | Anyway, so that was just a small feature that many of these will get, but font weight is              |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=383.36)  | the first one to introduce into it.                                                                   |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=384.68)  | Yeah, you pass a range, you could say 100 to 900 and grab all of them.                                |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=388.52)  | Or you could pass a small range and only grab a piece of the font, which is kind of cool.             |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=392.8)   | Very good tip to know.                                                                                |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=395.08)  | So the next property on the list is called font display.                                              |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=398.32)  | And this specifies how a font is displayed based on whether and when it's downloaded                  |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=404.42)  | and ready to use.                                                                                     |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=405.88)  | So to understand font display, let's first go over the display timeline for fonts for                 |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=412.32)  | how fonts are loaded on a page.                                                                       |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=414.42)  | So there's three different periods.                                                                   |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=415.88)  | There's the font block period, font swap period, and font failure period.                             |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=420.48)  | So first is the font block period.                                                                    |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=423.64)  | Here if the font is loaded, show it.                                                                  |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=426.08)  | If it's not loaded in this font block period, show an invisible fallback.                             |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=430.32)  | So you wouldn't see any text at this time.                                                            |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=432.18)  | This is kind of what you would think of when you think of a flash of invisible text, fout.            |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=437.7)   | It's the font block period.                                                                           |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=439.24)  | So then there is the font swap period.                                                                |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=442.16)  | So here if the font is loaded, show it, and if it's not loaded in this period, show something.        |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=448.0)   | Render a fallback font face.                                                                          |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=449.7)   | So this is where you might see something like a flash of unstyled type.                               |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=453.28)  | So that's fout is.                                                                                    |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=455.16)  | That's like foit, which is flash of invisible text versus fout.                                       |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=458.44)  | That's the swap period, the unstyled type.                                                            |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=460.72)  | And then finally you have a font failure period.                                                      |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=463.88)  | So here if the font still isn't loaded, the user agent treats it as a failed load and                 |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=468.8)   | sends a normal fallback.                                                                              |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=471.0)   | So you just get something.                                                                            |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=473.6)   | If it went through block period, swap period, and then finally got failure period, just               |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=477.24)  | send something.                                                                                       |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=478.8)   | So the values for the font display property are auto, which the user agent defines.                   |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=485.16)  | There's block.                                                                                        |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=486.16)  | So you have some block time and then you have an infinite swap period.                                |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=489.52)  | So whenever the font loads, you'll swap it.                                                           |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=492.24)  | Then there's swap, which is a very short block period, and then infinite swap period.                 |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=496.92)  | So you're not going to see as much invisible text with swap.                                          |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=501.34)  | Then there's fallback, which gives you a very short block period and a short swap period.             |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=507.5)   | So if you are, you're not going to see a lot of invisible text, you're also probably not              |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=513.08)  | going to get that swap in.                                                                            |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=514.26)  | If it doesn't happen fast enough, you might see a fallback font.                                      |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=516.76)  | This is the most likely option to see a fallback.                                                     |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=521.32)  | And then there's the optional value, which is a very short block period and no swapping.              |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=526.5)   | So you have a short block period, you'll see a little flash of invisible text, and then               |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=532.84)  | you won't swap.                                                                                       |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=533.96)  | If that font loads, then you'll just see whatever is loaded in first.                                 |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=537.62)  | So Google Fonts added a swap value by default now to the download URL because this tends              |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=544.0)   | to be a better user experience.                                                                       |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=545.9)   | You have some text on the page, the user can see information immediately, and then you're             |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=550.32)  | going to swap to your typeface that is your aesthetic.                                                |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=554.54)  | So you're not blocking any content, and that's what swap excels at compared to the other              |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=560.36)  | options.                                                                                              |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=561.36)  | So yeah, lots of options.                                                                             |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=563.46)  | If you are using swap, there's a bunch of tools that you can use to make sure that the                |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=565.78)  | default typeface that uses a system font looks similar to your font, or at least a little             |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=571.02)  | bit more similar by adjusting the kerning and things like that.                                       |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=574.42)  | But we can go deep into typography and optimizing performance for it.                                 |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=579.98)  | Absolutely.                                                                                           |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=580.98)  | What's the next value, Adam?                                                                          |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=581.98)  | Yeah, well, yeah, there's like commutative CLS, right?                                                |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=584.94)  | You can have layout shift from loading a font because the font that you supplied as like              |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=589.62)  | the OK Sans Serif could be slightly taller than the font you loaded.                                  |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=594.26)  | And now you load a font and it swaps and has to shift all the layout.                                 |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=597.78)  | So there's like folks that are like hyper focused on how do you find a fallback font                  |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=601.82)  | that's like generally installed, that's the same size of the one that you're installing.              |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=605.06)  | So when the swap happens, it's not this like janky transformer moment.                                |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=608.9)   | Yeah, you covered that really well.                                                                   |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=611.0)   | That's a complex topic and I learned stuff listening to you.                                          |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=615.54)  | So thank you for that.                                                                                |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=616.54)  | All right, let's talk about font stretch.                                                             |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=619.3)   | So this selects a font face from the family with a matching value.                                    |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=622.06)  | Otherwise it'll find the closest match in the family.                                                 |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=624.14)  | So it accepts like percentages that are less than 100, condense some text and sort of squeeze         |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=629.28)  | it and values above 100% expand the text.                                                             |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=633.82)  | So make it sort of like stretched out in its width.                                                   |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=636.62)  | It can't go less than zero, which I suppose makes sense, but it can go above 100.                     |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=641.18)  | So you could expand to 200, but you could not condense to negative 100 or anything under              |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=647.74)  | zero.                                                                                                 |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=648.74)  | It can't condense to a negative value.                                                                |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=650.02)  | Anyway, it has some keywords, which are what you're probably more familiar with, and that's           |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=654.78)  | ultra condensed is 50%.                                                                               |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=657.62)  | So right if it's under 100%, it's going to be condensing to be smaller.                               |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=660.74)  | We have extra condensed, condensed, semi condensed and normal and normal being 100% and all those     |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=666.34)  | other condensed values were in between 50% and 100.                                                   |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=669.26)  | And then we go from 100 to 200 with these values, which is semi expanded, expanded,                   |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=675.86)  | ultra or extra expanded.                                                                              |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=677.26)  | Did I just make one up?                                                                               |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=678.38)  | Oh no, ultra expanded is next.                                                                        |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=679.9)   | Okay, that's actually awesome.                                                                        |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=680.9)   | We have-                                                                                              |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=681.9)   | Now they're there, yeah.                                                                              |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=682.9)   | We have normal, semi expanded, expanded, extra expanded, ultra expanded.                              |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=687.46)  | That has to be said in like a turbo robot voice, right?                                               |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=689.94)  | It's awesome.                                                                                         |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=691.98)  | And variable fonts can support an even wider range of stretching.                                     |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=695.3)   | And we're sort of even doing it a little injustice saying that the WDTH variations, it's like         |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=701.86)  | the width kind of shorthand in a lot of these variable fonts allow you to sort of change              |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=708.42)  | the width there, which is very similar to being condensed or expanded.                                |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=712.62)  | But you can animate them in a variable font and in a variable font, they have even more               |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=717.4)   | specific things like the stems on a letter could be wider or less.                                    |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=721.98)  | And so the circles would still be sort of thin, but the stems become wide and there's                 |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=725.62)  | so many different options inside of variable fonts for kind of tweaking widths and stretching         |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=729.82)  | effects.                                                                                              |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=730.82)  | But anyway, when you use this font stretch as part of the font face declaration, a range              |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=735.5)   | again can be supplied so that you can limit the font face downloads.                                  |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=738.78)  | So if the font face doesn't have ultra condensed or ultra expanded, then you can specify a            |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=743.98)  | range that makes it not even go look for those, or you could specify a range that specifically        |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=748.94)  | grab.                                                                                                 |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=749.94)  | So the same opportunities before here in font stretch.                                                |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=753.14)  | Yeah, lots of really cool things you could do, especially with variable fonts.                        |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=757.22)  | The next value is font style.                                                                         |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=759.34)  | And this one is limited just compared to some of the other things we're talking about.                |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=762.94)  | But font style is a pretty commonly used property because this is how you make things italic.         |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=768.84)  | So the values for font style are either normal, italic or oblique.                                    |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=772.9)   | And italic and oblique are slightly different.                                                        |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=775.86)  | They're very different if you're a typographer, but if you're just like a layperson looking           |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=778.9)   | at text, you're like, oh, they look, what's the difference?                                           |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=781.9)   | Okay, so italic is usually a typeface value.                                                          |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=785.66)  | So you have maybe very specific curvature.                                                            |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=788.58)  | You might have more nuance in the typeface that is an italic typeface.                                |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=793.14)  | It's actually designed to be italic.                                                                  |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=795.18)  | Whereas oblique is a slant that could be a typeface provided, but it's usually just taking            |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=801.82)  | the normal text and slanting it on the computer.                                                      |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=804.58)  | So with oblique, I mean, if there is an oblique typeface provided, then you'll get that.              |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=808.8)   | But most of the time you set a font style to oblique and then you set a degree value.                 |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=814.5)   | So you could have a default value or you could set degree like 30 degrees, like font style            |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=819.3)   | oblique 30 degrees.                                                                                   |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=820.3)   | And you can also have two different values to allow for a range of angles.                            |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=824.8)   | So you'll have the best angle in that range.                                                          |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=827.46)  | So you could do font style oblique 30 deg, 50 deg, and then it'll pick the best oblique               |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=833.38)  | value between that range.                                                                             |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=835.94)  | So italic is probably one that you use a lot, oblique maybe not so much, but font style               |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=841.02)  | is another thing that you can do when you set your font face.                                         |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=844.98)  | Awesome.                                                                                              |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=845.98)  | Let's talk about font variant next, which is shorthand for a list of more specific properties.        |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=851.78)  | Those other properties are font variant alternates, font variant caps, font variant East Asian,       |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=857.5)   | font variant ligatures, and font variant numeric.                                                     |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=860.86)  | And you can kind of pass these values like small caps, slash zeros.                                   |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=865.14)  | We kind of covered these again in that previous episode, and tabular numbers.                         |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=868.82)  | But when you use it inside of at font face, you would say something like this, like font              |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=872.58)  | dash variant colon old style nums, proportional nums, and swash parentheses rad and parentheses.      |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=880.46)  | And so what I've done there is in the font face, I've specified how once it loads the                 |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=887.78)  | font, I want you to go make these modifications to the display types because there's different        |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=891.82)  | numbers that came with that font and there's different slashes.                                       |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=894.7)   | And there might even be a couple of swashes on some cool letters like a Q.                            |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=898.02)  | And so I'm being very explicit about on load, make sure these are the default entirely.               |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=904.54)  | There's also this option where you can kind of tweak all the font variants at a global                |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=908.98)  | level called at font feature values.                                                                  |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=911.6)   | So this is not something that goes inside of at font face, but this is often used alongside           |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=916.26)  | of it.                                                                                                |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=917.26)  | It is only available in Firefox and Safari right now, but this lets you bundle variant                |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=920.88)  | options for a font easier and use them for reference later.                                           |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=924.54)  | So let's say you have just some numbers being displayed somewhere and you want the tabular            |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=928.7)   | numbers and these couple of modifications that you get these nice numbers.                            |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=932.58)  | And then over here you have another scenario where you have like a header and it's got                |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=935.6)   | swashes and cool ligatures.                                                                           |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=938.02)  | You could stash both of those styles in this font feature value grouping and then apply               |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=943.1)   | it somewhere.                                                                                         |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=944.18)  | So kind of a cool little concept there and maybe even worth a mini episode because it                 |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=948.66)  | has some gems inside of it.                                                                           |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=951.1)   | So at font features has things like at style set and at stylistic and at ornaments.                   |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=955.8)   | These are all things that you can sort of target inside the font.                                     |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=958.42)  | Oh yeah, I love ornaments.                                                                            |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=959.98)  | It's so cool.                                                                                         |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=960.98)  | I'm like style set and stylistic.                                                                     |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=962.7)   | I'm like I need to go learn these more.                                                               |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=964.18)  | This is good stuff.                                                                                   |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=965.18)  | So anyway, that was font variant which is shorthand for a bunch of other cool features                |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=969.1)   | in your font and it's a way for you on load to specify how these should default.                      |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=974.02)  | It's kind of cool.                                                                                    |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=975.3)   | I think that ornaments and swash is probably my favorite because I'm very into like a hand            |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=981.26)  | lettering and ligatures and cool things like that.                                                    |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=984.7)   | And yeah, swash is sort of like the extended cues or extended characters that look very               |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=990.66)  | nice in traditional typography.                                                                       |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=993.42)  | So there's also font feature settings which controls advanced typographic features in                 |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=998.46)  | OpenType fonts.                                                                                       |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=999.66)  | So font feature settings is a low level feature designed to handle special cases where no             |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1004.38) | other way exists to enable or access an OpenType font feature.                                        |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1008.38) | And the reason why is because OpenType font could have any feature values.                            |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1013.38) | It could specify something unique to that font and then you need to be able to access                 |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1017.82) | it in a way.                                                                                          |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1019.34) | The suggestion is that you always use the font variant when you can.                                  |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1023.58) | So everything that Adam just went over where you would specify, you know, font variant                |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1027.74) | caps, font variant ligatures, those are more common than having something like the font               |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1032.26) | feature settings, but where you can't use that, you can use font feature settings.                    |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1038.46) | So yeah, font variant, it's just more clear.                                                          |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1041.3)  | You're using English instead of these tags, but then with font feature settings, you would            |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1045.06) | have these like string based tags like liga for ligatures or SMCP for small caps.                     |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1053.88) | And there's a bunch of these.                                                                         |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1055.22) | So there's frac, which is for fractions, zero for slash zeros, lnum for lining figures.               |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1062.78) | There's onum for old style figures, dlig for discretionary ligatures.                                 |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1067.74) | So there's a lot here.                                                                                |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1069.26) | Like you could do kerning with this.                                                                  |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1070.82) | You could do hist, which is for historical forms.                                                     |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1073.94) | There's swsh, which stands for swashes.                                                               |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1078.36) | There's medial forms, which is mmedi.                                                                 |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1080.82) | There's localized forms, locl.                                                                        |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1084.38) | There's so many, there's isolated forms, final forms, mark.                                           |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1087.46) | There's mkmk, which is mark to mark positioning.                                                      |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1090.76) | So when you're using a typeface, it should have documentation about what you can do with              |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1096.62) | it.                                                                                                   |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1097.62) | And there's a ton of really cool variable font websites that show you all of these different          |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1102.02) | axes.                                                                                                 |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1103.02) | These are like considered axes of style for the typeface and they're really cool.                     |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1108.78) | So yeah, if you're using these, what it looks like is font feature settings, colon, and               |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1113.26) | then you would put the tag name.                                                                      |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1114.62) | So like in quotations, smcp, and you would do a space and like a one or the keyword on                |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1121.58) | to turn it on.                                                                                        |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1122.92) | So you could do a space separated, sorry, a comma separated list of these values.                     |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1127.14) | So you could do like smcp one and then comma and then in quotes like liga space one, and              |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1134.42) | then you'd have both of those values turned on.                                                       |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1136.68) | So just more stuff that you could do with variable typography and open type fonts and                 |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1142.12) | just there's so much.                                                                                 |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1144.46) | There's so much.                                                                                      |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1145.46) | We'll put some links in the show notes of websites that show the power of these and                   |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1148.62) | highlight like all the things that you can do.                                                        |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1151.52) | They're really fun.                                                                                   |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1152.52) | There's some cool typefaces in there.                                                                 |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1154.2)  | Super cool.                                                                                           |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1155.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1156.2)  | It's almost like this is your custom zone where the other properties are named and known              |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1159.32) | ahead of time by CSS and they're common across fonts.                                                 |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1162.3)  | And this is like, no, I've loaded a font with some really interesting stuff.                          |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1166.62) | So I'm going to access it through this little string interface and you go past flags and              |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1170.42) | it's almost like a command line little interface into your font feature settings.                     |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1174.02) | That is really cool.                                                                                  |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1175.82) | All right.                                                                                            |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1176.82) | Well, that goes nicely with font variation settings, which is next.                                   |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1181.58) | And this allows authors to specify again, more low level open type or true type font                  |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1185.7)  | variations in the font face rule.                                                                     |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1187.66) | So you could set values for something like the height of a font.                                      |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1192.9)  | So you could say like hxgt 0.5 and that would set the font's optical sizing or you could              |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1198.98) | set the optical sizing with opsz, but sorry, x height with x, see this is hxgt.                       |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1206.84) | That's x height.                                                                                      |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1208.76) | Or you could set opsz as the optional sizing or the optical sizing.                                   |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1213.18) | These are essentially low level access into really tight customizations.                              |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1217.58) | Like right, how can you can set the x height of a value in the font through these font                |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1222.58) | variation settings.                                                                                   |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1223.58) | It's really cool.                                                                                     |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1225.26) | You can also, so when you use it in an app font face rule, you'd say font-variation-settings          |
| [20:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1229.7)  | colon quote wght for weight end quote and then 450.                                                   |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1235.38) | And notice I didn't pass 400 or 500.                                                                  |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1237.76) | This is a variable font and I know that it can go in between.                                         |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1240.56) | And so I've specified that when this loads, the font variation settings and the weight                |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1243.58) | of this should be at 450.                                                                             |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1246.26) | And that's just really cool.                                                                          |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1247.26) | So on load, you can set these really pinpointed defaults to modify the font and customize             |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1252.74) | it for your use cases.                                                                                |
| [20:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1254.1)  | So cool.                                                                                              |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1255.1)  | Yeah, another really cool unique optimization that variable fonts give us.                            |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1259.66) | So finally for app font face, the last property that you can set is a unicode range.                  |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1264.78) | So this allows us to set a range of unicode options to be used from the font.                         |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1269.02) | And by default, it's everything the font provides, but you can use this as a performance optimization |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1274.26) | by only picking out specific characters.                                                              |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1277.5)  | So one example would be if I just wanted to use the ampersand from a specific font, I                 |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1281.9)  | would set unicode range to U, capital U, and then plus, and then 26.                                  |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1288.1)  | I think that's the one for the ampersand.                                                             |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1290.38) | It's usually U plus and then a certain value.                                                         |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1293.06) | You can also do a range like U plus like 0-7F and that would be a range of font feature               |
| [21:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1300.38) | characters.                                                                                           |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1301.38) | But one little trick that you can do with this is if you want to use an ampersand from                |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1304.42) | one typeface, but use the rest of a set from another typeface, you could set a unicode                |
| [21:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1308.82) | range for that specific ampersand typeface and then make that like the first typeface                 |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1314.62) | in your set so that it would use that ampersand, but then use the rest of the characters for          |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1318.36) | something else.                                                                                       |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1319.54) | So I've used this before because I didn't like the ampersand that I used with the typeface            |
| [22:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1324.22) | I used on my blog website.                                                                            |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1325.94) | So I swapped that out.                                                                                |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1328.26) | But yeah, I liked another font on its own.                                                            |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1331.1)  | So yeah, this is great for if you don't have a lot of text on your page, too.                         |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1335.54) | Like maybe you're using this for like a unique header and then you have to download the entire        |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1339.1)  | font.                                                                                                 |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1340.1)  | So you could do a couple of performance optimizations here and there with unicode range.              |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1343.94) | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1344.94) | So you could swap an and ampersand on page load.                                                      |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1350.42) | So a page load, it has like a default ampersand.                                                      |
