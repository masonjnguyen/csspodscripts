| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z-Index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=17.08)   | Today's episode is all about color.                                                                  |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=19.32)   | And color is so rad.                                                                                 |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=21.04)   | It's practical, it's emotional, it's a tool.                                                         |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=24.08)   | And needless to say, we are big color fans here.                                                     |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=27.18)   | It's notably very easy to get started with color and super difficult to master.                      |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=31.72)   | Does that sound familiar like anything else?                                                         |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=33.58)   | Like CSS, perhaps?                                                                                   |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=35.6)    | Like CSS.                                                                                            |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=36.6)    | Right?                                                                                               |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=37.6)    | In today's episode, we talk all about colors, various syntaxes, how to define it, how it's           |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=41.56)   | translated and how it's put onto the screen for your users.                                          |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=44.56)   | So many things.                                                                                      |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=45.56)   | This is actually going to be a longer episode.                                                       |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=47.78)   | So stay tuned.                                                                                       |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=48.78)   | There's a lot of juicy bits in here.                                                                 |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=50.3)    | And also note that this is a two part episode.                                                       |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=52.9)    | So this episode is going to be all about using color.                                                |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=55.16)   | And in our next episode, we'll go over how the perception of that applied color might                |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=59.08)   | vary from user to user and screen to screen.                                                         |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=61.8)    | So we'll talk about what you can do in that case to make sure your brand shines through.             |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=65.48)   | And also we'll talk about some device independent color modes.                                       |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=68.88)   | But first, let's talk about color in a high level way as a CSS type.                                 |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=73.28)   | Yes, CSS has types.                                                                                  |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=74.88)   | Yes, it does.                                                                                        |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=75.88)   | You can even see it in the spec.                                                                     |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=76.88)   | They're surrounded with angle brackets, just like you see in TypeScript and other places.            |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=80.56)   | And color is a data type.                                                                            |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=82.16)   | It's mentioned all the time as just a thing that can be accepted along with other types              |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=86.14)   | like percentage and angle and number.                                                                |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=88.24)   | And it's fun to note these because in order to create a valid color, you have to pass                |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=91.54)   | a data structure to it that it can understand, which is pretty typical CSS requirement.              |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=96.64)   | You know, it'll throw away whatever it doesn't understand.                                           |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=98.72)   | But it can be valuable to research these types in case you're a type nerd or just an interface       |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=102.64)  | nerd like how things interface.                                                                      |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=104.16)  | There's little things to learn in there.                                                             |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=105.44)  | Like we'll find one later where angle sounds like an innocent data type.                             |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=109.0)   | But we'll figure out that it's actually jam packed with opportunity and options.                     |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=112.68)  | So it's really fun.                                                                                  |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=113.68)  | Anyway, I think we're ready to jump into color syntax.                                               |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=116.2)   | You know, we want to take us away.                                                                   |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=117.36)  | Yeah, you've probably seen a few different formats for syntax.                                       |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=120.2)   | You might already have a color format or syntax that is your favorite.                               |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=123.76)  | You may have preferences.                                                                            |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=125.2)   | We can define colors either through keywords or numbers within a coordinate system.                  |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=129.76)  | Keywords are some of my favorite ways of expressing color because they're easy to understand         |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=133.44)  | and prototype with.                                                                                  |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=135.0)   | There are 148 named CSS colors, everything from basic colors like black and white to                 |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=140.56)  | papaya whip and tomato, which look great together, by the way.                                       |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=143.92)  | And at the end of 2019, Adam and I looked into color usage on the web for the CSS chapter            |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=149.12)  | of the web Almanac.                                                                                  |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=150.88)  | Fun fact, most web pages have over 100 colors on them according to the HTTP archive data             |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=156.2)   | that we looked at.                                                                                   |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=157.2)   | We'll have a link for that in the show notes below.                                                  |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=159.36)  | But it was really interesting to see color trends on the web.                                        |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=162.0)   | Adam, do you want to help me out here while we list the most popularly used color names              |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=166.2)   | in order of popularity?                                                                              |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=168.12)  | You know it.                                                                                         |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=169.12)  | All right, I'll get started.                                                                         |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=170.12)  | So the most popularly used color is white.                                                           |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=172.82)  | No surprise there.                                                                                   |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=173.82)  | Shocking.                                                                                            |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=174.82)  | And number two is black.                                                                             |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=176.16)  | Wow, who could have known?                                                                           |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=177.78)  | And then we have red, which is great because I prototype with red all the time.                      |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=180.44)  | Ah, see and I prototype with blue a lot, which is next.                                              |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=183.12)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=184.12)  | So after that comes gray.                                                                            |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=185.12)  | And then silver.                                                                                     |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=186.12)  | And then green.                                                                                      |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=187.24)  | And then gray again, but this time spelled with an E instead of an A.                                |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=189.8)   | So I actually think this is really funny, the gray versus gray situation, because gray               |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=194.92)  | with an E was added later to the color spec.                                                         |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=198.28)  | And the usage of gray with an E is about half that of gray with an A. And this also is the           |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=203.56)  | same for like dim gray, slate gray, all the different gray types.                                    |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=206.84)  | But I'm glad that we have gray A-E parody now on the web and you can write it however                |

| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=228.84)  | Okay.                                                                                                |

| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=232.06)  | You'll find them all over VisBug.                                                                    |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=234.04)  | But then, you know, my third one, I mentioned it earlier.                                            |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=236.12)  | It's blue.                                                                                           |

| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=240.12)  | I use hot pink a lot.                                                                                |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=241.12)  | I actually use hot pink all over my personal blog.                                                   |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=243.2)   | I use tomato a lot.                                                                                  |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=244.88)  | I think I use wheat all the time, the W-E-H-E-T.                                                     |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=250.44)  | Light gray, dim gray, I think is so funny because the way the shades of gray work and                |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=253.88)  | CSS named colors are just so funky.                                                                  |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=256.16)  | But yeah, I use CSS colors a lot, especially when I'm prototyping.                                   |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=259.76)  | And then when I work with a designer, they sort of pick the color syntax profile and                 |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=264.84)  | coordinate system that we use.                                                                       |

| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=275.0)   | And I just kind of started using shades of pink for prototyping.                                     |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=277.12)  | Well, yeah, deep pink I recently learned about.                                                      |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=279.24)  | It might be superior.                                                                                |

| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=281.42)  | It's more of a hot pink than hot pink is.                                                            |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=283.48)  | Yeah, I agree, which I kind of like the striking nature of hot pink.                                 |

| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=293.32)  | They made it the syntax selection, like the color when you selected text, it would be                |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=297.04)  | the highlight and the background.                                                                    |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=298.28)  | Anyway, you'd go to websites and you knew that they used HTML5 boilerplate when you                  |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=301.28)  | highlighted text and it was hot pink.                                                                |

| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=313.96)  | fun.                                                                                                 |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=314.96)  | There's transparent and current color.                                                               |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=318.0)   | Transparent kind of self-explanatory.                                                                |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=319.72)  | It's a keyword that you can use in space of a color that will represent the lack of color.           |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=324.48)  | Now I want to make a little aside and beware note here, which is there's a difference between        |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=329.04)  | transparent black and transparent white.                                                             |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=331.52)  | So like if you're making a gradient that needs to go from this color to a transparent color,         |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=336.2)   | it can behoove you to make sure that that transparent color that you're writing has                  |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=341.02)  | some hue in it.                                                                                      |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=342.88)  | You might run into a bug where you get this kind of muddy looking transparency and it                |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=347.2)   | might be because the keyword transparent is black focused and not white focused or there's           |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=353.14)  | also browser inconsistencies.                                                                        |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=354.9)   | So anyway, the transparent keyword, very cool, but might have some edge cases that are funny.        |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=359.0)   | Yeah, definitely test browsers and use transparent because I run into this several times where       |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=363.64)  | I think that my gradient will look a certain way, but then in other browsers there'll be             |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=367.8)   | some weirdness and it's because they're using a different base value to make that transparent        |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=373.36)  | like pull from.                                                                                      |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=374.36)  | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=375.36)  | And this is where kind of the cool new syntax is coming handy too, where it's nice and easy          |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=378.36)  | to put alpha or transparency on the end of a color, but we'll get there.                             |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=381.92)  | Okay, let's talk about current color and current color is a keyword that you can use that represents |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=386.04)  | the contextual computed value of the color property.                                                 |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=390.04)  | So if you use current color as a border, you will get a border color that matches the same           |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=395.32)  | as the text color for that particular element.                                                       |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=398.08)  | This can be really handy.                                                                            |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=399.08)  | Like if you want to make a button where the borders and other highlights of it match the             |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=402.32)  | text color of the button, current color can be this really cool contextual dynamic keyword           |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=406.84)  | that you can use.                                                                                    |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=408.04)  | So I have a pop quiz quick question for you, Yuna.                                                   |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=411.44)  | If current color is the computed color for a subject element, what if that subject specifies         |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=416.68)  | its text color as current color?                                                                     |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=419.16)  | So let's say I have div, I open up my curly brackets and I say color colon current color             |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=424.22)  | semi-colon and I finish it off.                                                                      |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=425.76)  | What color is it?                                                                                    |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=427.4)   | Well color cascades, so it should take its parents color in that case, right?                        |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=431.08)  | The computed color of its parent.                                                                    |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=433.16)  | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=434.16)  | It inherits, I mean to say.                                                                          |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=435.16)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=436.16)  | It is treated as though it is inherit.                                                               |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=437.72)  | So very nice.                                                                                        |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=439.74)  | Color nerds.                                                                                         |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=440.74)  | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=441.74)  | So we just did some of the keywords that represent these common colors, but let's talk about         |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=446.12)  | system keywords and these are colors that are coming down from your platform.                        |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=450.72)  | So if you want to match the system inside of your web application, you have these system             |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=455.16)  | keywords that you can use.                                                                           |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=456.54)  | Now they were created back in color level three.                                                     |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=459.0)   | They were deprecated, but now they are back from the dead.                                           |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=463.64)  | Oh, zombie emoji rising from the dead all colored in color and color level four.                     |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=469.3)   | So in color level four system colors are back and without like going into too much detail            |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=473.68)  | on these, you know, I want to rapid fire on.                                                         |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=475.88)  | Can we just rapid fire some of these for the folks on the show?                                      |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=478.2)   | What do you think?                                                                                   |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=479.2)   | Yeah, for sure.                                                                                      |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=480.2)   | So there's active border, active caption, Apple workspace, background, button, highlight,            |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=485.52)  | button shadow.                                                                                       |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=486.52)  | There's a caption text, inactive border and an inactive caption, info text.                          |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=491.12)  | There's menu, menu text, scroll bar, window, window frame, window text.                              |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=496.8)   | If you're wondering what those are, check out the link in the show notes to the spec                 |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=499.68)  | that explains in more detail.                                                                        |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=501.2)   | But essentially this is color that the system that you are using will define in your application.    |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=506.92)  | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=507.92)  | Can be really cool to kind of look very integrated.                                                  |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=509.72)  | And then there's one that got deprecated in CSS level three or in color level three and              |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=514.36)  | never made it into color level four.                                                                 |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=516.04)  | And it's the system keyword called flavor.                                                           |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=518.32)  | I love that.                                                                                         |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=519.32)  | Me too.                                                                                              |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=520.32)  | I would have loved it to be like the current color.                                                  |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=522.04)  | What does it mean?                                                                                   |

| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=524.04)  | So it looks like there's a successor.                                                                |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=525.04)  | I don't know if we covered it in our list there.                                                     |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=526.56)  | Oh, we didn't.                                                                                       |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=527.56)  | That's annoying.                                                                                     |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=528.56)  | But it's the word highlight.                                                                         |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=529.56)  | So these system keywords, they're also all capitalized.                                              |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=531.92)  | So you'll find the initial letters capitalized.                                                      |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=533.6)   | It's how they can be differentiated from other keywords.                                             |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=536.02)  | And highlight is the successor.                                                                      |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=537.54)  | So now we can use instead of flavor, we can say highlight and that'd be the platform color           |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=542.0)   | that's set in your operating systems like in Windows 10 or Mac OS.                                   |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=545.68)  | You can go say, hey, instead of having everything be blue, I'd like everything to be hot pink.       |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=549.48)  | And that follows you all the way into your webpage.                                                  |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=552.28)  | Kind of neat.                                                                                        |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=553.28)  | I like that.                                                                                         |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=554.28)  | And that makes a lot more sense in terms of design systems because people aren't calling             |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=556.04)  | their highlight colors flavor colors anymore, I guess.                                               |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=558.92)  | Maybe they did once, but I missed it.                                                                |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=562.84)  | Numerical colors are also super popular and they're likely the first way that you've interacted      |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=566.52)  | with web colors.                                                                                     |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=567.84)  | Hexadecimal notation for colors or hex for short is essentially a shorthand for RGB.                 |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=573.24)  | And according to the Web Almanac, all that data that we looked through, hex is the most              |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=577.32)  | popular color syntax type pretty much by far.                                                        |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=580.66)  | If we think about the color black as being RGB 000, that's zero on the red, zero on the              |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=586.72)  | green and zero on the blue channels, this aligns to the hex value of hash 000.                       |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=592.48)  | So it's sort of easy to remember how those come together when you think of zero being                |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=596.8)   | black for both hex and RGB.                                                                          |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=599.04)  | White, which is RGB 255, 255, 255, that's the max on the channel scale for the red,                  |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=605.4)   | green and blue channel, corresponds to the hex value of hash FFF.                                    |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=609.88)  | So if this looks confusing, while RGB is on a scale of zero to 255, hex is on a scale                |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=615.24)  | from zero to nine and then A to F, zero being the darkest and F being the lightest.                  |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=620.96)  | You can write hex colors with three digits, but this is actually a shortcut for a six                |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=625.36)  | digit extended hex code.                                                                             |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=627.3)   | When you write with three digits, the numbers repeat within the group.                               |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=630.28)  | So for example, if you had a hex code that was hash A4E, that would be equivalent to                 |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=635.32)  | hash AA44EE.                                                                                         |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=638.56)  | When writing hex by hand, you likely don't need to exceed three digits for your hex codes            |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=643.2)   | for basic color expression, but to represent a wider range of color and to get more specific,        |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=647.84)  | you can write the full format of six characters.                                                     |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=650.28)  | In color level four, you can also write hex codes with an alpha value at the end.                    |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=654.18)  | This means you can write four digit and eight digit hex codes, the four digit ones being             |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=658.4)   | a shorthand for the eight.                                                                           |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=660.28)  | If you wanted to write a color, say black, with a 53% alpha transparency, that can be                |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=665.4)   | represented as hash 0008, or extended, that would be 00000088.                                       |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=672.64)  | I had to count that one out with my fingers.                                                         |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=675.56)  | It's important to note how the hex code scale correlates to alpha values of zero to 100%.            |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=681.76)  | 0% alpha, which would be fully transparent, would be written as 00, and 100%, which means            |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=688.08)  | no transparency and full opaqueness, would be FF.                                                    |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=691.48)  | Remember, the hex scale is F to A and zero to nine.                                                  |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=695.24)  | A 50% alpha is represented as the hex string 80.                                                     |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=698.76)  | 20% will be represented as 33, and 75% is BF.                                                        |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=703.2)   | So you have to be diligent when you're writing alpha values with hex by hand.                        |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=707.52)  | Killer breakdown of hex.                                                                             |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=709.2)   | I really appreciated that.                                                                           |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=710.48)  | It was just eloquent.                                                                                |

| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=712.48)  | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                    |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=713.48)  | I'd stop complimenting Yuna and move on to what the next section is.                                 |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=716.68)  | The next section is, I just wanted to make a brief aside here, that there's syntax updates           |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=721.08)  | in color level four of the CSS spec.                                                                 |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=723.08)  | And a lot of these syntax updates are available today, some of them not, but it's really nice        |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=726.88)  | to know that they're coming down and you can start to use them.                                      |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=729.56)  | And so here's some of the things to note in color level four that have to do with syntax             |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=733.58)  | updates.                                                                                             |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=734.58)  | You no longer need to write RGBA or HSLA.                                                            |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=738.28)  | The A at the end can be thrown off, and instead you can put a slash after the third channel          |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=743.58)  | and pass a percentage.                                                                               |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=745.12)  | So if you were writing RGBA, you know, 0, 0, 0, comma, 90% or something to have like                 |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=750.62)  | a 90% black, you could just say RGB, 0, 0, 0, slash 80% or 0.8 and pass your percentage              |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=757.8)   | in that way.                                                                                         |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=758.8)   | So anyway, you can get rid of the delineation between RGBA and RGB.                                  |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=763.4)   | You can just use RGB or just HSL.                                                                    |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=766.52)  | Kind of nice to know.                                                                                |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=767.52)  | There's also been a war on commas in the CSS working group.                                          |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=770.24)  | I like commas personally.                                                                            |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=771.64)  | Really?                                                                                              |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=772.64)  | I'm all about like dropping syntax, but I get it.                                                    |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=775.48)  | Commas are kind of special, I think, in CSS.                                                         |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=777.16)  | So they're trying to put them back to their origins.                                                 |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=779.32)  | I don't know.                                                                                        |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=780.32)  | We'll show you.                                                                                      |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=781.32)  | Could do one commas.                                                                                 |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=782.32)  | Probably.                                                                                            |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=783.32)  | But anyway, you don't have to use commas anymore.                                                    |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=784.32)  | So you can write RGB without commas in between them and just use space.                              |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=787.6)   | Kind of interesting.                                                                                 |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=788.6)   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=789.6)   | And let's see.                                                                                       |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=790.6)   | Get ready for more color level four stuff in the next episode.                                       |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=793.86)  | Next episode.                                                                                        |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=794.86)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=795.86)  | All about perceiving color.                                                                          |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=796.86)  | So anyway, you know, can you tell us about RGB?                                                      |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=798.4)   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=799.4)   | So I did talk a little bit about RGB earlier and how it corresponds to hex, but there are            |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=803.24)  | a few different ways that you can actually specify RGB values.                                       |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=806.56)  | You can write RGB using numbers or percentages with that optional alpha value for the RGB            |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=811.92)  | with the alpha extension using either a space separated list, as we noted above with CSS4,           |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=818.68)  | or you can write it with commas, which I think is nice because you can see what all these            |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=822.0)   | values are, where they end, delineate.                                                               |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=823.8)   | Anyway, I think there's a time and a place for everything.                                           |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=826.12)  | So if you were to write a basic RGB magenta color, for example, you've probably seen it              |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=830.48)  | like this.                                                                                           |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=831.48)  | RGB 100%, 0%, 100%.                                                                                  |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=835.56)  | Without commas, that would just be RGB 100%, space, 0%, space, 100%.                                 |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=840.84)  | And the 0 to 100% also correlates to 0 to 255.                                                       |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=845.04)  | So that RGB 100, 0, 100 would be the same as RGB 255, 0, 255.                                        |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=853.24)  | And then you can add that alpha value.                                                               |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=855.28)  | So you could do the RGBA, 255, 0, 255, 1, and that 1 would be the alpha value.                       |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=863.16)  | You do have to have the commas there and specify the alpha.                                          |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=865.84)  | Or you can write it in the newer syntax like RGB and then in parentheses, 100%, space,               |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=871.08)  | 0%, space, 100%, and then the slash alpha value, so slash 1.                                         |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=875.96)  | The alpha value can either be a number or a percentage.                                              |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=878.88)  | So in these examples, they're numbers, but you can use a percentage for that as well.                |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=882.6)   | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=883.6)   | So yeah, those are the RGB updates.                                                                  |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=884.6)   | They sound really good.                                                                              |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=885.64)  | Let's talk about HSL, which stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.                               |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=890.76)  | And HSL was created so that humans who are editing and writing and trying to talk about              |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=895.2)   | color have a syntax that hopefully matches more closely to how humans are talking about              |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=900.12)  | it.                                                                                                  |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=901.12)  | And that's pretty much how it won my heart over the past few years.                                  |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=903.24)  | And let's break down what that exactly means here.                                                   |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=904.92)  | It's the colloquial color syntax.                                                                    |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=907.76)  | Good call.                                                                                           |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=908.76)  | I want to quickly, though, define a couple of the aspects of hue, saturation, lightness,             |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=912.88)  | just so we know what we're talking about.                                                            |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=913.92)  | So hue is the color name we'd call out if we saw it in a rainbow, like red, green, blue,             |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=917.8)   | yellow.                                                                                              |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=918.8)   | These are all hues.                                                                                  |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=919.8)   | So think about hues like a clock where the rainbow is all around it, and hue lets us                 |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=924.08)  | point to one of those colors on the clock.                                                           |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=925.68)  | So it's like a hand on the clock.                                                                    |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=926.68)  | Or you think about the color wheel.                                                                  |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=928.16)  | That's your hue.                                                                                     |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=929.26)  | So saturation is about how colorful it is or how vibrant it is.                                      |
| [15:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=934.4)   | Having a lot of saturation would be like a Hawaiian shirt, lots of primary colors, very              |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=938.88)  | bright and vibrant.                                                                                  |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=940.3)   | And having little saturation would mean the color is very gray or very much white or black.          |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=945.44)  | It's lacking colorfulness.                                                                           |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=947.1)   | So if I say I like my clothes to be saturated dark colors, it means I like dark green or             |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=951.88)  | dark blue or dark red colors for my clothes.                                                         |
| [15:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=954.52)  | So then let's talk about lightness.                                                                  |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=956.0)   | Lightness gets a little bit trickier, so I'm going to try to not overcomplicate this.                |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=959.6)   | But lightness is an objective mathematical representation of the visual experience of                |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=963.92)  | light, like white.                                                                                   |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=965.62)  | And in our next episode, we're going to be going into luminance and brightness, not to               |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=969.04)  | be confused with lightness, which are more subjective and contextual ways to get more                |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=973.94)  | specific about lightness and how it's perceived by humans.                                           |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=977.16)  | So for now, think of lightness as how much white is mixed into the color.                            |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=981.2)   | So we have our hue, our saturation, like how vibrant is it?                                          |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=984.14)  | And then how much white do we add to that color?                                                     |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=986.46)  | So all in all, HSL lets me code my color in a language that matches how I talk about color.          |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=991.68)  | And like if I was to talk about red, I could say it's a super saturated light red.                   |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=997.0)   | And then I could go to my code and I could say HSL parenthesis zero, which is red in                 |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1002.28) | the hue spectrum, 90% saying that I want it to be very saturated and 80% saying I want               |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1007.4)  | it to be very light.                                                                                 |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1008.56) | So I could say it's a very light red just by reading the code.                                       |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1012.0)  | Super cool.                                                                                          |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1013.0)  | So the HSL syntax itself, the first parameter there is called a hue, which we've been referencing    |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1018.16) | a lot of times so far as just a number, but it's a number or an angle.                               |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1022.6)  | And it's interesting to talk about these data types that are accepted in the HSL syntax because      |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1027.28) | angle actually represents other data types.                                                          |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1029.76) | It's sort of a parent data type to many others.                                                      |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1031.96) | And we can leverage that to be more expressive and understand our options with the CSS syntax        |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1036.56) | here.                                                                                                |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1037.56) | And so HSL accepts hue as its first parameter, and then it's followed by two percentages.            |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1042.86) | Opacity can be passed as a fourth parameter after a slash.                                           |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1045.6)  | So just like in this new modern syntax.                                                              |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1047.66) | So interestingly, the angle data type accepts degrees, gradients, radians, and turns.                |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1053.84) | And this aligns to the hue clock metaphor that we talked about earlier, right?                       |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1056.56) | If like hue is this angle and it's supposed to be pointing towards something on the color            |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1060.12) | wheel, why not allow us to pass it in in a bunch of different ways?                                  |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1063.2)  | So you could say a color is a quarter turn around the color wheel and then use calc to               |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1068.04) | do another quarter turn or in another quarter turn.                                                  |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1070.76) | I made a code pin about it just so you can see it.                                                   |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1072.7)  | So where I'm passing in into HSL turns as my hue specification, which is really cool                 |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1078.56) | because then I can increment it over time.                                                           |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1080.64) | So some examples of HSL is we have HSL parentheses zero space, 0% space, 0% would be black.          |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1087.8)  | So we have a hue of red with no saturation and it's no white in it.                                  |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1092.28) | So it's fully black.                                                                                 |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1093.44) | Then we have HSL open parentheses half a turn, which would be halfway through the color wheel,       |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1098.88) | almost like a 180 spin on the color wheel.                                                           |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1100.84) | Like you could find a complimentary color with half a turn, 0% and 0%.                               |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1105.0)  | So we're saying as it's still black, but we specified a hue that's halfway around the                |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1109.2)  | hue wheel.                                                                                           |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1110.2)  | And then we have this last one, which is just fun to read, which is HSL open parentheses             |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1114.76) | too rad.                                                                                             |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1115.76) | Yeah, too rad.                                                                                       |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1117.52) | So it's too radians space 50%, space 50%.                                                            |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1121.0)  | So what I'm saying is I want an HSL color that's too radians around the hue angle and                |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1126.4)  | is pretty much like half saturated.                                                                  |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1128.6)  | So a nice bright color in the middle range and then a middle range in terms of lightness             |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1131.7)  | and darkness.                                                                                        |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1132.7)  | So I'd get a pretty bright color, but not super bright.                                              |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1135.04) | And it just sounds like it's too legit to quit.                                                      |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1136.84) | It's too rad.                                                                                        |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1137.84) | Anyway, too rad means 114 degrees, but I just thought that was fun.                                  |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1141.16) | I really like HSL.                                                                                   |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1142.16) | I think it's a really great syntax for people to talk about color in.                                |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1145.14) | It makes sense from a logical perspective.                                                           |
| [19:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1147.4)  | You could do a lot of great calculations with it.                                                    |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1148.92) | I love how you went through all the different ways that we can write hue values around that          |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1153.48) | color wheel because I didn't really realize you could use turns or radians before.                   |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1158.04) | And it just really makes the possibilities even greater for designers and developers                 |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1162.1)  | to sort of work together and create color systems.                                                   |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1164.32) | Yeah, for sure.                                                                                      |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1165.32) | But I want to talk about HWB, which is another color format that stands for hue, whiteness           |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1170.68) | and blackness.                                                                                       |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1172.24) | Note that HWB is not widely supported in HTML yet, but it is suggested as a new standard             |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1177.64) | in Color Level 4.                                                                                    |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1179.04) | However, it was the default in Ubuntu's old color picker and several other operating systems         |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1183.64) | and programs did use this form of color selection.                                                   |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1186.8)  | I think that it's really interesting.                                                                |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1188.6)  | So like HSL, HWB accepts a hue as its first parameter.                                               |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1193.24) | So you could use radians or turns or any of those other values to set the hue.                       |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1197.26) | But here's where the difference comes in.                                                            |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1198.84) | Instead of adjusting saturation and lightness on that hue value, you adjust the whiteness            |
| [20:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1203.52) | and blackness values that are applied to the hue.                                                    |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1207.08) | So it sort of looks like a triangle.                                                                 |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1208.76) | And if you could visualize this, visualize that circle of color and then a triangle within           |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1214.6)  | it.                                                                                                  |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1215.6)  | You have black at the top, white at the bottom, and then the purest hue, which is going to           |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1219.36) | be like you're rotating that triangle around the color wheel at the other end.                       |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1223.64) | So you have this triangle.                                                                           |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1225.28) | You can get this really pure hue value when you don't add any blackness or whiteness,                |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1230.8)  | and that would be the most saturated value that you get.                                             |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1233.64) | So you could turn that, but then you could start applying different colors to it.                    |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1237.64) | If you had HWB 100, 0%, 0%, it would be the most saturated color at the hue angle of 100             |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1245.76) | degrees.                                                                                             |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1246.76) | You could use a degree keyword or just write 100 on its own.                                         |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1249.96) | So that's an option for you there as well.                                                           |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1252.28) | And the inputs here would be a hue value and then two percentages for the percentage of              |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1256.52) | the whiteness and the percentage of the blackness that you are adding to this color.                 |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1261.6)  | The syntax for this is a hue value between 0 and 360.                                                |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1265.46) | That's probably what you're going to use if you're thinking about it in terms of the color           |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1267.52) | wheel, but you can also use radians turns those values.                                              |
| [21:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1271.28) | And they can be space separated or comma separated as with RGBA and HSLA.                            |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1276.32) | You can write HWBA by adding that alpha value if you want to use the comma separated value           |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1281.36) | list, but you don't have to.                                                                         |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1282.92) | If you want to use a space separated, you can write this without commas and have that                |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1286.24) | slashed, you know, the alpha.                                                                        |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1288.28) | So for example, you could write a dark red like HWB 0, 0%, 60%.                                      |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1296.66) | And that would be the same as writing HSL 0, 100%, 20%.                                              |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1301.16) | So if you in your head just wanted to create a darker red, HWB might even be a more understandable   |
| [21:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1306.84) | mental model.                                                                                        |
| [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1308.34) | It just depends on how you are thinking about things with that saturation angle.                     |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1312.6)  | Anyway, it's a differential model, but they're both really cool.                                     |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1315.44) | And that will also be equal to RGB 102, 0, 0, because you're pulling out the value from              |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1319.12) | the red channel that you're trying to equate.                                                        |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1320.96) | Well, sorry, that was so many things.                                                                |
| [22:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1323.32) | These are, you know, in depth color syntax options.                                                  |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1327.32) | I think it's cool to hear about all the things that authors can write with.                          |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1330.8)  | I strongly agree.                                                                                    |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1331.8)  | And I loved you breaking it down there with like a dark red as the context amongst the               |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1335.68) | three.                                                                                               |
| [22:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1336.68) | And seeing the way that the color channels are fluctuating and how they're representing              |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1340.4)  | colors is, I'm learning just listening to you talk about this episode.                               |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1344.28) | So thank you.                                                                                        |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1345.28) | That was really awesome.                                                                             |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1346.36) | So that was all the ways to author color or to code color for the web.                               |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1350.48) | And look at all the options we have, all the convenient syntaxes that the web provides.              |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1354.0)  | I'm pretty impressed.                                                                                |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1355.18) | Not sure if you've seen how other platforms do color, but there's some really funky ones.            |
| [22:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1359.6)  | Objective C. I'm not going to like long say what the colors are because it's some nasty              |
| [22:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1365.36) | code.                                                                                                |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1366.36) | I've had a bad experience.                                                                           |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1367.36) | I've had a few.                                                                                      |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1368.36) | Like I looked at color in the Chromium code base.                                                    |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1371.88) | It's just this huge, funky data type.                                                                |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1373.74) | It's just this big, giant object.                                                                    |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1375.72) | And I really like how we can do hex with three codes.                                                |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1378.36) | Right?                                                                                               |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1379.36) | That's pretty sweet.                                                                                 |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1380.36) | Okay, so that's how we write about color.                                                            |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1382.04) | Let's talk about where you can put these colors, aka like these CSS properties accept colors         |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1387.02) | as values or inputs.                                                                                 |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1388.72) | Where are those at?                                                                                  |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1389.72) | We're not going to have time to share an exhaustive list of where color can go in your CSS.          |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1394.0)  | But here is a pretty good start of where you're probably going to commonly see color and an          |
| [23:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1398.54) | overview to remind you a bit of where you can inject color in your UI.                               |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1402.84) | And the first one is with typography.                                                                |
| [23:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1404.18) | We commonly will be adjusting color for your text color.                                             |
| [23:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1408.28) | That's just the color keyword.                                                                       |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1409.72) | You can also apply shadows that are multicolored.                                                    |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1413.72) | So you could change your shadow color.                                                               |
| [23:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1415.36) | You can change the color of your underline or you can create like a border bottom for                |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1419.3)  | your text that is a different color than the text above it.                                          |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1422.84) | So in typography, you'll see that a lot for the text colors and other things.                        |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1428.04) | Yeah, text, shadows, etc.                                                                            |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1430.42) | Totally agree.                                                                                       |
| [23:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1431.42) | You can change background colors.                                                                    |
| [23:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1432.56) | So of course, you know, just straight up the background color.                                       |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1434.66) | But you also have the option to do a linear gradient as a background.                                |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1437.74) | And that would take two colors.                                                                      |
| [23:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1439.44) | Oh, the complexity climbs.                                                                           |
| [24:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1441.06) | Or more.                                                                                             |
| [24:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1442.06) | Or more, right?                                                                                      |
| [24:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1443.06) | Gradients are dope.                                                                                  |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1444.06) | So also we have borders and outlines that take color.                                                |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1446.82) | Borders will adjust the geometric placement of your object of your subject in your UI.               |
| [24:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1452.72) | So check out our episode in the box model where we talk about borders and outlines and               |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1456.16) | how all those things are related.                                                                    |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1458.84) | And yeah, you can apply color here.                                                                  |
| [24:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1460.2)  | You can even make all your borders different colors if you wanted, because you could specify         |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1463.56) | that on each border.                                                                                 |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1465.04) | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| [24:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1466.04) | Good point.                                                                                          |
| [24:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1467.04) | There's also other types of shadows.                                                                 |
| [24:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1468.04) | So we have like box shadows and drop shadows that accept colors.                                     |
| [24:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1470.24) | So you can make a colorful shadow.                                                                   |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1471.74) | In fact, that is one of my hottest design tips is your shadows should never be black.                |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1476.2)  | Yeah, that's so true, because you don't really have a true black shadow in real life.                |
| [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1480.18) | And that sort of goes back to like painting and how you mix colors for paint.                        |
| [24:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1483.56) | So I like that.                                                                                      |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1484.56) | I love that you brought that up.                                                                     |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1486.0)  | Also gradients, when you use color within gradients, you can have as many colors as                  |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1489.44) | you want, because gradients can be as complex or as simple as you make them.                         |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1493.24) | There's different types of gradients, linear gradients, radial gradients.                            |
| [24:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1496.32) | You can even mix color formats in gradients.                                                         |
| [24:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1498.48) | You can mix HSL with keywords, with RGB.                                                             |
| [25:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1501.4)  | You can even use transparent and the color keywords inside of your gradients.                        |
| [25:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1505.88) | But be aware that if you do use transparent, you might have some variation between browsers          |
| [25:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1510.04) | so just double check or make sure that you're applying a color value for that transparent            |
| [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1513.92) | to come from.                                                                                        |
| [25:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1515.16) | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1516.16) | And then you can also put color on paper.                                                            |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1518.6)  | The web can put color on paper through print.                                                        |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1520.96) | Wow.                                                                                                 |
| [25:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1521.96) | Yeah, people write CSS for print.                                                                    |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1523.48) | That's totally a thing.                                                                              |
| [25:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1524.48) | Right?                                                                                               |
| [25:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1525.48) | Seriously.                                                                                           |
| [25:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1526.48) | And color level four brings us CMYK.                                                                 |
| [25:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1527.48) | So we'll talk about that a little bit in the next episode.                                           |
| [25:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1529.12) | But yeah, you can put it on paper.                                                                   |
| [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1530.8)  | Your color that you're authoring on the web can eventually land on paper.                            |
| [25:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1534.92) | Okay, well, we've got a lastly here is we're going to talk about functions in CSS, not               |
| [25:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1538.96) | to be confused with color functions like you might be using in SAS or if you've seen our             |
| [25:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1542.72) | color spec level five work.                                                                          |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1544.46) | We're not referencing those.                                                                         |
| [25:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1545.68) | These are functions that can be used today with color types.                                         |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1548.96) | They return a modified color or the modify a value that's used in a color definition.                |
| [25:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1553.72) | So like for example, calc is a CSS function that can do math on things with angles, numbers          |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1560.48) | and percentages.                                                                                     |
| [26:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1561.48) | So if you were using HSL, you could use calc to manipulate the degrees or the turns.                 |
| [26:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1566.8)  | And the math is really easy there.                                                                   |
| [26:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1567.88) | You can say point five turns plus point five turns inside of a calc and it will work out             |
| [26:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1571.96) | that that's one whole turn.                                                                          |
| [26:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1573.6)  | Super cool.                                                                                          |
| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1574.6)  | That's awesome.                                                                                      |
| [26:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1575.6)  | You can also use these to lighten and darken the lightness or the saturation that you have           |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1578.7)  | in a color, which is super cool.                                                                     |
| [26:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1580.6)  | And if you're really clever with your calc usage, well not clever, just kind of succinct,            |
| [26:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1584.56) | you can do one calc per custom property and then stack your custom properties later and              |
| [26:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1588.64) | try to keep all these multiple calculations which make a robust color system nice and                |
| [26:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1593.48) | manageable for you.                                                                                  |
| [26:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1594.48) | So anyway, just a little hot tip about calc.                                                         |
| [26:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1596.9)  | I love using calc and I even included in the show notes a code pen in which I used the               |
| [26:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1600.96) | calc function to create an entire color system using custom properties, using these sort             |
| [26:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1605.8)  | of functions and go check that out if you are interested in creating design systems                  |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1610.56) | and color systems through calc and through some of these mathematical measures.                      |
| [26:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1615.88) | You can even use calc to recreate popular Sass functions that don't exist in native                  |
| [27:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1619.52) | CSS like the mix color function.                                                                     |
| [27:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1621.92) | I have a demo there too where you calculate the averages between the colors and then you             |
| [27:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1625.8)  | export them as a CSS custom property.                                                                |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1629.0)  | Super cool to mix calc and custom properties.                                                        |
| [27:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1630.52) | I'll include a link to a demo of that as well in the show notes so check those out if you            |
| [27:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1633.88) | want to see more.                                                                                    |
| [27:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1634.88) | For sure.                                                                                            |
| [27:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1635.88) | And a thing that I also am very excited and interested in are filters on the web.                    |
| [27:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1640.56) | So with CSS filters, you can also make color adjustments and in CSS filters, you can do              |
| [27:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1646.36) | hue rotation, you could adjust saturation, you can adjust lightness and you can adjust               |
| [27:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1651.12) | contrast and all of these things will make adjustments to your UI.                                   |
| [27:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1655.0)  | And the cool thing is with CSS filters, you can apply them to a paragraph for example                |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1660.12) | if you do want to be making color changes to text values, but you can also apply them                |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1664.92) | to list items and images and media like videos and different types of content.                       |
| [27:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1671.04) | So you can really start applying these color changes in many ways in your UIs and you can            |
| [27:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1676.16) | combine those too.                                                                                   |
| [27:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1677.28) | You can use a space separated list to apply saturation and lightness and a hue rotation              |
| [28:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1682.16) | and you can animate them because it's CSS.                                                           |
| [28:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1684.72) | And so just there's so many cool things that you can do with filters and I thought it would          |
| [28:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1688.24) | be a miss to do a show about color without talking about the filters and all the cool                |
| [28:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1691.64) | things you can do with them.                                                                         |
| [28:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1692.84) | So check those out too.                                                                              |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1693.92) | Oh, strong agree.                                                                                    |
| [28:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1694.92) | And I've seen crazy demos where people use CSS filters to do like automatic intelligent              |
| [28:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1700.44) | color contrast so that the text color is always of a high contrast on its background.                |
| [28:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1704.68) | Yeah, the difference filter will do that.                                                            |
| [28:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1706.46) | It's awesome.                                                                                        |
| [28:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1707.46) | So have fun with colors folks and go manipulate them in all these different ways and all these       |
| [28:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1711.16) | different spaces with all these different syntaxes.                                                  |
| [28:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1713.2)  | We're super pumped on them.                                                                          |
| [28:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1714.62) | But like as we kind of close out here, you know, I've seen a lot of these color puns                 |
| [28:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1718.68) | online where people will make words out of hex codes.                                                |
| [28:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1721.28) | Have you seen that?                                                                                  |
| [28:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1722.28) | I have seen them.                                                                                    |
| [28:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1723.28) | What are some of the favorites that you've seen?                                                     |
| [28:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1724.7)  | One of the first ones, well it's not the first one I learned, but somebody called me out             |
| [28:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1727.36) | for using one and I didn't even mean it on purpose, but I'd made a color that had hashtag            |
| [28:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1731.4)  | DAD in it and they were like, you're such a dad now.                                                 |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1733.96) | You're using the dad hex.                                                                            |
| [28:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1734.96) | And I was like, what?                                                                                |
| [28:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1735.96) | I didn't do that.                                                                                    |
| [28:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1736.96) | It's unintentional, I swear.                                                                         |
| [28:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1738.98) | But I also like hashtag C55 because CSS, right?                                                      |
| [29:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1742.6)  | Ooh, it's leet, CSS and leet.                                                                        |
| [29:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1745.0)  | What color does that end up looking like?                                                            |
| [29:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1746.64) | I have no idea.                                                                                      |
| [29:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1747.96) | Oh, it's like a reddish, like a desaturated fire brick red.                                          |
| [29:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1753.04) | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| [29:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1754.04) | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [29:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1755.04) | Well now I know what you mean because we studied that.                                               |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1756.04) | Okay, that's great.                                                                                  |
| [29:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1757.04) | Oh, that's funny.                                                                                    |
| [29:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1758.04) | I don't even know what most of these are.                                                            |
| [29:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1759.04) | Although I could guess what 007 is.                                                                  |
| [29:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1760.5)  | So hashtag 007 has got to be some sort of really dark, dark gray.                                    |
| [29:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1764.04) | And then the last one I have here is hashtag 600613 because it's Google and leet.                    |
| [29:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1770.64) | What are your favorites, Yuna?                                                                       |
| [29:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1771.64) | That's so cute.                                                                                      |
| [29:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1772.64) | My favorite is 5AD because it's sad and it's blue.                                                   |
| [29:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1780.52) | It matches the color so well.                                                                        |
| [29:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1782.52) | But I've also heard coffee a lot.                                                                    |
| [29:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1783.98) | That's like C0FFEE, which looks very much like coffee.                                               |
| [29:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1789.74) | And there's also like LOL with 101.                                                                  |
| [29:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1792.48) | So there's a bunch of them.                                                                          |
| [29:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1794.16) | We have a link in the show notes we'll put in there that has a whole list of these color             |
| [29:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1798.24) | puns.                                                                                                |
| [29:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WcgqRbtXg6j6N9GEO96ve?&t=1799.24) | All of them are six or three digit though.                                                           |
