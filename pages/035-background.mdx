| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS Podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=17.88)   | Today's show is going to be a little back to basics to go over background.                           |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=22.68)   | Background basically describes what's behind the internal content of an element.                     |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=27.02)   | What's behind it?                                                                                    |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=28.02)   | It could be a solid color, an image, an animated GIF, or an SVG.                                     |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=31.8)    | There might not even be content overlaying a background, and it's just something that                |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=36.06)   | we see taking the full space of that element.                                                        |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=38.96)   | That's pretty common too.                                                                            |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=40.38)   | So in today's episode, we'll go over the details of how to set backgrounds just the way you          |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=44.6)    | want them and how to make some pretty cool effects too.                                              |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=47.44)   | Agreed.                                                                                              |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=48.44)   | There are a lot of cool effects.                                                                     |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=49.82)   | There's lots of tricks.                                                                              |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=50.82)   | There's lots of things to know here.                                                                 |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=52.76)   | And yeah, let's cover it all.                                                                        |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=54.2)    | I'm really excited about this one.                                                                   |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=55.24)   | I feel like this unlocks a whole bunch of stuff knowing these.                                       |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=58.6)    | So background, it's like layers of paint and not like a top coat, but an underpainting               |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=63.6)    | or like a primer layer.                                                                              |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=65.26)   | It's pretty low in the stack in the context of like painting, because if you think about             |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=69.08)   | borders and your text, like those are all going to clearly go on top of this.                        |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=74.4)    | But there's also a base background color versus your background images.                              |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=78.76)   | So there's lots of layers to be aware of here.                                                       |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=81.52)   | And layers, and you know, I'm saying that plural, you can have multiple layers that                  |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=86.68)   | interact with each other with transparency and gradients and SVG and it just gets really             |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=92.08)   | cool.                                                                                                |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=93.08)   | So I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but these are the sort of like essentials of all            |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=96.64)   | these potentials.                                                                                    |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=97.72)   | So would you take us a little further, Yuna?                                                         |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=99.96)   | Well, the first property for background is just background color.                                    |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=104.28)  | And this accepts any base color value.                                                               |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=106.92)  | So that could be, you know, HSL, RGB, hex value.                                                     |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=110.12)  | It could have transparency in it, but it is a good old color value for your background               |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=116.24)  | color.                                                                                               |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=117.24)  | Right.                                                                                               |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=118.24)  | And you can't pass a gradient there, right?                                                          |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=120.04)  | Like colors aren't gradients?                                                                        |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=121.96)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=122.96)  | Gradients are known as images.                                                                       |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=124.76)  | So you can't set anything but a color value for the background color property, but you               |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=129.6)   | could use the general property of background and then set either there.                              |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=133.56)  | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=134.56)  | I bring that up because it tricks me all the time where I'm like in a background image               |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=138.18)  | and I want to have a solid color and I can't just say blue or black.                                 |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=142.44)  | I just can't.                                                                                        |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=143.44)  | Anyway, so.                                                                                          |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=144.44)  | Yeah, they're separated out.                                                                         |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=145.44)  | They're separated out.                                                                               |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=146.44)  | So the next property we're going to talk about is background image.                                  |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=148.86)  | So we're kind of leading into that and this is for supplying, you guessed it, a background           |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=152.36)  | image for the element, but it's definitely not limited to that.                                      |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=156.78)  | It's got tons of additional powers.                                                                  |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=158.96)  | And so while the property name is singular background image, it is not singular in its               |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=163.76)  | abilities.                                                                                           |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=165.26)  | You can have N layers.                                                                               |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=166.56)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=167.56)  | As many as you want and N sources can be used from URLs, gradients.                                  |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=172.64)  | Any mix of layer types can be stacked here.                                                          |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=175.08)  | So like a tip is like we were just talking about putting a solid color into a background             |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=178.5)   | image is you can use a linear gradient that's just from the same color to the same color             |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=184.88)  | and you just tricked the background image into painting a solid color.                               |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=188.14)  | So that's sort of how you can intermingle solid colors and background images in this                 |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=194.8)   | way.                                                                                                 |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=195.8)   | It's kind of cool.                                                                                   |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=196.8)   | And you could definitely use the background property as well to have multiple backgrounds.           |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=201.08)  | And that's kind of what I was talking about where you have multiple different backgrounds.           |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=204.98)  | You could have transparent images or you could blend those backgrounds, which we'll talk             |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=208.44)  | about a little bit further down in the episode.                                                      |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=211.68)  | So keep listening.                                                                                   |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=212.68)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=213.68)  | But the next value we have is background position and this is how you position your background.      |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=217.42)  | So you're probably going to be using this more likely with a background image, like                  |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=220.62)  | an image value or a gradient where you want to set where that image or background lives.             |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=229.32)  | So this is 0, 0 by default, which is the top left.                                                   |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=232.24)  | And you can also use percentages or keywords for this.                                               |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=235.48)  | The keywords are top, right, bottom, left, or center for positioning your background                 |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=240.44)  | position.                                                                                            |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=242.04)  | And I also mentioned the percentage value.                                                           |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=244.2)   | So you could set like a 50% as a value in here.                                                      |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=248.68)  | And background position accepts either one or two values.                                            |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=252.32)  | If you have one argument here, then the second argument is assumed to center.                        |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=257.44)  | So the center will be the default for that axis.                                                     |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=262.92)  | And then if you specify two values, the first is always going to be horizontal.                      |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=268.28)  | So you're going to set horizontal and then vertical, just like you do with, we did overflow          |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=275.2)   | in the last episode.                                                                                 |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=276.2)   | We talked about how you're setting the horizontal and vertical overflow.                             |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=279.22)  | So this is sort of the same where you set horizontal and then vertical.                              |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=281.52)  | A lot of CSS is like this, where you set X and then Y, like margin to a lot of things.               |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=287.16)  | So here you are setting the X and Y values for the positioning of your background.                   |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=293.84)  | You could just do background position 50% and also have that sort of be center, center.              |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=297.36)  | And you can write center, center.                                                                    |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=299.1)   | That is a valid value for background position too, or just center once.                              |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=303.4)   | And it's sort of the same thing because second is a super center.                                    |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=306.4)   | So yes, that is background positioning.                                                              |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=308.9)   | And what is the next property for background?                                                        |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=310.88)  | Hey, that was nice coverage.                                                                         |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=312.16)  | There is a lot of options inside of just like shifting, you know, like the car around the            |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=317.48)  | box in the image.                                                                                    |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=318.48)  | Like if we had a background image of a car or something like that.                                   |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=321.52)  | So anyway, you did that well.                                                                        |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=323.04)  | And you even covered the one use case where I just made a tweet and like 90% of everyone             |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=327.16)  | failed, which was if you have two values, you have to start with horizontal.                         |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=330.84)  | Oh man, that one's so tricky.                                                                        |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=332.94)  | So glad you covered it.                                                                              |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=334.08)  | Let's talk about background size.                                                                    |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=336.08)  | And so this is about how much of the elements space should this background consume.                  |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=341.6)   | It's a lot like background fit.                                                                      |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=343.84)  | This works with multiple backgrounds with commas, like the other props that we're talking            |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=347.84)  | about here today.                                                                                    |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=348.84)  | It accepts links or percentages.                                                                     |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=351.2)   | So REMS, M pixels, 50%, they all work as a way for you to size this image and how it                 |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=356.44)  | fits into the box.                                                                                   |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=357.44)  | But you do need to pass a pair of sizes or a keyword.                                                |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=361.16)  | So it knows how both width and height should fit.                                                    |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=364.12)  | It's also got some handy keywords for really common use cases that I tend to use these               |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=368.2)   | all the time, which is contain and cover.                                                            |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=371.48)  | And the default is auto.                                                                             |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=373.72)  | Yeah, I feel like with background fit, it also is very similar to object fit.                        |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=378.64)  | I mean, background size and object fit because you have like the containing how you want             |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=382.76)  | it to fill the space.                                                                                |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=383.76)  | So that is a key thing to know.                                                                      |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=385.8)   | There's also background repeats.                                                                     |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=387.18)  | And I think background repeat is actually one of the coolest things about this episode               |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=390.64)  | because I just I didn't realize how many different repeat options we have.                           |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=394.72)  | Adam shared a link when we were praying the show notes and it was to the CSS tricks article          |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=398.48)  | that had demos of this.                                                                              |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=400.36)  | Just like seeing it live is pretty cool.                                                             |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=402.64)  | It's amazing looking.                                                                                |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=403.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=404.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=405.64)  | I tend to just use background repeat, like repeat.                                                   |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=409.24)  | But there's also space and round, which can manipulate your image to fit the space in                |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=413.92)  | interesting ways.                                                                                    |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=414.92)  | Like you can do with border image.                                                                   |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=417.36)  | So we'll get to that in a second.                                                                    |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=418.76)  | But let's go over all those options first.                                                           |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=420.38)  | So the first option is background repeat, no repeat.                                                 |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=424.0)   | So this just says don't have the image show once.                                                    |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=426.64)  | Don't repeat it.                                                                                     |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=427.64)  | And that is very useful for things like icons and other backgrounds.                                 |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=430.84)  | I use this one all the time.                                                                         |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=433.0)   | Then there's repeat X, which will tile the image on the X axis.                                      |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=436.6)   | So if it overflows the first image size, then it'll tile it.                                         |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=442.64)  | And if the last item doesn't fit the container, it's just going to cut it off.                       |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=446.86)  | So you could think of it as like tiling a floor in a bathroom.                                       |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=449.28)  | You're going to cut it to fit the wall.                                                              |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=451.24)  | And that's what the last item will be.                                                               |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=453.76)  | Similarly, there's repeat Y, which will tile the image on the Y axis.                                |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=458.4)   | And there's repeat, which tiles the image in both directions.                                        |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=462.04)  | I think that this one is the default value, the repeat value, where you're just getting              |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=466.28)  | the X and Y tiled.                                                                                   |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=468.28)  | So space is where it gets interesting because space will actually do this neat thing where           |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=476.16)  | as you're moving it around to space it, it's going to fill extra space between the items,            |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=485.2)   | like between the background image, until you can fit a full image into that space.                   |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=490.64)  | When the space between the two images on the background is wide enough to fit another one            |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=495.36)  | of the background images, then it's going to pop another one in there.                               |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=499.16)  | So that's kind of like a fun one.                                                                    |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=501.36)  | And then there's background repeat round, which will increase the size of the image                  |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=507.4)   | until you could fit another image in there.                                                          |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=510.6)   | And this one reminds me of grid a lot, like the auto fit with the grid where you give                |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=515.2)   | it some space and it will sort of auto fit the background into this space that you have.             |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=522.68)  | And it's really cool.                                                                                |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=524.02)  | So we'll share a link in the show notes to just this article that kind of lets you play              |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=528.06)  | around with it and see what that looks like and then explore on your own.                            |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=534.72)  | So you can write those individually or you can kind of write them as a two value syntax              |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=541.36)  | and set background repeat block and inline the X and Y axes separately.                              |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=546.2)   | So you can write something like background repeat round space, space, round space, like              |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=552.68)  | two values.                                                                                          |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=554.38)  | So you can set those individually.                                                                   |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=555.92)  | There's also a specific value for background repeat X, which is background dash repeat               |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=560.96)  | dash X and background repeat Y to set those individually as their own properties.                    |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=566.28)  | But when I tested these in the latest Chromium, they only worked for repeat and no repeat            |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=571.4)   | values.                                                                                              |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=572.4)   | I was unable to set background repeat X to round or space.                                           |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=575.52)  | But you can set it when you use a background repeat property as a shorthand.                         |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=578.28)  | So I don't know if this is a bug or what's going on here, but I did notice that.                     |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=581.6)   | So be aware.                                                                                         |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=582.6)   | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=583.6)   | So I had the same revelation you did sort of right there where space and round are a                 |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=590.2)   | lot like autofill versus autofit and grid, aren't they?                                              |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=594.24)  | Wow, very nice.                                                                                      |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=595.24)  | Thank you for that.                                                                                  |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=596.64)  | The next property is background origin.                                                              |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=599.6)   | And this one got me recently.                                                                        |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=601.24)  | So I'm a little fiery about it, but I like it now that I know what it is.                            |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=606.0)   | I don't know why this had never even come up once for me.                                            |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=609.0)   | If it did, I blocked it out.                                                                         |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=610.0)   | Anyway, OK.                                                                                          |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=611.0)   | So now that the size is being computed for the image, we can think back to our box model             |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=614.8)   | about content box, padding box, et cetera.                                                           |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=617.4)   | And the size of the paintable area is different for each of these boxes.                             |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=621.12)  | So background origin is for specifying which of those boxes you want to fill with these              |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=624.76)  | background images.                                                                                   |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=625.76)  | Right.                                                                                               |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=626.76)  | And each image can fill a different box if you wanted to.                                            |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=628.96)  | Now I was forced to learn this because I thought I'd run into a browser bug when I made a            |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=632.96)  | gradient for just like a square and added a transparent border.                                      |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=636.6)   | Now I assumed the transparent border would just overlay the gradient and have this nice              |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=640.88)  | sort of elegant intermixing of colors and stuff.                                                     |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=644.76)  | But turned out it didn't because the default value for background origin is padding box,             |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=649.28)  | not border box.                                                                                      |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=650.56)  | Padding box doesn't include the border.                                                              |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=652.3)   | So the gradient wasn't sized to fit with the border.                                                 |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=654.98)  | So I had to specify that my background origin on my gradient, my background image gradient           |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=660.64)  | was background origin, border box, not padding box.                                                  |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=665.08)  | Padding box is the default.                                                                          |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=666.58)  | Which is weird because background clips default is border box.                                       |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=669.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=670.16)  | Apparently it was like this old compat issue where they know that the optimal option is              |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=675.02)  | border box but it's just like it's like in stone.                                                    |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=679.7)   | So yeah.                                                                                             |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=680.7)   | So that one got me.                                                                                  |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=682.48)  | And now I know this I guess is like anytime I'm trying to fill the background of a box               |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=686.64)  | just like with box sizing border box, how we want to set that everywhere because that's              |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=690.08)  | the mentality.                                                                                       |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=691.28)  | You can probably in your style sheet write background origin border box for everything               |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=696.72)  | and sort of set that as a normalize or a reset if you want to.                                       |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=699.56)  | Anyway, okay.                                                                                        |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=700.56)  | So tangent away.                                                                                     |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=702.36)  | Background origin accepts these different values.                                                    |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=704.04)  | It accepts padding box.                                                                              |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=705.32)  | So you can draw the background image to adjust the padding box.                                      |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=707.6)   | You can specify the border box.                                                                      |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=709.28)  | That will extend a little bit further.                                                               |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=710.44)  | Or you could say the content box and it'd be a little bit more restricted.                           |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=713.96)  | I have a note here that if the background attachment is fixed then the origin doesn't                |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=718.56)  | matter because you're no longer fixing to the box that you're trying to size within.                 |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=722.84)  | You're sizing to a fixed position like the viewport.                                                 |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=725.28)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=726.28)  | And there's a CSS trick here where you can do a pseudo like border image effect by cleverly          |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=730.12)  | painting certain origins.                                                                            |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=731.76)  | So you could paint just the padding box and then put you know like a solid color in the              |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=738.16)  | content box and make it look like you have this really interesting border but it's just              |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=742.36)  | an illusion because of the way that you're strategically filling each background's origin.           |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=748.08)  | Anyway it's a really weird feature that seems really useful once I knew what it was.                 |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=752.76)  | There are so many different ways to do borders and outline like there's box shadow, there's          |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=756.72)  | this, there's lots of different ways.                                                                |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=759.08)  | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=760.08)  | We had a whole borders episode too so if you're interested in borders and what the slicing           |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=763.72)  | and all that means then check out our borders episode.                                               |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=767.04)  | Good call.                                                                                           |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=768.04)  | So next is background clip and this sets whether an element's background extends underneath          |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=772.46)  | its border box, padding box, or content box which Adam just went over.                               |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=776.56)  | So if you want more about these different boxes and where they live inside of an element             |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=781.8)   | check out our box model episode for more distinction.                                                |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=784.56)  | That is one of our first episodes that we did and we kind of we go through what all                  |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=787.88)  | this means.                                                                                          |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=788.92)  | So with background clip the default initial value is border box as I mentioned.                      |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=793.76)  | So this would extend the background to the entire area of the element through to the                 |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=798.16)  | edge of the border.                                                                                  |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=799.68)  | So if you will visualize this with me for a second.                                                  |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=802.32)  | If you have an element with a dashed or dotted border and you have a background on that element      |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=807.72)  | you would see the background in between those dashes or in between the dots all the way              |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=812.28)  | to the edge of the elements.                                                                         |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=815.6)   | So then there's padding box as the background clip value.                                            |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=819.38)  | With a padding box value on background clip that would stop the background right before              |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=824.48)  | that border so you wouldn't see it behind those dashes or behind the dots.                           |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=829.14)  | It would sort of end right before it.                                                                |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=830.96)  | Then we have content box which would only cover the background of the element's content              |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=835.42)  | so it would not include its padding.                                                                 |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=837.38)  | The padding would not get the background value.                                                      |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=840.4)   | And finally there's a text value.                                                                    |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=842.28)  | You can do background clip text.                                                                     |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=844.88)  | So background clip text enables you to set a background on the foreground text of an                 |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=849.72)  | element.                                                                                             |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=850.92)  | So this is kind of funky.                                                                            |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=852.12)  | To use this you need to combine it with a semi-transparent or transparent text color.                |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=856.84)  | So you could set like color transparent on the text and then a background clip text so               |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=862.0)   | that you would actually see the background behind the text because if you don't have                 |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=864.64)  | a transparent value there you're not going to see it, you're just going to see the text              |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=868.0)   | color.                                                                                               |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=869.34)  | Also this is supported in all modern browsers but you need to combine it with a WebKit prefix.       |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=875.12)  | So you have to write like dash WebKit dash background clip text for it to work in Safari             |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=879.8)   | and Chromium.                                                                                        |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=880.84)  | So this is a cool way to set interesting background effects by using images or gradients behind      |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=885.78)  | your text with background clip text.                                                                 |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=888.12)  | Very cool.                                                                                           |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=890.44)  | Another thing just the way you explained it really illuminated it there.                             |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=893.4)   | I was really curious this whole time why I had to use color transparent but now it makes             |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=897.0)   | more sense when I'm thinking about these layers of paint, right?                                     |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=900.4)   | What we're specifying is you can clip this text to this background paint but if you're               |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=905.28)  | also painting text color on top of that you just paint it over top of the work.                      |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=911.2)   | So you have to set it to transparent so that you're not competing with the other layer               |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=915.52)  | of paint.                                                                                            |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=916.52)  | Wow, seems so obvious now.                                                                           |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=920.44)  | Okay the next one is background attachment and I love this one but it is so easy to get              |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=926.0)   | wrong or make look terrible.                                                                         |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=928.36)  | And this lets you interact with scroll in some interesting ways.                                     |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=931.88)  | So if the background attachment value is fixed it's when the background image should not             |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=936.16)  | move during the scroll of the element.                                                               |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=939.98)  | It's positioned statically with the viewport and not the element.                                    |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=943.34)  | So this is kind of like hard to describe but if you think of background of clouds with               |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=947.38)  | some text on it and scroll the page in your mind and watch the text scroll up and off                |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=951.64)  | the page while the clouds remain still the background is fixed.                                      |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=956.48)  | But that example kind of sells it short.                                                             |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=958.08)  | Like here's one of my favorite use cases a fixed background gradient where individual                |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=961.72)  | icons headings or whatever share the gradient for paint in their backgrounds.                        |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=965.62)  | So it's like okay okay imagine four icons one in each color of the page or a box and                 |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=970.38)  | imagine a gradient covering the page that's blue on top and red on bottom.                           |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=973.98)  | The icons would be red the top icons would be red and the bottom icons would be blue                 |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=979.48)  | if they were filled with the same fixed background gradient.                                         |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=982.8)   | So it's like the gradient flows through the page but it's only revealed by the icons which           |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=987.88)  | opt into it and it makes just this really unique effect.                                             |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=992.18)  | It's kind of like a mask.                                                                            |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=993.88)  | A background attachment of local is you can also attach locally where fixed attached the             |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=999.72)  | background to the viewport local attaches to the entirety of the elements scrollable                 |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1004.68) | size.                                                                                                |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1005.68) | So like imagine a box that's scrollable and you wanted a gradient to go from red at the              |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1008.68) | top to blue at the bottom but not the bottom of the box but the bottom of the scrollable             |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1013.82) | area like all the way past the text.                                                                 |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1016.52) | That's local attachment.                                                                             |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1017.66) | It's like saying I want to paint the scrollable surface I'm a viewport into not paint my box.        |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1024.28) | And then there's background attachment scroll which is the default and that's it's attached          |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1028.52) | to the element and nothing else.                                                                     |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1030.96) | I remember when background attachment fixed was pretty new there was this really cool                |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1036.24) | demo that I saw and it was like someone's portfolio website and as you scrolled down                 |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1041.96) | they it was kind of like a paper doll effect where they kind of like had an image of themselves      |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1046.72) | and then as you scrolled their outfit changed but not their face and body like just the              |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1051.6)  | clothes.                                                                                             |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1052.6)  | Cool.                                                                                                |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1053.6)  | It was so cool to see and that was like a really cool example like background attachment             |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1056.46) | fixed that I thought was neat and that's also what helps enable some of these parallax effects       |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1060.84) | of like the background being static and then you scroll through.                                     |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1065.22) | So next we have background blend mode and I love blend modes.                                        |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1068.4)  | I think this one's really fun.                                                                       |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1069.66) | So with background blend mode you're describing how you want to blend multiple backgrounds           |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1073.86) | together.                                                                                            |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1074.86) | So you would have multiple backgrounds defined.                                                      |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1077.46) | You could have like a gradient over an image or vice versa an image over a gradient or               |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1081.8)  | you could have two images that you're blending and this would allow for you to specify how           |
| [18:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1086.44) | you are blending those values.                                                                       |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1088.96) | So unlike the mixed blend mode property background blend mode scopes the blending values to just     |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1094.56) | the element itself.                                                                                  |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1096.36) | It only blends those backgrounds and it doesn't interact with any other elements that may            |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1100.4)  | be overlapping it on the screen.                                                                     |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1102.96) | The values this accepts are normal, multiply, screen, overlay, darken, lighten, color dodge,         |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1110.04) | color burn, hard light, soft light, difference, exclusion, hue, saturation, color and luminosity.    |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1118.32) | And for more information about what each of those values means we did a whole show all               |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1123.44) | about blend modes.                                                                                   |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1125.26) | It is episode 24, season 1 episode 24 where we go into depth about what those all mean               |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1132.8)  | and including more about this background blend property.                                             |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1137.28) | So another thing to note is that blend modes are either on or off.                                   |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1140.16) | You can only set one at a time and they're not interoperable meaning you can't animate               |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1143.8)  | them.                                                                                                |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1144.8)  | So you're only describing how those backgrounds blend together and that is kind of like a            |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1150.3)  | all or nothing thing.                                                                                |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1151.3)  | It's how I'm blending which is different than filters because filters you're setting like            |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1153.92) | a percent value on an image and here you're setting blending and I use these a lot.                  |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1158.96) | I think they're useful and cool and make interesting effects.                                        |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1162.48) | Definitely definitely interesting effects.                                                           |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1163.92) | I feel like every really cool like TV show intro uses a couple of these effects that                 |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1169.36) | we've talked about here.                                                                             |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1170.36) | One of them is these background blend modes, right?                                                  |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1172.0)  | There's always really fun interacting layers going on and then there's almost always some            |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1177.16) | masked text, right?                                                                                  |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1178.16) | Where they've got like a background image it's like and then yeah the name of the show               |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1181.86) | comes in.                                                                                            |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1182.86) | It's all slow.                                                                                       |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1184.36) | Anyway, that's just how Adam thinks when he's watching TV.                                           |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1187.4)  | I'm like this is just CSS.                                                                           |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1189.56) | I've got one meta thing about backgrounds in here I wanted to talk about which is the                |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1193.36) | so it's like I'm calling it canvas versus HTML versus body backgrounds and so follow                 |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1199.92) | me in your mind really quick and you hit enter on a URL and what color do you first see before       |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1204.68) | anything else loads and that's the canvas color.                                                     |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1207.76) | That's the infinite canvas that the browser sort of puts behind your page.                           |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1212.12) | Now you can tint that or change it because what will happen is your style sheet loads,               |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1216.32) | the page draws and then you scroll up and you get that like bounce scroll.                           |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1220.8)  | You'll be able to see the canvas color again and has it changed.                                     |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1224.0)  | If your page has specified a body color it will propagate up into the canvas.                        |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1228.76) | It will also propagate an HTML or root background color that you specify and propagate those         |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1233.36) | up but the specs says if you want to do it the way that they suggest just change your                |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1236.98) | body background color and they will populate that up into the infinite canvas of the browser.        |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1241.48) | So just like a fun little you can tint the background color of the browser window.                   |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1247.12) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1248.3)  | I must say I've never really thought about that like why is it always typically white                |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1253.16) | when you land on a web page before anything loads like that first split second.                      |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1257.48) | It's your user agent and that's like I'm glad you brought that up because if you use the             |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1262.6)  | new color scheme dark property in your CSS or you have the meta property it will swap                |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1267.68) | you to the user agent dark theme and you will not load a white background canvas you will            |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1272.56) | load a dark background canvas so that when you're in dark mode on your phone at night                |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1277.24) | you don't see a flash of white for every web page that you visit you see a flash of dark             |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1281.56) | black and then the canvas will get tinted by body.                                                   |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1285.6)  | Interesting.                                                                                         |
| [21:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1286.6)  | Never never thought of it.                                                                           |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1288.76) | One last property that we should mention here is the background property which is a shorthand        |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1293.56) | for all of these values that we talked about today.                                                  |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1296.84) | If you want to write these all in one line you can do that with background and so the                |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1301.92) | way that works is you write background.                                                              |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1304.24) | The first argument value there is background image then background position so this could            |
| [21:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1309.2)  | be one or more values like we mentioned it could be like top left or center center top               |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1314.04) | center and then there's a slash between the background position and background size and              |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1320.4)  | that's because you get that background size to a specific value like 200 pixels or 300               |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1325.6)  | pixels and you could do like 400 px space 400 px for that size that you're referencing               |
| [22:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1329.84) | there and you can also for background position set like a pixel value inside so there's a            |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1334.08) | slash between those.                                                                                 |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1335.36) | There's background image background position slash forward slash specifically then there's           |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1340.52) | background size and then after that it's background repeat what your repeat is background attachment |
| [22:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1346.8)  | how your background attachment is background origin background clip and then finally background      |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1353.28) | color.                                                                                               |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1354.76) | So it's image position forward slash size repeat attachment origin clip color you can                |
| [22:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1359.2)  | set this all together.                                                                               |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1361.08) | So what this also reminds me of is that when you are setting background values you could             |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1365.52) | have background you know image and then color but color will be behind the image and that's          |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1371.16) | important when you're using blending but when you have a linear gradient or any kind of              |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1375.84) | gradient I don't know why I said linear any kind of gradient is treated as an image so               |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1379.16) | you can layer that where you want.                                                                   |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1382.08) | So the color is going to go last when you have a set of multiple backgrounds just sort               |
| [23:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1387.64) | of keep that in mind and for the background property this is all going to be space separated         |
| [23:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1392.4)  | but when you are setting multiple backgrounds you want to comma separate your multiple background    |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1396.84) | URL values except for that last value which is a color you could have an optional comma              |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1402.4)  | there because it is kind of set as like background images and then your background color and         |
| [23:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1408.0)  | that's the way that the background property thinks of it it separates the images from                |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1412.16) | the color.                                                                                           |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1413.52) | So hopefully that was a little quick review about how background works just a review with            |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1420.44) | a shorthand but I feel like a lot of the information here is interesting and new and valuable and    |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1424.8)  | useful and things that you probably deal with pretty regularly as a CSS developer UI developer.      |
| [23:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1430.56) | I agree.                                                                                             |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6m1VpH4sIiBksEsaYcm5vR?&t=1431.56) | So we got to the end there you could do so much with backgrounds I want to thank you                 |
