| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z index.           |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=17.44)  | This is the last episode in our special mini series all about DevTools and how you can            |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=22.04)  | use them to debug and build your UIs.                                                             |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=24.96)  | And to do that we have a special guest, our DevTools specialist, Jesslyn Yee.                     |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=29.24)  | Today's show is all about interaction and interaction inspection and debugging in DevTools.       |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=35.36)  | So I'll just kick it off.                                                                         |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=37.28)  | Something that we like to educate around are prefers media queries and one of them is             |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=43.16)  | prefers reduced motion.                                                                           |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=45.38)  | So if you want to support users who don't love a lot of loud animation and motion in              |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=49.88)  | their interfaces, you can design for this user with the prefers reduced motion preference         |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=54.8)   | query.                                                                                            |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=55.84)  | And to try out what it looks like in the rendering panel of DevTools, there's an emulate prefers  |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=60.14)  | reduced motion option.                                                                            |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=61.84)  | So you could see what your site experience looks like for those people who prefer reduced         |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=65.8)   | motion, and then you can toggle it off to see what the default experience looks like.             |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=70.28)  | What I personally like to do is to design with the prefers reduced motion option as               |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=74.7)   | the default experience and then progressively enhance motion onto it.                             |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=78.98)  | So you could set a preference query for does not prefer reduced motion and then apply your        |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=85.72)  | enhanced motion experience there.                                                                 |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=87.48)  | I know that Adam also likes to say prefers reduced motion doesn't mean no motion.                 |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=92.16)  | So make sure that you have some kind of indicator for your users that things are moving around    |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=96.96)  | because motion is still an important part of helping users navigate a digital space.              |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=101.8)  | So check out prefers reduced motion, check out the DevTools feature for it.                       |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=106.16) | Adam has some great demos as well.                                                                |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=107.56) | I have some demos.                                                                                |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=108.56) | We'll link them in the show notes and then you could check out what that might look like.         |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=112.3)  | Nice feature.                                                                                     |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=113.3)  | When designing our site, we might want to style an element when users mouse over it               |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=118.92) | or add some shadow when users focus on it.                                                        |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=121.88) | We use pseudo-class like hover and focus to achieve that.                                         |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=127.08) | To make designing more efficient, you can simulate this pseudo-class with DevTools.               |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=132.16) | Click on the H-O-V button in the styles pane.                                                     |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=135.86) | Then you can toggle the pseudo-class that you want to force.                                      |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=139.84) | You can select one or more of them.                                                               |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=142.04) | Quite convenient.                                                                                 |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=143.04) | Super convenient and kind of critical at times when like you're looking at a child element        |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=147.68) | that needs the shadow when you're hovering over a parent element and you can just click           |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=151.56) | on the parent element in the elements panel, force a hover and then click on your child           |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=156.68) | element and go edit some styles while the parent is being hovered and it just sort of             |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=160.08) | freezes in time or it like freezes during this interaction and you get to go style based          |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=166.86) | on that frozen interaction.                                                                       |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=168.24) | It's kind of priceless.                                                                           |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=170.16) | Very cool feature to introduce there, Jessalyn.                                                   |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=171.96) | Well, it's because you can't be in a hover state and open DevTools at the same time so            |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=175.48) | you kind of rely on these features.                                                               |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=177.48) | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=178.48) | You only got one mouse cursor, right?                                                             |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=180.36) | Another one that's hard is, yeah, programmatic focus on an element.                               |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=182.8)  | So sometimes you have JavaScript that's calling focus on something due to an event somewhere      |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=186.2)  | else, right?                                                                                      |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=187.2)  | Like they click a button, you show a pop-up and you need to put focus somewhere.                  |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=190.56) | You can test this in DevTools so without running your entire script and without clicking your     |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=194.6)  | button, you can test causing focus by right clicking the element and finding the focus            |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=200.04) | menu item.                                                                                        |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=201.04) | And this will do the same thing as if you called it from JavaScript the whole time,               |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=204.48) | you know, like dot focus parentheses.                                                             |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=207.0)  | And I find this is really great for testing.                                                      |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=209.38) | Another one that's really fun is element modification breakpoints.                                |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=212.84) | This one actually can make you look like a super hacker.                                          |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=215.86) | It's awesome.                                                                                     |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=216.86) | You right click on an element in the elements panel and you go to break on DOM tree modification. |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=224.02) | And this will let you know when lines of code have triggered changes on that element.             |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=229.68) | So consider scenarios where a class name is changing or an attribute is being modified            |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=234.24) | on an element and you don't know the code that's doing it.                                        |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=237.6)  | Oh no, how will I find out?                                                                       |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=239.16) | Like there's so much code in this app.                                                            |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=240.64) | How did this class name change?                                                                   |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=242.2)  | And well, you just right click it, you can set this break on tree modification and when           |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=247.64) | it changes, it will take you right to where the line of code was.                                 |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=251.28) | And so this has made me look like a super debugger before because I step into a code              |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=254.76) | base that I have no idea how it works.                                                            |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=256.52) | I've never been inside it before and I can track things down super fast without knowing           |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=260.76) | anything.                                                                                         |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=261.76) | Just because I back trace from the element to the code instead of looking for the code            |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=266.16) | that's touching the element.                                                                      |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=267.34) | So a couple of cool tips right there.                                                             |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=269.56) | Super debugger.                                                                                   |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=270.56) | I love that.                                                                                      |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=271.56) | So speaking of debugging and cross browser debugging specifically, did you know that              |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=276.88) | you could emulate missing image formats in dev tools like AVIF and WebP?                          |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=282.36) | It's always a good idea to send the most optimized images to your users to reduce page weight     |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=286.16) | and in cruft.                                                                                     |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=287.16) | And two of the most efficient formats out there today are AVIF and WebP.                          |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=291.88) | And you can use these formats for either static or interactive and animated content.              |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=296.08) | We use AVIF sprites all over the design center website, for example.                              |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=300.28) | But unfortunately, AVIF isn't supported in all modern browsers and WebP might be missing          |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=305.6)  | from some older browsers.                                                                         |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=307.6)  | But have no fear, dev tools is here.                                                              |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=309.98) | You can still send AVIF and WebP images with JPEG or PNG fallbacks or even GIFs.                  |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=316.36) | It really depends on your vibe.                                                                   |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=318.54) | To test if your fallback images are working as expected, you can then open the rendering          |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=322.96) | tab, select disable AVIF image format or disable WebP image formats and refresh the page.         |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=329.9)  | So then the current image source, current source is now the fallback WebP image if you're         |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=336.0)  | disabling AVIF usually, which then you can test by hovering over the images and seeing            |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=340.44) | what the image source is.                                                                         |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=342.54) | So you don't have to necessarily open up a browser that you know is missing this image            |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=347.56) | format to test it.                                                                                |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=349.06) | You can test it just directly as you're doing the rest of your testing.                           |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=353.04) | I would still suggest cross browser testing for other things.                                     |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=356.02) | This is one other way, like while you're building, while you're creating your image strategy      |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=360.16) | to make sure and sanity check that your users are getting those images if you're using more       |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=365.38) | experimental formats.                                                                             |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=366.38) | Yeah, especially when I have like several image size and then several image format and            |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=372.72) | this is really handy for me to check it just with DevTools.                                       |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=376.62) | And AVIF is really crazy.                                                                         |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=378.38) | Like we were doing compression with it and it was like 90% plus for most of our images            |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=382.98) | for DesignSumber.                                                                                 |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=383.98) | Whoa.                                                                                             |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=384.98) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=385.98) | Apart from that, the animations tab lets you control and manipulate CSS animations and            |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=390.42) | visualize how everything works under the hood.                                                    |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=393.74) | To access the panel, press on Escape key to pull out the drawer, click on the three dot           |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=399.36) | menu and select animations.                                                                       |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=402.42) | Says your page has a loading animation and a scrolling animation when the user scrolls            |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=407.94) | down.                                                                                             |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=409.22) | By default, Chrome DevTools will listen for animations to take place.                             |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=414.06) | Once they do, they'll be added to the overview pane.                                              |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=417.86) | You can hover on each animation on the list to preview the animation.                             |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=422.7)  | Or click on them to add it to the details pane for further modification.                          |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=428.06) | Here you can press the replay button to replay the animation.                                     |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=432.7)  | Not only that, you can slow down the animation replay with the animation speed buttons.           |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=438.5)  | The animation will be replayed in the viewport.                                                   |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=441.7)  | Even better, you can modify the animation.                                                        |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=445.38) | For example, you can change the duration of an animation by clicking and dragging the             |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=450.66) | first or last circle.                                                                             |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=452.7)  | You can change the keyframe timing and start time delay too using a similar way.                  |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=457.78) | I use this animations panel all the time.                                                         |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=460.94) | Just the other day, I made one go really slow because it was too fast and it's awesome.           |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=467.1)  | It's almost like you can control time, like the sands of time.                                    |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=469.74) | You're just like, ha ha, go at 10% speed and it's just like things are crawling and you           |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=474.86) | feel like a superhero.                                                                            |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=476.5)  | Or another time where I had an animation where it's like four seconds long and I played the       |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=481.46) | animation and then I hit the pause button in the animations panel.                                |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=485.86) | From there, I could go back to the elements panel and do all sorts of style modifications         |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=489.7)  | and double check and make sure that the layout was good.                                          |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=492.34) | Then go back to the animations and hit play and it finishes the animation.                        |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=496.4)  | It's a really, really cool feature.                                                               |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=497.9)  | Yeah, I also do that.                                                                             |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=500.34) | I pause in a certain animation point and then take a screenshot.                                  |

| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=567.98) | It's kind of fun.                                                                                 |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=568.98) | True.                                                                                             |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=569.98) | I should have probably brought this up earlier, but did you know that you can actually emulate    |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=572.14) | those interactions that we talked about, like the hover states, through the command palette?      |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=576.14) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                         |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=577.14) | You can do it with emulate a focused page.                                                        |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=580.12) | That's an option that you can run through the command palette.                                    |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=583.94) | If you wanted to open up the DevTools command palette, it's Command Shift P, which is probably    |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=587.14) | similar to your text editor.                                                                      |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=589.3)  | I love this as a shortcut for anything.                                                           |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=591.32) | You could type dark and it'll open up dark mode emulation options just immediately.               |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=594.42) | You don't have to go searching for it in the tabs.                                                |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=597.38) | If you hit Command Shift P and type focus, emulate a focused page should pop up for you           |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=602.2)  | to run.                                                                                           |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=603.2)  | Again, why would you use this?                                                                    |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=605.58) | Say you have an interaction that you want to debug, like a search dropdown, and you               |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=609.14) | need it to be in a focused state.                                                                 |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=611.22) | You could right click it, go into DevTools, find the state, turn that on, but that can            |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=616.1)  | also be annoying when you want to debug the dropdown.                                             |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=619.1)  | So instead you can run it through the command palette, do set emulate a focused page, run         |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=623.64) | that, and then it'll automatically be focused.                                                    |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=626.2)  | You can open it in DevTools and you can debug it from there.                                      |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=629.42) | So just a little bit of a shortcut improvement when you are doing some of that debugging          |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=635.74) | of interaction states.                                                                            |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=637.52) | Nice one.                                                                                         |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=638.52) | The other day I was talking to my friend and then we talked about the census tab and they         |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=643.46) | are saying that, oh, DevTools have this census tab.                                               |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=646.68) | So today I want to share about the two lesser known emulate features in the census tab.           |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=652.36) | The first one is simulating the device orientation.                                               |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=656.04) | The device orientation event detects which side of the device is up and how the device            |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=661.42) | is rotating.                                                                                      |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=662.42) | For example, open a page with a paradox effect when device orientation changes.                   |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=668.92) | Select custom orientation in the census tab.                                                      |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=671.98) | You'll see a device showing up next to it.                                                        |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=675.12) | Drag it and rotate it up, down, left, right, and see how your parallax animation is moving        |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=681.36) | life.                                                                                             |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=682.36) | So cool.                                                                                          |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=683.36) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=684.36) | Another interesting feature is emulating inactive users.                                          |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=687.3)  | You can detect inactive users with the idle detection API.                                        |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=691.92) | For example, imagine you are developing a web application for a food ordering kiosk.              |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=697.94) | The kiosk will display a carousel of promotion when the screen is idle.                           |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=703.16) | When the customer click on the screen to wake it up, we redirect them to the menu page for        |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=708.52) | ordering.                                                                                         |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=710.04) | In the census tab, use the emulate idle detector state to emulate the combination of user active  |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=716.72) | and screen lock state.                                                                            |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=718.54) | This way you can debug the interaction easily without actually lock and unlocking your device     |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=724.32) | screen.                                                                                           |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=725.32) | Cool.                                                                                             |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=726.32) | I need to actually test that if you had to lock your device screen.                               |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=729.12) | That would be hard.                                                                               |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=731.32) | I didn't even know about this.                                                                    |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=732.56) | I didn't know about the sensors tab at all.                                                       |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=735.12) | This is news to me.                                                                               |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=736.72) | I've used it for a couple of demos.                                                               |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=738.68) | It's really neat and it makes for a cool video.                                                   |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=741.64) | Like if you just capture yourself using it because it is.                                         |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=745.2)  | It's like you get this whole simulated emulated device accelerometer experience all built         |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=750.84) | into the DevTools.                                                                                |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=751.84) | Wow.                                                                                              |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6UAQcFJFc7ViNKlQe4wP0r?&t=752.84) | That's really cool.                                                                               |
