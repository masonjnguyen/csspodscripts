| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.              |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=16.84)   | Today we're talking about pseudo-elements.                                                            |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=19.48)   | Pseudo-elements, yeah, these are abstract visual interface elements and decorations                   |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=24.96)   | that have no HTML or DOM to represent them.                                                           |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=27.56)   | They're like a ghost, they can be seen but not touched.                                               |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=30.28)   | And that's kind of how a pseudo-element exists in a page.                                             |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=33.22)   | Now we have dev tools, which have made these elusive elements findable.                               |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=36.64)   | Thank you dev tools.                                                                                  |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=37.64)   | But a pseudo-element should have two colons in front of it.                                           |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=40.38)   | And that's how you can distinguish it from a pseudo-class.                                            |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=43.16)   | They're not only great for keeping HTML clean from decorative elements like those little              |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=47.36)   | triangles on tool tips, but they're also great for targeting text and customizing selection           |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=52.0)    | highlights.                                                                                           |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=53.16)   | And lastly, in the web component world, pseudo-elements are the interface for targeting shadow nodes, |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=58.8)    | allowing for encapsulation and customization simultaneously.                                          |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=63.16)   | So when we're talking about pseudo-elements, some of the most common ones are after and               |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=67.44)   | before.                                                                                               |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=68.48)   | And so let's just dive into those.                                                                    |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=70.92)   | I'm going to start with the after pseudo-element.                                                     |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=73.56)   | After which is colon colon after, accesses a pseudo-element that is the last child of                 |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=78.48)   | the element on which it is applied.                                                                   |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=80.9)    | To create the pseudo-element, you must fill it with content using the content property.               |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=85.44)   | So you can inject any string here or you can have an empty string just to allow for this              |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=89.36)   | element to appear on the page.                                                                        |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=91.76)   | Pseudo-elements are usually decorative, but adding content in there will be read by most              |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=95.84)   | modern screen readers as well.                                                                        |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=97.9)    | So keep that in mind when you are adding content to your pseudo-elements.                             |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=102.18)  | Pseudo-elements cannot be added to replace elements though, like image and video, because             |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=106.48)  | they're contained by the parents formatting box.                                                      |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=109.08)  | So if you're trying to add a pseudo-element like an after to an image and it's not working,           |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=113.04)  | this is why you got to add it to an element that has a formatting box, which is most elements         |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=119.16)  | just not replaced ones.                                                                               |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=120.48)  | Yeah, wrap it in a div.                                                                               |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=121.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=122.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=123.48)  | Cool.                                                                                                 |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=124.48)  | And then we have before, which allows either the selection of the before pseudo-element.              |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=128.04)  | So if you don't put content in that set of rules, you can select the existing one and                 |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=132.3)   | style it, or you can create a new one by passing in some new content and then styling it as           |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=136.56)  | well.                                                                                                 |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=137.56)  | The before one will show up as the first child in the list of elements and where after will           |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=142.2)   | be at the end of something.                                                                           |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=143.84)  | So it's just kind of interesting that we have before and after.                                       |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=146.44)  | They're really nice for placing things inside of there.                                               |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=148.7)   | If you omit the content property, you can select and modify an existing pseudo-element.               |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=152.86)  | So that's kind of nice in case you have another class and style set that's kind of outlining          |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=157.02)  | the majority of the pseudo-element.                                                                   |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=159.38)  | You can then finish it with some other selectors that sort of finalize it out.                        |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=162.8)   | I have this happen all the time with like, I'll do before and after, have position absolute           |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=166.12)  | and have these like styles on them, and then I'll say, okay, now just this before, it's               |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=169.88)  | on the right, and then the other after is on the left or something like that.                         |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=173.28)  | So it's kind of cool.                                                                                 |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=174.28)  | It's also worth noting that you can use Flexbox Grid and absolute positioning on these created        |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=178.48)  | elements.                                                                                             |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=179.48)  | It's super handy.                                                                                     |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=180.48)  | So you can use Flexbox on a before to perfectly center a vertical icon inside of a circle.            |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=185.02)  | It's super, super rad.                                                                                |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=186.24)  | Yes, and if you do use absolute positioning for the pseudo-elements, which I do all the               |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=189.76)  | time, make sure that you have a position relative on the parent so that it's positioned within        |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=194.0)   | that scope.                                                                                           |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=195.0)   | Otherwise, it's going to be like at the top of the document, and you're going to forget               |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=197.36)  | about it and be like, where is this?                                                                  |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=200.92)  | So the next pseudo-element that we're going to talk about is first letter, which selects              |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=204.18)  | the first letter in a block level element.                                                            |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=206.94)  | So for example, if you have a paragraph, p colon colon first letter will target the first             |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=212.28)  | letter in that paragraph.                                                                             |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=213.84)  | So if you have like lorem ipsum, that would be the L in the lorem ipsum text.                         |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=218.78)  | And this makes it possible to style drop caps, which is that stylized first letter for a              |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=223.28)  | set of texts.                                                                                         |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=224.28)  | It's really popular in historical texts without needing to wrap the first letter in span elements,    |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=229.96)  | which would then cause obfuscation in the HTML.                                                       |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=233.36)  | We don't need that with first letter.                                                                 |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=235.24)  | It's important to note that you can't just supply any CSS to first letter.                            |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=239.32)  | There is a concrete set of allowable styles for this, which include all the font properties,          |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=244.44)  | color, all the background properties, all spacing properties like padding and margin,                 |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=249.4)   | all border properties, and some of the text properties like text decoration, alignment,               |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=254.04)  | and shadows.                                                                                          |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=255.04)  | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=256.04)  | You'll notice that a lot of these pseudo elements that they only allow a certain set of styles        |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=259.0)   | to come in, which I think is fine.                                                                    |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=260.96)  | And we'll study those as we go through.                                                               |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=262.96)  | There's also colon colon first line.                                                                  |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=265.16)  | So again, just like where the paragraph could target the first letter in its content.                 |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=269.0)   | So it's kind of worth noting to that that paragraph content must be just a string of                  |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=273.08)  | content.                                                                                              |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=274.08)  | You can't have other nodes in there.                                                                  |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=275.52)  | Same thing with first line, because what first line will do is literally the first line in            |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=278.84)  | the paragraph, you can style it.                                                                      |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=280.98)  | So let's say the line keeps going and it wraps onto a new line.                                       |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=284.0)   | The second line won't be styled where the first one was.                                              |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=287.2)   | It's super cool.                                                                                      |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=288.48)  | Now there's a couple of caveats to this.                                                              |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=290.32)  | The display of the element that's being first line selected must be set to block inline               |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=294.88)  | block table caption or table cell.                                                                    |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=297.44)  | You can't use this on grid or flexbox.                                                                |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=300.14)  | It's literally the first line of text before any wrapping has occurred.                               |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=303.58)  | And so flexbox creates children, grid create children, whereas display block doesn't create           |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=308.68)  | child items.                                                                                          |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=309.68)  | So you have access to that content.                                                                   |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=311.92)  | And then just like with the first letter, you can't use all CSS properties on the selector.           |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=315.72)  | It's mostly like font and background changes.                                                         |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=317.84)  | We also have backdrop, which is colon colon backdrop.                                                 |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=321.0)   | And this appears when an element is being presented in full screen mode, such as a video              |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=325.82)  | or modal being placed using the full screen API.                                                      |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=328.44)  | I actually didn't know about the pseudo element until we were looking into researching for            |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=332.28)  | the show.                                                                                             |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=333.28)  | But with backdrop, you can style the plane between the full screen element and the background.        |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=337.88)  | So you can control that color if you wanted whenever a video was in full screen mode,                 |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=341.72)  | the background to be yellow, that space between like the top and bottom, if it was a wide             |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=346.28)  | video, that's when you use backdrop.                                                                  |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=349.46)  | You can even use partially transparent colors to let the background show through a little             |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=353.64)  | bit.                                                                                                  |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=354.64)  | But you would be styling this like video colon colon backdrop.                                        |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=357.56)  | And then within that you could start like backgrounds, background color mostly.                       |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=361.36)  | And this is actually currently supported in all modern browsers except for Safari.                    |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=365.32)  | So yeah, I was just surprised to hear about this one.                                                 |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=367.68)  | Super red.                                                                                            |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=369.04)  | That's awesome.                                                                                       |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=370.04)  | So you could do video colon colon backdrop and inside of there do a backdrop filter.                  |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=374.48)  | Well that is supported in Safari and not in the other modern browsers.                                |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=377.44)  | So that's a bit of a rabbit hole.                                                                     |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=381.28)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=382.28)  | Anyway, it's kind of fun.                                                                             |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=383.28)  | You got backdrop, pseudo selector with a backdrop filter.                                             |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=386.46)  | And that's just cool.                                                                                 |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=387.6)   | The next one we have here is colon colon marker.                                                      |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=390.22)  | So this one selects the bullet in like a bulleted list, for example, or the number in an ordered      |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=394.84)  | list.                                                                                                 |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=395.84)  | It's also for that neat arrow thingy that you get in a summary element, the one that                  |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=399.76)  | twists up and down.                                                                                   |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=401.34)  | So you can style these with the colon colon marker selector.                                          |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=404.84)  | It's for font properties, colors, and other few small things that are allowed for styling.            |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=408.74)  | So similar to the ones above.                                                                         |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=410.4)   | And the support right now is behind web experiments and Chromium.                                     |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=413.58)  | It's supported in Firefox, but it's missing from Opera and Safari.                                    |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=416.8)   | And I talked to the Chromium engineers and we're going to have it this year because Agalia            |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=420.36)  | is working on it.                                                                                     |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=421.36)  | Yay!                                                                                                  |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=422.36)  | So marker will come to Chromium.                                                                      |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=423.36)  | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=424.36)  | So I love selection and I love selection because back in design school, there was a student           |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=429.0)   | in my class who would say that her work wasn't finished without adding a colon colon selection        |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=433.68)  | style.                                                                                                |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=434.68)  | And I've sort of adopted that mentality ever since because it's just such a nice touch,               |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=438.96)  | right?                                                                                                |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=439.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=440.96)  | So selection allows you to style highlighted text.                                                    |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=443.02)  | So you most commonly would be changing the background color and the color of the text.                |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=447.06)  | And you can apply this to the entire document with just colon colon selection and then an             |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=452.28)  | open curly brace, close curly brace, then that apply to styling, omitting the leading                 |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=456.4)   | element entirely.                                                                                     |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=457.68)  | Or you can apply it to a specific element, like a header with H1 colon colon selection,               |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=463.0)   | and then the styles there.                                                                            |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=464.6)   | This would only apply styles when you're selecting the H1s.                                           |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=469.4)   | So I've actually seen a lot of like funny selection Easter eggs with fixed positioning                |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=473.5)   | images that appear when you select a paragraph of text, like a velociraptor would appear.             |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=478.2)   | I don't remember when or like where to find this now, but I clearly remember this like                |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=481.76)  | moment in web history in my head.                                                                     |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=484.28)  | I remember velociraptor.js.                                                                           |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=486.28)  | There was like a tool that that's all it did would bring in a raptor.                                 |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=489.4)   | It's like jQuery days.                                                                                |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=491.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=492.16)  | You know, I miss like Konami code.                                                                    |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=493.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |

| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=499.12)  | Back when we were fun and now we're all business.                                                     |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=501.0)   | We're making apps now.                                                                                |

| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=503.64)  | Well there's still fun stuff on the web.                                                              |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=505.0)   | Oh totally.                                                                                           |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=506.0)   | I agree.                                                                                              |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=507.0)   | But where there is selection, there's also inactive selection.                                        |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=510.12)  | This isn't currently implemented in all browsers, but it is an active discussion with the CSS         |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=514.28)  | working group.                                                                                        |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=515.28)  | And what colon colon inactive selection does is it styles a selected or the highlighted               |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=520.24)  | text on a page when the window is not in focus.                                                       |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=523.6)   | So if you have highlighted text and then you tab over to another window, this would be                |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=527.64)  | the style applied.                                                                                    |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=529.26)  | So this doesn't currently work, but it had worked in the past with a colon colon selection            |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=533.76)  | and then colon window inactive, the window inactive pseudo class, which we'll talk about              |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=538.08)  | in our next episode, but it worked in the past in like 2009 and apparently since 2018                 |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=543.28)  | it stopped working and now there's talks of bringing it back.                                         |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=546.52)  | So that's fun fact.                                                                                   |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=548.68)  | That's interesting.                                                                                   |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=549.68)  | So that's like you highlight text and then click in another window and it turns to like               |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=552.68)  | a light gray because it's still selected, but it's inactive.                                          |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=556.0)   | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=557.0)   | So the example I saw was the highlighted text was hot pink and then when you went to another          |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=561.12)  | window that would turn like a light pink.                                                             |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=562.52)  | So you knew it was still selected, but it wasn't currently in focus.                                  |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=565.52)  | What a cool little micro interaction to be able to control CSS.                                       |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=569.28)  | I'm a fan.                                                                                            |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=570.28)  | All right.                                                                                            |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=571.28)  | Well, you will also have some related to text is we have spelling error and grammar error.            |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=575.92)  | So this is colon colon spelling dash error, colon colon grammar dash error.                           |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=579.92)  | And this lets you customize a portion of text that was flagged by the user agent as miss              |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=583.68)  | spelled.                                                                                              |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=584.68)  | So the browser is in control of what's misspelled, but this lets you tie into the styling there.      |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=589.64)  | It does though require that the element that you're writing these pseudo elements for.                |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=594.16)  | The spelling error selector needs to be a content editable div.                                       |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=598.36)  | So you have to have the content editable attribute.                                                   |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=600.46)  | And so with that you can then check for spelling error and grammar error and style them.              |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=603.76)  | Super cool.                                                                                           |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=604.76)  | It comes with a neat new property will value really called spelling error.                            |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=608.2)   | So you can say text decoration line colon spelling dash error.                                        |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=611.88)  | So that's the little squiggly we see.                                                                 |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=614.16)  | And then for grammar error, it's pretty much the same style and story where you get this              |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=617.96)  | new text decoration line property and you can pass in grammar error.                                  |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=622.16)  | That is so cool.                                                                                      |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=623.64)  | Now none of these are supported yet, but I do like where it's headed.                                 |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=626.32)  | It's cool.                                                                                            |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=627.32)  | I love that.                                                                                          |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=628.32)  | I didn't even know about these and they just seem like it makes authoring on the web so               |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=634.0)   | much better.                                                                                          |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=635.0)   | It's really cool.                                                                                     |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=636.0)   | Like I feel like the web is making it easier to style content like Photoshop on the web.              |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=640.8)   | Like this is sort of a text editor on the web.                                                        |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=643.24)  | Anyway, there's just so many cool things you can do with CSS now.                                     |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=645.96)  | It's very open, right?                                                                                |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=646.96)  | It's like transparent.                                                                                |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=647.96)  | They're like here you can change it now.                                                              |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=648.96)  | It doesn't always have to be a red wave.                                                              |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=650.84)  | You know, you can make a pink double wave or something.                                               |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=653.12)  | Yeah, totally to fit a style.                                                                         |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=655.0)   | And you know, a lot of authoring apps exist, blog apps out there like Medium.                         |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=659.84)  | And it just makes a lot of sense to have this, I think.                                               |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=662.44)  | Yeah, we do a lot of text editing in forms.                                                           |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=664.8)   | So yeah, this is cool.                                                                                |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=665.8)   | Yeah, or even just forms.                                                                             |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=667.76)  | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=668.76)  | So the next one I want to talk about is form related.                                                 |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=672.12)  | And this is colon colon placeholder.                                                                  |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=674.76)  | Placeholder refers to the styling of placeholder text in inputs or text areas.                        |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=679.24)  | And this is the text that is written usually with more of a faded appearance in a field               |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=684.2)   | to give you either a prompt or an idea of what to write there.                                        |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=688.16)  | So it sort of visually functions as a label, but it's not a label.                                    |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=692.36)  | An example would be if you had a search bar and you would have like search in that search             |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=696.5)   | bar.                                                                                                  |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=697.5)   | Or if you had a login form, it might say username and password in the two form fields that are        |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=704.64)  | for username and password.                                                                            |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=706.24)  | Now again, this is not a label.                                                                       |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=707.66)  | You can have both a label and a placeholder text.                                                     |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=711.08)  | So it's individually styleable from the label.                                                        |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=713.92)  | But if you did want to style the placeholder, you would write like input colon colon placeholder,     |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=720.08)  | and then you'd be able to apply styles to this piece of text, whether that be color                   |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=723.92)  | or typography properties.                                                                             |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=726.54)  | The world is your oyster.                                                                             |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=727.54)  | Yeah, good call.                                                                                      |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=728.54)  | It's kind of like a hint instead of a label because it might disappear as soon as the                 |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=731.7)   | value shows up.                                                                                       |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=733.04)  | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=734.04)  | The last on our list here is colon colon Q that's C U E colon colon C U E.                            |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=738.84)  | And this is a way for you to style captions in a video element.                                       |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=742.44)  | You can style the captions.                                                                           |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=743.86)  | The caption element is the queue and you can select it with this element selector, colon              |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=748.56)  | colon Q. It's a functional selector though, so it can take a selector inside of it.                   |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=753.04)  | So it would be colon colon Q parentheses and you can pass a selector and parentheses.                 |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=757.78)  | And this allows the styling of the nested rich HTML that can be passed as part of a                   |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=761.8)   | web video caption.                                                                                    |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=763.42)  | So like italics or bolded statements, you can basically put markdown in a video caption               |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=768.16)  | and the queue element accepts this functional selector style and you can go find all those            |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=772.8)   | nested little cool HTML things you did and style them.                                                |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=775.72)  | That's awesome.                                                                                       |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=776.72)  | It's just so rad.                                                                                     |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=777.72)  | So anyway, the captions on the web can be very customized and uniquely made and tailored              |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=782.08)  | for an experience.                                                                                    |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=783.08)  | I love it.                                                                                            |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=784.08)  | Do you know what the support of this is?                                                              |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=785.08)  | The support is pretty good for Q colon colon Q. The support is really good.                           |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=789.08)  | There's other Q pseudo elements and pseudo selectors that aren't supported as well.                   |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=794.04)  | So there's like Q region and a few others.                                                            |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=795.84)  | I think, yeah, I talk about it here in a couple of bullets, but the queue selector itself             |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=800.68)  | is really good.                                                                                       |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=801.68)  | And what's kind of cool too about it is you can just do colon colon Q and open up a style             |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=805.24)  | block just like selection.                                                                            |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=806.4)   | So you can put these essentially at the root and style all the queues or you could target             |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=810.84)  | a queue specifically for, you know, based on class name.                                              |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=813.48)  | It's just really cool.                                                                                |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=814.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=815.48)  | So Q, how rich are you?                                                                               |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=816.48)  | You're super rich.                                                                                    |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=817.48)  | I like it.                                                                                            |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=818.48)  | I love just discovering new parts of CSS that I hadn't thought about before.                          |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=823.16)  | Like styling the captions in a video.                                                                 |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=826.12)  | What?                                                                                                 |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=827.12)  | You can have a CSS.                                                                                   |

| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=834.36)  | because there are a couple of pseudo elements that correspond to web components and the               |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=838.32)  | shadow DOM.                                                                                           |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=839.92)  | And this allows for styling of those custom elements that you can't normally get because              |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=848.32)  | they exist in the shadow DOM world.                                                                   |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=851.12)  | So currently the only way to do this sort of styling of web components is through CSS                 |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=857.56)  | custom properties at the root of that elements and then allow those to trickle down into              |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=861.36)  | the custom properties shadow DOM.                                                                     |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=863.28)  | So custom properties are sort of the only interface for CSS right now with web components,            |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=869.64)  | which isn't great because sort of like a blunt hammer as a tool, but there is a solution              |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=874.92)  | that's brewing with part and theme, which work in unison.                                             |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=878.48)  | So part, which looks like colon colon part is a pseudo element.                                       |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=882.08)  | The part CSS pseudo element represents any element within a shadow tree that has a matching           |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=887.18)  | part attribute.                                                                                       |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=888.18)  | So you can think of this like a fancy class tag.                                                      |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=891.28)  | So in the shadow DOM, when you're writing a web component, the part must be added to                  |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=895.36)  | the child to identify it as styleable, making it accessible outside of the shadow root.               |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=901.12)  | So if you had a tab within a tab group web component, you could have a div part equals                |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=907.48)  | tab active.                                                                                           |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=908.48)  | So this has parts tab and part active, and then you would call it tab one and then close              |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=913.4)   | that.                                                                                                 |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=914.4)   | So then to style it with CSS, you could do the tab component, which is the name of the                |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=920.04)  | web component, colon colon part, and then maybe active inside there.                                  |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=924.06)  | So you're styling the active part and then give that like a background yellow to specify              |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=927.98)  | that the active tab is yellow.                                                                        |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=930.32)  | When you have nested elements within web components, however, you need to forward parts in order      |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=934.88)  | for them to be accessible to the user for styling.                                                    |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=937.84)  | And this actually gets a lot more nuanced.                                                            |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=939.84)  | There's a great post from Monica that we put in the show notes that goes into part and                |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=947.2)   | theme a little bit more and how to forward them the specific forwarding syntax.                       |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=952.56)  | But we'll have to save that for another show because it's pretty nuanced and it's also                |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=956.4)   | sort of shifting.                                                                                     |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=957.76)  | So part solves the issue with styling individually tagged elements.                                   |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=962.38)  | But what about if you want to style things more broadly, say all of the links within                  |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=966.94)  | a custom element?                                                                                     |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=968.56)  | Either the author can forward all of these parts properly, which is pretty verbose for                |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=972.08)  | the author, or the user would have to write a pretty verbose CSS statement.                           |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=976.04)  | And that's where colon colon theme comes in.                                                          |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=978.44)  | Do do do do.                                                                                          |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=979.44)  | Yeah, do do do do.                                                                                    |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=981.04)  | Theme is still an ongoing discussion, so part is more stable at this time, so that's important        |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=984.88)  | to note.                                                                                              |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=985.88)  | But what theme would allow is even if you hadn't forwarded all of the parts, you could                |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=989.8)   | still style all of the custom shadow elements within a parent web component.                          |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=994.32)  | So if you had the tab component colon colon theme tab element, or you could apply this                |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=998.8)   | at the root so you can do colon root colon colon theme tab element.                                   |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1002.4)  | This lets you style all the tab element parts within the app without specifying all of the            |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1007.76) | forwarding.                                                                                           |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1008.76) | So I hope that this made a little bit of sense and was a little insight into web components           |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1012.8)  | and what's sort of coming down the pipeline for predefined parts of a web component.                  |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1017.84) | But Adam, what happens when there are arbitrary or user added content within these web components?    |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1023.32) | Right, the web component can't control everything, so it needs a way for you to pass it your          |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1028.1)  | kind of custom markup that wants to, you know, live inside of that shadow DOM and gain all            |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1033.2)  | the properties that that component has, but take something kind of dynamic and not necessarily        |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1037.44) | own everything.                                                                                       |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1038.62) | So that's where slots come in.                                                                        |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1040.1)  | So this had a previous name called colon colon content, but now it's called colon colon               |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1043.94) | slotted.                                                                                              |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1045.22) | And the selector syntax here is colon colon slotted, open parentheses, and then you can               |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1049.2)  | pass a compound selector list inside of there and then close the parentheses.                         |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1053.16) | So it's another functional pseudo element like Q. And what it's trying to do here is                  |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1057.04) | target adopted slot elements in a shadow DOM.                                                         |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1060.52) | So that's the most succinct way I could say it.                                                       |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1062.08) | But let me break that down a little bit more.                                                         |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1063.52) | So custom DOM placed into slots by a component user.                                                  |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1067.48) | So me as like a consumer of someone else's web component, I can place custom DOM inside               |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1073.8)  | of this custom element and give them a couple of names and those key names will let the               |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1078.12) | custom element bring in those children that I passed in and place them into the appropriate           |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1083.56) | area inside of the shadow DOM.                                                                        |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1085.36) | So these are slotted elements.                                                                        |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1087.16) | They were inserted into a slot and they were adopted by the shadow DOM.                               |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1090.6)  | And now from the outside, I can target these particular elements very specifically using              |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1095.64) | the slotted pseudo element selector.                                                                  |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1098.5)  | And so it's super cool.                                                                               |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1099.6)  | It works also with things like before and after.                                                      |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1102.12) | And I find that like slotted in this whole grand scheme of custom elements and exporting              |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1106.76) | their styles and their parts.                                                                         |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1108.64) | This is like the finishing touch here.                                                                |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1110.28) | So the first part that you know went over is the author of the web component says, here's             |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1114.64) | my parts, and here's my themable items.                                                               |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1117.8)  | So these are like exports from your module, you're being very explicit about what you're              |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1121.4)  | willing to accept.                                                                                    |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1122.68) | And then the slots are the same thing you say, hey, I have slots where you can put in                 |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1126.7)  | content and I will wrap it and make it dynamic and have some cool behavior.                           |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1130.68) | Here's the name of the slot.                                                                          |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1131.92) | And the user of that says, all right, well, cool, I've got this rad web component does                |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1134.92) | XYZ, it needs me to put elements into this slot.                                                      |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1138.24) | And I'm going to target them and style them with this theme.                                          |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1140.88) | And then I'm going to reference some of their parts and do some customization there in a              |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1143.6)  | more granular level.                                                                                  |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1144.96) | And that's how these web components are trying to open up this, you know, encapsulated element,       |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1149.78) | but give it the ability to be customized.                                                             |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1152.14) | And I think this is kind of a cool little setup they've got here.                                     |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1154.6)  | It's working really nice.                                                                             |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1woLO9AzhL7AttbCsaL1o7?&t=1155.6)  | Well, that's it for pseudo elements.                                                                  |
