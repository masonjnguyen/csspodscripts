| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=17.6)   | And today we answer the question, why won't this CSS property work?                                |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=21.88)  | Or where is this style coming from?                                                                |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=23.84)  | I never wrote it into my code.                                                                     |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=25.8)   | I have definitely asked these questions.                                                           |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=28.04)  | And in the web and on our web pages, this is usually solved through writing CSS rules              |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=32.4)   | with the specificity of the selector in mind.                                                      |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=35.74)  | But what happens when you have multiple rules with the same specificity acting on your element?    |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=41.28)  | When specificity isn't the answer, it might be the cascade of styles from user agents              |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=46.0)   | to local user styles that help resolve this.                                                       |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=48.72)  | Each rule in any CSS that ever gets declared enters the cascade, but only one will win.            |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=54.76)  | The cascade is really important because it is the C in CSS for cascading style sheets.             |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=64.04)  | And so at a basic level, it's important to note that style sheets cascade.                         |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=68.62)  | And what this basically means is that location and order matter when you're writing style          |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=72.68)  | rules.                                                                                             |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=73.94)  | When two rules apply that have equal specificity within the same style sheet, the one that         |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=78.48)  | comes last on the page is the one that will be used.                                               |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=81.68)  | But this not only impacts styles within the same style sheet, it also impacts styles from          |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=86.48)  | various style sheets.                                                                              |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=87.84)  | And that's where it gets interesting.                                                              |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=89.72)  | CSS is written and called from multiple sources, some beyond your control as a web author,         |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=95.52)  | such as those that may come from the browser, a.k.a. user agent styles, or user-specified          |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=100.72) | styles which override your author code locally.                                                    |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=103.72) | A user might write local styles for accessibility, for example.                                    |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=107.34) | The order of import or declaration comes into play here regarding specificity at the cascade       |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=112.44) | level.                                                                                             |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=113.44) | The cascade itself is made up of four phases, position, specificity, origin, and importance.       |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=120.18) | We talked about specificity in our last show, but let's break down the other three.                |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=124.28) | Adam, do you want to start with origin?                                                            |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=126.04) | I do.                                                                                              |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=127.04) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=128.04) | So origins, which is a funny word that recently came up from Miriam Suzanne, who has this          |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=131.72) | cool proposal about it, got me thinking about it.                                                  |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=134.34) | And now we're about to tell you about it.                                                          |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=136.2)  | And what origins are, it's the browser needs to look at where all the rules are coming             |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=140.16) | from and it scores each of these.                                                                  |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=142.64) | Like your website.                                                                                 |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=143.94) | So this is the part where you own it as the author of a website.                                   |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=147.24) | You have first party CSS that might be coming in through a link tag, and first party meaning       |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=151.52) | like you authored it and it's bundled up and you're importing it through a link tag.               |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=155.44) | You might have third party CSS coming in.                                                          |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=157.6)  | So this is a different origin, but it's still coming in through the same mechanism through         |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=161.28) | a link tag.                                                                                        |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=162.28) | You might have embedded style sheets in your HTML and you might have inline styles.                |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=166.84) | So these are the origins that come from you as the author.                                         |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=169.96) | You are usually the one putting these things there and these are styles that want to change        |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=173.28) | the page.                                                                                          |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=174.28) | But you also have more.                                                                            |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=175.84) | There's two other origins that people don't tend to think about.                                   |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=178.92) | And one of them is your browser.                                                                   |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=180.68) | And this is one actually maybe people do think about because it's your user agent styles.          |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=184.48) | We'll talk about these I'm sure in another episode.                                                |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=186.8)  | And these are things where the browser that you're using has set some default styles for           |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=190.48) | all of the elements on the page.                                                                   |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=192.16) | And that's an origin.                                                                              |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=193.52) | And another origin is your user.                                                                   |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=195.94) | It's their client.                                                                                 |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=197.08) | It's the options that they've either set at the platform level or that they're setting             |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=200.9)  | in their browser.                                                                                  |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=201.9)  | This could be things like font size or maybe they're on mobile.                                    |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=204.28) | Maybe the mobile client has some styles that it comes by default to help the mobile experience     |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=208.42) | be better.                                                                                         |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=209.42) | And I feel like a lot of this stuff makes sense too, that you have to look at the origin           |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=213.32) | of these different styles in order to really order them and think about their importance.          |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=217.76) | So I like to think of styles in a link tag.                                                        |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=220.7)  | They feel prominent, right?                                                                        |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=222.32) | I put a style here and I'm linking to it, but it's not dominant.                                   |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=226.26) | It's still sort of distant away from the HTML.                                                     |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=229.4)  | Whereas you have styles that are embedded in a style tag in the HTML, they live closer             |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=233.4)  | to the markup.                                                                                     |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=234.56) | And it sort of like feels more specific to me.                                                     |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=236.68) | So I think origins make sense in a lot of ways here.                                               |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=239.0)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=240.0)  | And an interesting tidbit also is that when you have important rules in your authored              |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=245.08) | code, those would actually get overwritten by the user agent's important rules.                    |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=251.08) | So you would think it's the opposite way around where you as an author have the most control       |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=254.68) | or even a local user would have most control.                                                      |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=257.06) | But if you can envision this diagram of cascade origin specificity, if we start from least         |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=262.46) | to most specific, the least specific styles are the user agent's base styles.                      |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=268.14) | Then when we are increasing in specificity, you have your local user styles.                       |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=273.16) | On top of that, we have the styles that you as a developer have authored.                          |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=277.24) | And then on top of that, that has even more specificity, is when your author styles have           |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=281.8)  | the important tag on them.                                                                         |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=284.36) | Now when a local user decides to use the important tag, that gets precedence over the author       |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=289.44) | important.                                                                                         |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=290.88) | And the item that gets the most specificity is the user agent's important tags.                    |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=296.84) | So it kind of goes base user agent styles, then base local user styles, then base author           |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=302.12) | styles, then it inverts and you have the author styles important, local user important, and        |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=307.84) | the user agent important tags from least to most specific.                                         |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=310.72) | Oh man, you nailed that.                                                                           |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=312.68) | And this is probably why people think the cascade is confusing is just for examples                |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=316.0)  | like this.                                                                                         |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=317.0)  | It also demonstrates the power that's coming from the browser.                                     |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=319.24) | But y'all should see this image that Una made.                                                     |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=321.24) | It's got her delightful art style just all over it.                                                |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=323.8)  | And we'll share it in the show notes.                                                              |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=325.14) | It's really, really nice.                                                                          |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=326.5)  | And if you're reading or listening and if you're reading about the cascade or you're               |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=329.64) | listening to us talk about the cascade and you're feeling confused, I think you should             |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=332.88) | see this image.                                                                                    |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=334.04) | It could really be the key to like unlock your understanding.                                      |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=336.4)  | You know, this image is so sick.                                                                   |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=338.46) | It might even be rad as you know, some nerd might call it.                                         |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=341.8)  | Well, I'm glad that you like it.                                                                   |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=344.16) | That was style origins and they play a part on the cascade.                                        |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=346.8)  | But let's talk about position you mentioned and where the styles are in the document.              |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=351.48) | You know, can you tell us about position?                                                          |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=352.96) | Yeah, position is really important also.                                                           |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=355.62) | As I mentioned earlier, the position in the same style sheet is going to have more specificity     |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=361.4)  | if it's the same level of specificity when it's further down the page than on the top              |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=366.08) | of the page.                                                                                       |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=367.08) | But this also matters for the document itself.                                                     |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=369.42) | So if you have something like a link containing a style sheet at the top, that is going to         |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=374.2)  | have less specificity than a link at the bottom, which is going to override that link on top.      |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=379.52) | Same thing with an injected style tag.                                                             |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=381.24) | This is an embedded style.                                                                         |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=382.62) | If you have embedded styles towards the top of the page and you have embedded styles towards       |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=386.36) | the bottom of the page, the embedded styles toward the bottom of the page will override            |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=390.6)  | the embedded styles towards the top of the page.                                                   |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=392.24) | Again, this is if the rest of the specificity is equal.                                            |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=395.48) | But if you have an embedded style tag in your HTML document at the bottom or even at the           |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=400.88) | top, it'll still override an imported style sheet no matter where it is on the page because        |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=405.76) | that will have more specificity than that imported style.                                          |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=410.2)  | And then the thing that has the most specificity of all of these is when you have styles in        |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=415.2)  | line on the subject itself, so on the note itself.                                                 |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=419.68) | Inline styles will typically always override other styles, including important statements          |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=424.76) | within your CSS.                                                                                   |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=425.76) | That's very nice.                                                                                  |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=426.76) | I've always kind of like wondered inline styles, why are they so important?                        |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=430.36) | And then when you think about, totally unintended pun.                                             |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=434.72) | Why are they so important?                                                                         |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=436.24) | But it's like until we were preparing for this, I mean, position is a type of specificity,         |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=440.52) | right?                                                                                             |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=441.52) | It's like it's a proximity to the elements almost physically in the code makes it more             |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=446.42) | important and that is really neat.                                                                 |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=448.0)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=449.0)  | Specificity is really such a big topic and I didn't even realize how big of a topic it             |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=453.0)  | was until we really started diving into not just specificity in terms of selectors, but            |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=458.0)  | also the cascade and also inheritance, which we'll talk about in our next episode.                 |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=462.36) | Totally agree.                                                                                     |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=463.36) | I mean, super strong agree.                                                                        |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=464.6)  | Okay, so that leaves us with importance.                                                           |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=467.64) | And this is the fourth of the phases and we're all pretty familiar with the important keyword      |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=472.72) | and it's phenomenal cosmic power, but itty bitty living space.                                     |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=476.76) | Do you want to say that again?                                                                     |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=479.52) | Phenomenal cosmic power.                                                                           |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=480.52) | Oh man, am I going to be one of those people that you can just invoke twice?                       |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=483.16) | I suppose.                                                                                         |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=484.16) | We need to use that soundbite somewhere.                                                           |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=486.44) | It needs to have the Aladdin gif with it.                                                          |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=489.24) | It turns out that not all rules are the same.                                                      |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=491.88) | Even if you don't specify important, okay, so like the browser will tag each rule as               |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=498.16) | it discovers them and it says, what type of rule are you?                                          |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=501.92) | So when we're talking about importance, what we're really talking about is what type of            |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=505.56) | rule is it?                                                                                        |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=506.56) | And it turns out there's four types of rules.                                                      |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=508.88) | So here's some fun knowledge from the spec coming in.                                              |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=511.76) | First, this is pretty much the common rule that you write all the time and this is a               |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=515.94) | normal rule and that's literally what it's called.                                                 |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=518.58) | It's a normal type.                                                                                |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=519.92) | And this would be why the concept of rule types is kind of foreign.                                |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=523.08) | It doesn't come up very often, but when you study the intricacies of the web styling,              |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=527.04) | it's a really nice datum to have in your back pocket that like normal rules are the least          |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=530.98) | specific.                                                                                          |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=532.28) | So the next more specific rule type is animations.                                                 |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=536.42) | They're more specific than normal rules and that's especially because when they're active,         |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=540.96) | so if the animation is active, it gets promoted in terms of specificity.                           |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=544.32) | And the browser and CSS spec teams, they assumed that if you created an animation, you very        |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=549.04) | much want to see it apply and work, right?                                                         |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=551.34) | You shouldn't have a specificity battle with your animation.                                       |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=554.68) | Next in terms of importance and types of rules is our friend and enemy, bang important.            |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=561.16) | So that's exclamation important.                                                                   |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=562.58) | We all know this one.                                                                              |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=563.76) | We've all used it to escape and we've all used it to attack and the rules with this                |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=567.46) | flag, so anytime they see a rule that has this flag, it's marked with very high importance.        |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=572.56) | And that's kind of why important is part of importance and how you can even outrule and            |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=578.2)  | outscore another important item.                                                                   |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=580.0)  | So it's kind of fun.                                                                               |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=581.08) | And the last thing, there's something more important than important and it's transitions.          |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=586.68) | So in the grand scheme of importance, transitions and especially an active transition is of        |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=591.68) | the utmost importance.                                                                             |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=593.56) | I thought that was super interesting.                                                              |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=595.38) | So the line of CSS you write inside of a declaration, you know, like font size one rem is a normal |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=601.04) | rule, but if you want it to become an abnormal rule, I'm just kidding.                             |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=605.1)  | It's not abnormal, but if you want to change your importance of your rule, you would author        |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=609.28) | font size one rem important.                                                                       |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=612.04) | And this instantly becomes a very important rule in the cascade arena.                             |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=615.94) | I find this super interesting because things like transitions, I hadn't really thought             |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=620.28) | about the specificity of those before, but it clearly makes sense.                                 |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=623.24) | And the authors who wrote CSS have really put a lot of thought into this.                          |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=626.72) | So it's been really cool to see this recap and thank you so much for going over that.              |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=631.66) | For all of you listening at home, to recap our whole episode, the cascade leverages not            |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=637.88) | one, not two, but four phases to organize, filter, and sort the rules and rule sets of             |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=643.36) | a document.                                                                                        |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=644.4)  | And those are position, specificity, origin, and importance.                                       |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=647.82) | There's four phases of the cascade, four types of importance rules, many position types,           |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=652.88) | and unlimited specificity combinations.                                                            |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/698XEvD2VUmg4iVZEZqL7I?&t=655.0)  | That was amazing recap.                                                                            |
