| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=35.88)  | I'm the developer advocate for Chrome DevTools.                                                     |

| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=46.44)  | Yuna and Adam.                                                                                      |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=48.2)   | We're excited to have you here.                                                                     |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=50.0)   | Yes.                                                                                                |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=51.0)   | So let's get into color, Adam.                                                                      |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=54.0)   | Let's get into color.                                                                               |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=55.0)   | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=56.0)   | So we're going to start with some color types.                                                      |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=57.36)  | We love talking about types and colors definitely typed in our CSS.                                 |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=61.32)  | And we in episode six cover all the places that you can use color like in text color,               |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=66.26)  | background color, borders, gradients and more.                                                      |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=69.28)  | But let's say you've used a whole bunch of color and it's been a whole cycle on a product           |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=73.84)  | and multiple teammates have been hacking on it and it's just kind of getting a little               |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=76.84)  | wild.                                                                                               |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=77.84)  | Well, how can we debug, inspect and study the colors used in the browser?                           |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=82.44)  | Well here's Jesslyn to introduce ways to look at one color, all the colors or simulate              |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=86.68)  | a display with limited or advanced sets of colors, all from DevTools.                               |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=91.1)   | And in DevTools, there are three primary ways to debug color.                                       |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=95.36)  | There's the elements panel, which Jesslyn is going to talk about where you can make                 |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=98.16)  | adjustments to CSS styles on any given UI elements.                                                 |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=101.84) | And inside this panel, you also have access to the color picker tool, which has a lot               |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=105.9)  | of great features in it itself.                                                                     |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=109.24) | Then there's also the CSS overview panel that Adam is going to talk about.                          |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=112.92) | This is a really robust way to have an overview of all the CSS in your page and kind of help        |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=118.28) | you make broader decisions about your styles.                                                       |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=121.52) | And in this episode, we're talking about colors, the color on your page.                            |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=125.14) | Then there's also the emulation tools, which are in the rendering tab.                              |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=129.3)  | And that is a great way to emulate color on your page and help make decisions based on              |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=135.6)  | different ways that your user might see your page, whether that's a theme color or a visual         |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=140.28) | perception change.                                                                                  |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=141.68) | Nice, let's start with the elements panel.                                                          |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=145.04) | Suppose you want to change the text color of a paragraph to maroon color.                           |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=149.84) | Select the element in the elements panel.                                                           |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=152.6)  | Then you set the color property to maroon in the styles pane.                                       |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=157.04) | Then you see a small icon next to the color definition that shows the color preview.                |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=162.72) | Well, we always experiment with different colors during designing.                                  |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=167.86) | You can open the color picker to play with different colors and opacity.                            |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=172.24) | Just click on the color preview icon.                                                               |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=175.0)  | The bottom of the color picker is a color palette.                                                  |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=178.48) | By default, it shows a list of your page's colors.                                                  |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=182.36) | Click on one of the colors.                                                                         |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=183.98) | It will update the value with a color string.                                                       |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=187.32) | This is useful, but nowadays I use CSS variables a lot in my color value.                           |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=193.84) | So the default color palette isn't that useful for me.                                              |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=197.88) | The cool thing here is you can actually change the color palette to CSS variables.                  |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=203.32) | Expand the color palette section and choose the CSS variables option.                               |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=208.12) | Now the color palette displays the list of colors I define as CSS variables.                        |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=213.92) | Try to select a color now.                                                                          |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=215.88) | The color value is updated with the CSS variable instead of a color string.                         |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=221.16) | Pretty cool, right?                                                                                 |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=222.16) | Yeah, it's like creating your own custom color palette based on your design system.                 |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=228.12) | Because when you open up the color picker, all of your colors are there.                            |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=230.76) | The page colors or your custom theme colors.                                                        |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=232.64) | It is pretty cool.                                                                                  |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=233.64) | It's like a little color spider crawled through all of your style sheets and was like, oh,          |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=238.4)  | I found another color.                                                                              |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=239.4)  | I'll put it into the color picker, see?                                                             |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=241.72) | Anyway.                                                                                             |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=242.72) | When I'm illustrating, I always have to just like take the colors I'm using and put them            |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=247.08) | on the side of my art board.                                                                        |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=248.88) | And then like I drop copy and paste them to get the right shade for the brush.                      |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=252.96) | But here DevTools is doing it for you.                                                              |

| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=259.48) | All right.                                                                                          |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=260.48) | Well, let's talk about the CSS overview next.                                                       |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=262.36) | And this is for getting a view of all your styles or all your colors from a bird's eye              |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=266.36) | view or a macro perspective.                                                                        |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=268.24) | And this can like help you holistically evaluate the CSS, see a bit into your design system         |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=273.52) | and discover unused or maybe overused CSS.                                                          |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=277.24) | To find the CSS overview, open DevTools and find the three dots next to the close button            |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=281.36) | in the top right corner.                                                                            |

| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=287.64) | It used to be an experiment, but it's proved itself so useful that it made it into Stable.          |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=291.8)  | All right.                                                                                          |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=292.8)  | And once it's open, smash that capture button to kick it off.                                       |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=296.36) | And here's what you'll get.                                                                         |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=297.82) | An overview summary is at the top, including the number of external style sheets, inline            |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=302.4)  | styles, counts of your rules, selectors, and a lot more.                                            |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=306.76) | It even counts the number of complex selectors on the page.                                         |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=310.32) | Underneath that summary is a color breakdown.                                                       |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=313.18) | So you can see the colors by grouped by CSS property like background colors, text colors,           |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=318.08) | and border colors.                                                                                  |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=319.48) | Click on a color to see a list of elements that are using that color.                               |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=322.52) | And I really like how this reverses the normal way I look for colors by finding an element          |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=325.98) | and seeing what colors has it.                                                                      |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=328.06) | By this way, I find a color and then can easily find all the components using it.                   |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=331.36) | So it's kind of cool just reversing that query relationship, the way I'm trying to find elements.   |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=336.2)  | And all colors will be shown in hex right now in this overview.                                     |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=339.48) | And that's basically because it's representing computed value, not the authored values.             |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=343.72) | So you might have color issues where you're defining the same color in four different               |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=347.88) | formats.                                                                                            |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=348.88) | And the CSS overview would tell you that you've defined that color four times, but not necessarily  |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=353.16) | tell you which syntax it was used across those.                                                     |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=356.04) | So anyway, there's some improvements that can be made there, but still super valuable.              |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=360.6)  | Underneath that, it will find and fix low contrast text.                                            |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=364.28) | So the first part there is find.                                                                    |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=365.64) | So text colors get contrast scored when you hit that capture button.                                |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=369.64) | And this panel will report if it discovers text colors that don't meet AA or AAA requirements.      |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=374.2)  | Well, we have more on correcting accessible colors in another episode, but it's nice to             |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=377.98) | know that the CSS overview is helping folks find these colors.                                      |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=382.16) | Next is font information, which tallies font sizes, font weights, line heights, number              |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=385.92) | of families used.                                                                                   |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=386.92) | And it says things like, you used this font 20 times, or you have nine different font               |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=391.56) | sizes being used on the page, which is super insightful stuff.                                      |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=395.62) | Next is unused declarations, which points out styles that it found were unused on the               |

| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=401.04) | It also tells you if a style is used and wasn't even effective, like vertical line middle           |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=405.6)  | being used on something that is neither in line or a table cell.                                    |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=409.92) | Last is an overview of your media queries, where what you used and how many times you               |

| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=640.76) | Let's do it.                                                                                        |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=641.76) | Yeah, I'm down.                                                                                     |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=642.76) | I have one I do all the time because I'm constantly testing light and dark color schemes and making |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=647.68) | sure that they're just right.                                                                       |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=650.48) | I tend to do that with Command Shift P, which brings up the command palette, and then I             |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=654.6)  | just type light or dark and then it will show me an option for emulate prefers color scheme         |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=659.04) | light and I'll just be like, yes, do that.                                                          |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=660.84) | Then it will emulate light for the page.                                                            |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=663.16) | That's how I toggle back and forth between light and dark when I'm testing.                         |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=666.54) | I love that.                                                                                        |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=667.54) | The command palette is such a great pro tip for using DevTools because instead of having            |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=671.76) | to look through the menus to open the rendering panel formulation, you could just Command           |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=676.96) | Shift P and then search for that command.                                                           |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=681.44) | I think another great pro tip is hitting Shift Click on the color icon inside of your styles        |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=687.12) | panel to change the color format.                                                                   |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=689.84) | I think this is super useful.                                                                       |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=691.84) | I recently did this to grab a color that was a custom property in hex and change it to              |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=697.64) | an HSL format.                                                                                      |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=698.64) | All I had to do was find it, Shift Click, and it changed the format for me.                         |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=703.6)  | I didn't have to use an external tool or open up the color picker.                                  |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=709.84) | I could just do it right in the CSS directly and it was very quick and easy to do.                  |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=715.44) | I don't think a lot of people know about this, but Shift Click on the color icon and it will        |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=718.8)  | change the format.                                                                                  |

| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=742.56) | Does this change the actual color values on the page?                                               |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=746.16) | If you had hex, it converts to RGB or does this pull up the default for the color selection         |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vE7V3JZqRXs4XP24KkhF1?&t=751.9)  | into RGB?                                                                                           |
