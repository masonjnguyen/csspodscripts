| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.                     |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=18.0)    | We have done it Adam, we reached the end of our season two series.                                          |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=22.04)   | Yay!                                                                                                        |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=23.04)   | No.                                                                                                         |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=24.04)   | Yay!                                                                                                        |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=25.04)   | I wish that.                                                                                                |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=26.04)   | This season has been 23 episodes and this will make 24 and what a journey it's been.                        |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=31.08)   | From launching the Learn CSS online course on web.dev to covering everything from functions                 |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=37.08)   | and at rules to accessibility and different types of interaction and transforms.                            |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=42.2)    | We covered a lot in this season.                                                                            |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=44.58)   | And in this wrap up guide, we just wanted to sort of highlight some of our favorite                         |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=49.0)    | learnings and tips.                                                                                         |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=50.28)   | So we're going to go through all of this season's episodes and just highlight our favorite little           |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=54.8)    | trick or thing to watch out for about that topic and kind of give you an overview recap                     |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=59.64)   | of what that episode was about.                                                                             |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=61.28)   | So this will by no means be a deep dive into CSS or anything.                                               |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=65.92)   | We encourage you to check out the episodes on your own, but it'll be a good overview                        |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=70.38)   | of the topics that we covered over the past couple of months and in this season of the                      |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=74.96)   | CSS podcast.                                                                                                |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=75.96)   | Oh yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=76.96)   | Do you want to get started with the topics Adam?                                                            |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=80.8)    | I do.                                                                                                       |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=81.8)    | I do.                                                                                                       |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=82.8)    | It's so hard not to get technical in these because I go review all of our old ones.                         |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=86.76)   | I'm like, that was 20 minutes of dense stuff.                                                               |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=89.44)   | I'm like, geez, we pack it in.                                                                              |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=91.56)   | So this isn't going to be much more lighthearted.                                                           |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=93.56)   | And yes, I will start with lists.                                                                           |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=96.52)   | Episode 30.                                                                                                 |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=97.52)   | And for me, the biggest takeaway was list dash style.                                                       |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=100.92)  | That shorthand is a magical, magical shorthand into a big world full of emoji and SVG and                   |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=107.48)  | images and all sorts of international enumeration strategies just for lists.                                |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=112.76)  | And you know, you've got your OL, your UL and your DLs and you can start all those things                   |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=117.12)  | with all sorts of little handy symbols.                                                                     |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=119.0)   | So I thought that was really neat from that episode.                                                        |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=121.16)  | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                           |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=122.16)  | So next we have episode 31, which is all about at rules.                                                    |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=126.2)   | And this episode covered a lot of grounds, everything from app media and app supports,                      |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=131.26)  | feature queries to at font face and the font feature values.                                                |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=135.12)  | There was also, you know, key frames and scroll timeline and the CSS Houdini at property to                 |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=139.96)  | create CSS custom properties.                                                                               |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=141.56)  | And we even talked about print properties like app page.                                                    |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=144.64)  | So we talked about a ton of different at rules in this episode, which I use regularly.                      |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=147.6)   | And I think that the biggest takeaway for me from this episode is just this whole overview                  |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=152.4)   | of the CSS space and how customized you can really get with these at rules.                                 |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=157.76)  | And we actually did a few shows this season that go deeper into the high level concepts                     |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=162.76)  | that we introduced in this episode.                                                                         |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=164.52)  | So it was a nice overview of the ecosystem and the things that you can do with at rules.                    |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=168.4)   | Yeah, I've been thinking recently about at rules too, that they're portable style encapsulation             |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=173.64)  | and they're named.                                                                                          |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=174.64)  | So you can like name these groups of styles in an at rule and then pass.                                    |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=178.04)  | It's like it seems primo for design systems that like a component could import or just                      |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=182.48)  | use a named at rule for rules.                                                                              |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=184.52)  | Anyway, whatever, that was a good one.                                                                      |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=186.64)  | And it is, there's tons of really handy ones.                                                               |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=188.44)  | Depends on the at rules.                                                                                    |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=189.44)  | So definitely for like the definition ones, like the at font face rules, but then there's                   |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=193.2)   | also like at supports and at media.                                                                         |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=195.2)   | So they're used very differently from each other.                                                           |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=198.0)   | They are, yeah.                                                                                             |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=199.0)   | It's more like the animations, the counter styles, the fonts, you know, like things that                    |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=202.64)  | you can like bundle into a nice little name.                                                                |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=204.8)   | Yeah, super cool.                                                                                           |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=206.6)   | The next one we have here is from episode 32, page media queries.                                           |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=211.6)   | And I remember and especially want to point out that like detecting interaction features                    |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=216.16)  | like hover and pointer accuracy were really cool.                                                           |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=218.84)  | So just being able to tie into like, is it a mouse?                                                         |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=221.56)  | Does it have fine and high point accuracy or is the accuracy really coarse like a potato                    |

| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=228.36)  | And you know, I also have a soft spot for prefers reduced data and the rest of the preference               |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=232.32)  | media queries.                                                                                              |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=233.32)  | I just, they're just so cool.                                                                               |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=234.84)  | I love bringing in your preference into my UI and just doing it so transparently, you                       |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=239.92)  | know, just you don't even know.                                                                             |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=241.24)  | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=242.24)  | And that's a good transition to the next episode, which is episode 33, all about preference                 |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=246.04)  | media queries.                                                                                              |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=247.72)  | These preference media queries let you tailor your user experience to your user's experience.               |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=252.58)  | And this includes things like prefers reduced motion, prefers contrast, prefers color scheme                |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=256.92)  | for light and dark themes and a few more.                                                                   |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=259.56)  | So in this episode, we not only talked about when and where you would use these media queries,              |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=264.68)  | we also talked about the dev tools that you can use to debug them and style things based                    |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=269.28)  | on user preferences.                                                                                        |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=270.7)   | And like Adam said, like this is one of my favorite topics right now in CSS.                                |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=274.0)   | It's really creating a truly customized web experience for your users.                                      |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=278.54)  | And one of my favorite takeaways is also something that Adam likes to say, and that's reduced               |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=282.28)  | motion doesn't mean no motion.                                                                              |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=284.32)  | So make sure to add affordances for interactive behaviors, even if they have a reduced motion               |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=289.68)  | experience.                                                                                                 |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=290.68)  | So, so crucial.                                                                                             |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=291.68)  | Got it.                                                                                                     |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=292.68)  | I mean, yeah, feedback.                                                                                     |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=293.88)  | It's just so important.                                                                                     |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=295.2)   | Transition folks, you don't have to.                                                                        |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=296.2)   | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=297.2)   | It's not like a robot transformer.                                                                          |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=298.2)   | Beep boop.                                                                                                  |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=299.2)   | Anyway, okay, episode 34 is overflow.                                                                       |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=303.34)  | And a critical aspect of overflow is that it creates a block formatting context.                            |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=307.88)  | And if that term is not resonating with you right now, I would go listen to that episode                    |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=312.44)  | again because it's a critical aspect of something that is overflowing.                                      |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=316.32)  | And overflowing, when scroll bars are set to visible or the system OS has them set to                       |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=320.6)   | visible, they take up space and they compete for space.                                                     |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=324.04)  | Do you remember where?                                                                                      |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=325.04)  | It's the padding box.                                                                                       |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=326.78)  | The padding box is where scroll bars go.                                                                    |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=329.68)  | It's just another critical takeaway from that episode.                                                      |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=332.44)  | And some complimentary scroll properties are really fun to think about too and make sure                    |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=335.92)  | that that scroll interaction has some scroll behavior and some over scroll behavior so                      |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=341.2)   | you can really tailor that scroll experience and make sure it's just right.                                 |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=345.24)  | I feel like this is one of those episodes that you don't really think about these topics                    |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=349.64)  | that much when you're just everyday coding, but it's an area that I feel like people run                    |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=355.64)  | into a lot of bugs and just really understanding it helps to debug your UX a lot.                           |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=362.88)  | So lots of concepts in there that you could learn a lot from for sure in this episode.                      |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=367.24)  | 100%.                                                                                                       |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=368.24)  | Yep.                                                                                                        |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=369.24)  | Next we have backgrounds.                                                                                   |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=370.24)  | So in C535, backgrounds are an essential part of CSS.                                                       |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=372.88)  | I feel like this was something we should have probably talked about in the first season,                    |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=375.8)   | but we forgot to include some essentials like backgrounds.                                                  |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=380.96)  | Use backgrounds all the time and knowing how to get a background to look the way you want                   |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=384.6)   | it is really key to making your life easier as someone who styles websites and apps.                        |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=389.56)  | So in this episode, we covered things like background color and background image, as                        |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=392.88)  | well as all the parts of background positioning, size, repeat, clip, origin, and attachment,                |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=398.0)   | which you can use to create some cool parallax effects.                                                     |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=400.84)  | One fun thing I learned from this episode was the background repeat keywords like round                     |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=405.2)   | and space.                                                                                                  |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=406.76)  | The browser does so much calculation for you to determine how to tile a pattern and just                    |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=411.92)  | seeing the differences is pretty cool.                                                                      |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=415.0)   | We'd like talk about the differences on this episode and get stoked about them.                             |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=418.24)  | And we also ended this episode with a shout out to background blend mode, which lets you                    |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=422.04)  | mix multiple backgrounds together and make some other neat effects.                                         |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=425.28)  | Nice.                                                                                                       |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=426.28)  | We could issue a challenge to JavaScript to recreate round and space repeat keywords and                    |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=431.96)  | be like, hey, let's see how...                                                                              |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=433.44)  | That would be so heavy.                                                                                     |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=435.56)  | I know.                                                                                                     |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=436.56)  | That's why I was setting them up for a whole big task.                                                      |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=439.2)   | Anyway, excellent recap of background.                                                                      |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=441.92)  | Episode 36 was text and typography.                                                                         |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=444.74)  | And I remember specifically that the lighter and bolder keywords, which I've been using                     |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=448.64)  | for many years, are relative.                                                                               |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=451.4)   | They're relative.                                                                                           |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=452.4)   | I mean, they sound relative, like make it bolder, make it lighter.                                          |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=455.16)  | And you're like, well, I don't know.                                                                        |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=457.2)   | But for all these years, I've been using them as kind of like absolute values.                              |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=460.24)  | Like lighter was I thought just like the lightest and bolder was the boldest that it could get.             |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=466.36)  | But no, that's just not the case.                                                                           |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=468.32)  | So anyway, specifically remember that one.                                                                  |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=470.2)   | We have text decoration, wave overline was another one I really like.                                       |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=474.44)  | I thought that was awesome.                                                                                 |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=475.94)  | And then I had a demo where I combined that with HD colors for this really vibrant overline.                |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=481.44)  | And yeah, I think I used the word overstand, which is I just love that word too.                            |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=485.68)  | Anyway, letter spacing.                                                                                     |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=487.42)  | This was really tricky is not gaps between your letters.                                                    |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=490.68)  | Letter spacing is more like letterbox width.                                                                |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=493.7)   | And that was a really tricky learning for me to get from that episode as well.                              |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=497.4)   | Specifically remember text align start and end.                                                             |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=499.44)  | We got our logical alignments, tons of variable font features.                                              |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=502.96)  | I mean, tons.                                                                                               |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=503.96)  | But for some reason, I just remember at Swash, at Swash.                                                    |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=508.24)  | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=509.24)  | And it's just so memorable.                                                                                 |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=510.24)  | Anyway, and editing font properties can really help aid or create cumulative layout shift.                  |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=516.04)  | So CLS was another thing from the text and typography episode.                                              |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=518.8)   | It's like, whoa, we really can really change the way our page is appearing and like jittering               |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=524.6)   | around just being really conscious about our font properties and how we're setting these                    |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=528.0)   | things up.                                                                                                  |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=529.0)   | So lots and lots in that episode.                                                                           |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=531.16)  | That was a pretty heavy episode and a very big topic.                                                       |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=533.6)   | So you covered that pretty well.                                                                            |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=535.56)  | Next we have Cursors and Pointers, episode 37.                                                              |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=538.94)  | There are a few different interaction modalities that you need to style for in modern sites                 |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=543.24)  | and apps, and that's touch, keyboard, and pointers.                                                         |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=545.74)  | So in this episode, we focused on pointers where you can style the cursor and specify                       |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=550.32)  | pointer events.                                                                                             |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=551.32)  | We talked about how you can use media queries to specify styles based on if a pointer input                 |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=557.32)  | device is present and how fun of a pointer it is.                                                           |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=560.54)  | And then we went through a big fun list of cursor types that you can use to help your                       |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=565.36)  | users get some feedback on what they're pointing to, usually hovering over to give insight                  |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=572.16)  | into how they can interact with that element.                                                               |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=574.92)  | Yeah, they were so whimsical too.                                                                           |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=577.16)  | And I'm thinking right now, do you remember in Jurassic Park, the little animated gif                       |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=581.16)  | of the guy when you got the password wrong and it goes, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.                             |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=586.2)   | I'm like, can I turn that into a cursor animation so that when you're trying to click a disabled            |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=590.08)  | button, it's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.                                                                      |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=592.72)  | That's really cute.                                                                                         |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=593.72)  | You definitely could.                                                                                       |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=594.72)  | Yeah, you could create a bunch of custom pointers, which were very in in the nineties.                      |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=597.92)  | So in, um, I'm sure there's someone out there who's just like, I created a thousand and                     |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=601.56)  | that's how I made my millions.                                                                              |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=602.76)  | I sold cursors.                                                                                             |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=603.76)  | All right.                                                                                                  |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=604.76)  | Episode 38, End Match Notation, right?                                                                      |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=608.76)  | A mini syntax episode.                                                                                      |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=610.48)  | And this is for enth child, enth last child, enth of type, and enth last of type.                           |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=614.32)  | And you can set patterns inside of there.                                                                   |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=616.04)  | So it's functional and you can specify a pattern of matching and the pattern, it goes pattern               |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=622.28)  | plus offset.                                                                                                |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=623.68)  | So if you have two and plus one, it's every two items.                                                      |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=627.48)  | That's the two end.                                                                                         |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=628.48)  | That's the pattern.                                                                                         |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=629.48)  | And then the offset is starting at the first item.                                                          |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=631.92)  | So starting at the first item, go every other item.                                                         |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=634.64)  | And that's the same thing as odd.                                                                           |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=636.4)   | So two and plus one is a pattern of every other one starting at number one.                                 |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=640.76)  | Uh, so I, I don't know, sometimes like mini syntaxes, they, they look so weird at first                     |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=645.68)  | and then hopefully we broke that one down and you were able to get a really good grip                       |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=648.66)  | on it, but they can also be used.                                                                           |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=650.6)   | This was a mission critical thing from that episode is you can use them for a type of                       |

| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=659.32)  | So if you've ever had that flex box bug where like the fifth item in your grid is like way                  |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=663.38)  | longer and wider than the rest or something like that, you can go in and reach in to when                   |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=668.0)   | there are five items and change a flex basis and correct something because you can quantity                 |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=674.1)   | query on children.                                                                                          |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=675.74)  | So very neat tricks in that episode.                                                                        |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=678.08)  | Yeah, there's definitely a lot of like interesting hacks that you can use and the child for it.             |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=683.88)  | We covered those at the end of that episode.                                                                |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=686.16)  | That's fun to take a listen to.                                                                             |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=687.76)  | Then we get to episode 39, all about paths, shapes, clipping and masking.                                   |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=693.12)  | You can use shapes and CSS in three different ways.                                                         |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=695.56)  | You can use them for clipping like clip path, masking like text effects and exclusions like                 |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=701.16)  | shape outside to allow for text to flow around a shape and do some cool editorial effects                   |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=707.16)  | that way.                                                                                                   |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=708.16)  | So in this episode, we talked about how to make shapes, basic ones like circle, ellipse                     |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=711.32)  | and polygon and how to create more complex shapes with paths similar to SVG paths.                          |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=717.28)  | We also talked about some examples of and how to use clipping and masking.                                  |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=721.56)  | You have to use a shape for clipping and an image for masking.                                              |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=724.52)  | So you can use images here as well.                                                                         |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=726.28)  | And a cool thing to do with images is to use ones that aren't just black and white, but                     |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=730.12)  | have some gray in them to create effects that transition from fully opaque to transparent                   |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=734.8)   | more gradually and create like some gradation gradient effects.                                             |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=739.24)  | You can also use something like background clip text on text elements along with color                      |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=744.36)  | transparent to create a knockout text effect, letting the text become a clipping path while                 |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=750.6)   | it doesn't have any color itself.                                                                           |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=752.52)  | It's transparent so you can see the layer behind it and you can use this to do like                         |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=756.32)  | glitter text or like rainbow text or cloud text.                                                            |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=761.8)   | And yeah, just another way to use clipping and masking that's a little bit more dynamic                     |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=766.2)   | because you could also do like content editable text and see that effect live.                              |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=770.2)   | Totally.                                                                                                    |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=771.2)   | Put that right over top of a cool video of some effect and yeah, make it editable.                          |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=775.36)  | I'm surprised some of these things aren't used more often, but I don't know.                                |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=778.44)  | I suppose they're still kind of niche.                                                                      |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=780.56)  | Excellent recap.                                                                                            |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=781.56)  | When you said knockout, I just thought of a cuphead and they go ding, ding, ding knockout.                  |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=784.68)  | And I'm like, that's how it works.                                                                          |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=786.24)  | Should we knockout text?                                                                                    |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=787.24)  | I want to do a little knockout text demo with knockout.                                                     |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=789.28)  | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                           |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=790.28)  | Yeah, that is how it knocks.                                                                                |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=791.28)  | It just like punches it.                                                                                    |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=795.24)  | Episode 40 was at font face and this is you can load and set properties on fonts for easy                   |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=800.64)  | use.                                                                                                        |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=801.64)  | They're just portable chunk of font styles.                                                                 |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=803.44)  | Portable.                                                                                                   |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=804.44)  | That was what I was talking about earlier with like design systems.                                         |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=805.94)  | You can just like name this whole thing and then just use it all at once.                                   |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=809.32)  | And so you'd be like this font wants to opt into this entire chunk of font styles and                       |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=812.96)  | it's super cool.                                                                                            |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=814.38)  | You can use font display to customize how a loaded font swaps with the fallback.                            |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=819.2)   | So we talked about font display and swapping.                                                               |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=822.56)  | And I remember it was really neat that you could specify a Unicode range as a performance                   |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=826.52)  | optimization so that you only load like the super rad ampersand of this font instead of                     |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=831.8)   | grabbing the entire thing.                                                                                  |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=833.04)  | You're like, no, I want to pluck just one character and it's and it lets you do that.                       |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=837.6)   | So cool.                                                                                                    |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=838.6)   | Yeah, I've done that before because I actually just really didn't like the ampersand that                   |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=843.16)  | I was using for my header fonts, but I liked all the other characters.                                      |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=846.8)   | So I just use a different ampersand and had that load in and kind of take over.                             |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=851.08)  | Yeah, cool.                                                                                                 |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=853.4)   | Next up, transforms, episode 41.                                                                            |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=855.6)   | CSS transforms are a big topic in CSS.                                                                      |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=858.88)  | You can do 2D or 3D transformations to adjust elements.                                                     |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=862.52)  | And this can be at a baseline or combined with animations and transitions or other                          |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=867.04)  | transforms to create a cool reactive effect and like really build on each other.                            |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=871.72)  | So common 2D transforms include scale, translate, rotate and skew, while 3D transforms include              |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=878.78)  | rotate 3D, scale 3D and matrix 3D, which are all ways to transform the X, Y and Z axes                      |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=885.6)   | of an element altogether.                                                                                   |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=887.92)  | Perspective also comes into play with 3D transformations and any of them, like in the 2D and 3D transforms, |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=894.7)   | can be written in longhand and broken out like scale X, scale Y and scale Z.                                |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=900.6)   | And you can also just group them and write them all together and like have a space separate                 |

| [15:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=934.2)   | There's a great article on app property with transforms and they're doing bounce effects                    |

| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=941.08)  | So they use app property to create some numbers and then they do math on the numbers in a                   |

| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=993.36)  | I'm a big fan.                                                                                              |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=994.36)  | Every time I go do my scroll snap, I'm like, ah, these are so cool.                                         |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=997.2)   | Yeah, I turn them on just like you do the grid overlay.                                                     |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=999.48)  | But with snap points, some crucial things that I thought from that episodes were a parent                   |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1004.16) | becomes a snap port, like a box for things to align within.                                                 |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1007.64) | So the parent, you know, initiates itself as that.                                                          |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1010.16) | Oh, my scroll port can be aligned to by children.                                                           |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1013.02) | And one, there's kind of a hot secret if you only have one, or many children can define                     |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1018.4)  | when and where they want to snap.                                                                           |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1020.6)  | It works killer with flex and grid.                                                                         |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1023.32) | And it has some really nice JavaScript APIs to help interact with it programmatically.                      |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1027.2)  | But I think snap points are critical for having epic touch interactions.                                    |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1031.54) | And I think we're going to see this area improve over time.                                                 |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1034.44) | Wink, wink, nod, nod, wink, wink, nod.                                                                      |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1037.08) | Yeah, and I can also see more people adopting snap points with more storytelling based experiences          |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1043.36) | and app like experiences too.                                                                               |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1045.88) | Episode 43 now is all about containment.                                                                    |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1049.7)  | Containment is a way to tell a browser that content can be isolated in a subtree of the                     |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1053.32) | page away from the rest of the content, which can lead to some pretty cool performance wins.                |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1057.84) | Plus containment is the CSS property that grants us access to be able to query containers                   |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1062.84) | and thus give us container queries.                                                                         |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1065.4)  | Yay!                                                                                                        |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1066.9)  | You can set paint, size, layout, and style containment and also specify on which access                     |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1071.72) | you're containing things.                                                                                   |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1072.72) | So you could do like contain inline size.                                                                   |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1074.88) | That would be the inline direction for the size so that you're not like squashing the                       |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1079.14) | element by containing the block size and it still maintains its own block space.                            |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1084.48) | There's also a cool capability of using the content visibility property with the auto                       |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1088.28) | value.                                                                                                      |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1089.36) | So content visibility auto skips rendering for an element's content until it's needed.                      |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1094.24) | So for example, like when it's about to enter the viewport.                                                 |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1097.76) | So you can have a big list of content that isn't causing a slow load and it sort of virtualizes             |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1103.04) | the rendering of that content while keeping it in the DOM.                                                  |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1106.54) | So it's still accessible in the DOM, it's still searchable in the DOM, it's an accessibility                |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1109.46) | tree and users can like search and get to it.                                                               |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1113.2)  | But it's not being rendered.                                                                                |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1115.6)  | It skips that rendering until it's needed.                                                                  |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1117.6)  | Yeah, that's a neat one.                                                                                    |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1120.32) | Just blows my mind to think about the potential of that one.                                                |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1122.76) | Excellent breakdown.                                                                                        |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1123.76) | So we're going to go to episode 44 on transitions.                                                          |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1127.04) | So app property, this is a critical thing I thought from transitions can help bring interpolation           |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1131.52) | to otherwise discrete or string values, right?                                                              |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1135.2)  | You've got like a linear gradient and the browser is like, that's a big string.                             |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1138.32) | And you're like, well, wait, wasn't it something I could animate?                                           |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1141.08) | And they're like, no, it's a big string.                                                                    |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1142.92) | But if you use app property, you can set something very specific in that string to be typed and             |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1147.64) | the browser will maintain that type and allow you to interpolate on it.                                     |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1150.48) | Just so cool the way that that works.                                                                       |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1152.84) | Another fun tip from that episode was a negative transition delay can help you test long running            |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1157.0)  | animations halfway through.                                                                                 |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1158.36) | So you can start it instead of watching your 10 second animation getting to the end and                     |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1162.24) | going, ah, the time is up.                                                                                  |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1164.02) | You could set it back in time so that it starts at nine seconds and then you just watch the                 |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1167.8)  | finish.                                                                                                     |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1168.8)  | It's just a really cool trick.                                                                              |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1169.92) | And often all that's needed is the transition set on an interaction to like a new value.                    |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1175.4)  | So this is like something else with transitions I like.                                                     |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1177.16) | There's already a value set, right?                                                                         |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1178.62) | Since every value has a default, there's usually something meaningful to come from.                         |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1182.58) | And so what you really only need to do is set it to.                                                        |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1184.68) | So like top zero or translate X zero, those are defaults and you only need to go to a                       |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1189.76) | new spot.                                                                                                   |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1190.76) | So transitions, like do you think about an interaction then just going to somewhere new.                    |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1194.8)  | And it's capable of different entrances than exits with some clever use like changing the                   |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1199.48) | transform origin.                                                                                           |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1200.58) | So on hover, you get an animation that goes in, but the transform origin was changed.                       |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1204.96) | And so when the mouse goes out, exits from a different location.                                            |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1207.78) | So some really cool transition tips in that episode.                                                        |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1210.32) | That was a great one.                                                                                       |
| [20:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1211.32) | Yeah, and this is another episode that we put out the Learn CSS course and realized,                        |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1217.4)  | oh, we're having, we have animations.                                                                       |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1219.36) | We talk about like color, we talk about all the elements of transitions, but we forgot                      |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1222.6)  | to include like a transition specific module.                                                               |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1227.04) | So we wanted to make sure that we got that covered in the season.                                           |
| [20:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1229.96) | And it was a good thing to go over because that I use on every single website I've ever                     |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1234.48) | made.                                                                                                       |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1235.48) | Yeah, seriously.                                                                                            |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1236.48) | Now we're at episode 45, which is scroll timeline.                                                          |
| [20:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1239.68) | And scroll timeline is one of the coolest things happening in CSS right now, but it                         |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1243.28) | is still an experimental property only available as an experiments in Chromium based browsers.              |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1248.08) | So keep that in mind for this episode.                                                                      |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1250.12) | I think it's intent to ship is coming up.                                                                   |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1252.2)  | It is not at the time of this recording in stable browsers, but.                                            |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1256.28) | Yeah, it's not in a stable browser, but they're planning on it.                                             |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1259.64) | I think in 93 or 94.                                                                                        |
| [21:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1261.44) | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1262.44) | So it should be in a Chromium based stable browsers in the hopefully weeks to come.                         |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1269.14) | But it's still definitely an experiment that you can't really use in Firefox as far yet,                    |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1273.68) | but hopefully soon we'll see what happens.                                                                  |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1276.72) | Scroll timeline is a primitive that allows us to tie web animations, not only to time                       |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1281.2)  | based events, but now to scroll based events.                                                               |
| [21:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1285.0)  | So you know, like those length of page trackers you see on some content sites, this makes                   |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1289.46) | it a lot easier to implement things like that or to orchestrate elements entering, exiting                  |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1294.64) | and interacting on the page based on the position of a scroller.                                            |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1298.68) | So in this episode, we go over how to do that, the primitives that you need to create scroll                |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1302.82) | timeline effects, like scroll offsets, time range, source and orientation.                                  |
| [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1307.88) | So that you have the tools to create really nice robust scroll effects with scroll timeline                 |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1313.08) | for when this is available everywhere.                                                                      |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1314.94) | And also now is the perfect time to experiment with it.                                                     |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1317.68) | Yes.                                                                                                        |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1318.68) | I can't wait for that one.                                                                                  |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1319.68) | Cannot wait.                                                                                                |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1320.68) | So rad.                                                                                                     |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1321.68) | Episode 46 was on custom properties.                                                                        |
| [22:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1324.22) | And I remember very specifically, there were two different types.                                           |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1327.64) | There was willy nillies and there were typed custom props.                                                  |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1331.44) | And what I mean by willy nillies is that they can take anything.                                            |

| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1335.44) | They're like, I don't know, am I holding JavaScript?                                                        |
| [22:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1337.84) | Am I holding a string?                                                                                      |

| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1339.84) | It doesn't even know or care.                                                                               |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1341.4)  | But then you can use app property to type them.                                                             |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1344.08) | And then it's like, I do care.                                                                              |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1345.6)  | I can only contain this certain stuff.                                                                      |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1348.9)  | And that means you can expect some things from me.                                                          |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1350.54) | So anyway, that was really cool.                                                                            |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1351.76) | Like the willy nillies first typed.                                                                         |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1353.44) | Nice to have both of those available.                                                                       |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1355.76) | You can use from JavaScript, you can say style.setproperty and dash dash prop name, comma value.            |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1361.28) | And you can interact with these from JavaScripts.                                                           |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1363.08) | It sounds like an old person.                                                                               |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1365.68) | You could use JavaScripts to hook into these.                                                               |
| [22:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1369.76) | But you can tie them up to things like sliders and stuff that make it really nice to change                 |
| [22:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1372.88) | values and then immediately see the reactive effect in CSS.                                                 |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1376.04) | It'll do it all the same.                                                                                   |
| [22:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1377.04) | Fun little note from that episode was that dash dash is a valid variable name.                              |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1381.32) | So you could just do at supports dash dash colon whatever in at supports and it would                       |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1387.36) | be like, yeah, I understand what that is.                                                                   |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1389.08) | But humans would be like, what is going on in that?                                                         |
| [23:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1392.72) | Anyway, that's maybe not that funny.                                                                        |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1394.44) | It's funny to me.                                                                                           |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1395.44) | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1396.44) | Wouldn't recommend it.                                                                                      |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1397.44) | I'd recommend you add a name.                                                                               |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1398.44) | Wouldn't recommend that tip.                                                                                |
| [23:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1399.44) | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [23:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1400.44) | That's a bad tip.                                                                                           |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1401.44) | That's a tip to troll.                                                                                      |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1403.36) | Don't troll.                                                                                                |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1404.72) | Another one that was really fun was the billion laughs attack by nesting props inside of each               |
| [23:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1408.8)  | other.                                                                                                      |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1409.8)  | So it's like recursive nesting and turning into a billion different laws in your style                      |
| [23:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1414.88) | sheet really, really quickly and so much that you could crash your browser.                                 |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1418.16) | So they had to prevent it.                                                                                  |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1419.88) | Really interesting stuff.                                                                                   |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1420.92) | People getting really creative with custom properties can hold JavaScript.                                  |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1424.56) | So if you put some JavaScript in there and then get the property from JavaScript, you                       |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1428.16) | can evaluate it and turn a custom product like CSS.                                                         |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1431.8)  | Anyway, so CSS and JavaScript, there's like JavaScript in your CSS.                                         |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1435.48) | Whoa.                                                                                                       |
| [23:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1436.74) | And then the last little thing I did, I've never run into this, but I remember this from                    |
| [23:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1439.46) | that episode that you can create cyclical dependencies where like var A is equal to                         |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1443.54) | var B and var B is equal to var A and then just sit there and go around in a circle.                        |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1447.4)  | Like it's so common in JavaScript.                                                                          |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1448.56) | You're like, another cyclical dependency?                                                                   |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1450.76) | Ah.                                                                                                         |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1451.76) | But in CSS, it seems so rare, but there it is.                                                              |
| [24:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1454.16) | It's possible.                                                                                              |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1455.16) | So these are all the things like not to do.                                                                 |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1456.88) | Don't just leave it empty variable.                                                                         |
| [24:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1458.16) | They don't create.                                                                                          |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1459.16) | That was a list of precautions.                                                                             |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1462.92) | Cyclical dependencies, things to watch out for.                                                             |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1464.76) | But yeah, custom properties are super useful, especially when you give them syntax and use                  |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1472.44) | them in systems throughout your UI and with JavaScript.                                                     |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1475.6)  | That's one of my favorite things to do actually is to do the logic in JavaScript and then                   |
| [24:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1478.8)  | pass values over to CSS just for the styling.                                                               |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1481.96) | So episode 47 is next where we talked about is, where and nesting.                                          |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1486.28) | CSS is getting some pretty nice syntactic sugar for writing longer selectors and that                       |
| [24:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1491.12) | is the is and where pseudo classes.                                                                         |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1493.36) | These two are very similar in that writing something like a colon is and then in parentheses                |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1498.72) | h1 comma h2 where like the same thing, but with where like a colon where and then in                        |
| [25:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1505.84) | parentheses h1 comma h2.                                                                                    |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1507.76) | Well here the same visual results of h1a and then your styling h2a and then your styling.                   |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1515.68) | So this targets links in both the primary and secondary headers.                                            |
| [25:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1519.58) | It's a way to write things a little more succinctly, a little bit more clearly.                             |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1522.92) | You can also do like a colon is and then within the parentheses colon hover comma colon focus               |
| [25:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1528.48) | to style both the hover and focus effects at the same time.                                                 |
| [25:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1531.88) | The difference between is and where is that specificity.                                                    |
| [25:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1536.06) | So is takes the most specific of the list items as its specificity total and where squashes                 |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1541.68) | everything to a specificity total of zero.                                                                  |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1543.84) | And this is important because if you're building design systems and using this in a systemic                |
| [25:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1547.64) | way, you might want to use where over is, but if you want this to take precedence over                      |
| [25:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1553.08) | a base style like h1a, then you want to use is and that will use that specificity total                     |
| [25:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1559.36) | plus like where it is in the document order to make those decisions.                                        |
| [26:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1562.96) | So really, really useful to have these.                                                                     |
| [26:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1566.26) | It saves a lot of time writing and it also makes it a lot more succinct.                                    |
| [26:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1569.7)  | And because we have these primitives, it's making CSS native nesting possible, which                        |
| [26:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1574.44) | also is essentially a syntactic sugar over is and where, which are syntactic sugar overwriting              |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1579.02) | longer form selectors.                                                                                      |
| [26:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1580.48) | So the nesting spec is something that Adam is working on and definitely watch out for                       |
| [26:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1585.0)  | that because I'm excited to see that come to native CSS.                                                    |
| [26:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1587.56) | Yeah, me too.                                                                                               |
| [26:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1588.92) | So handy.                                                                                                   |
| [26:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1589.92) | So cool.                                                                                                    |
| [26:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1590.92) | Episode 48 is on touch interaction.                                                                         |
| [26:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1593.64) | And this is where, you know, tell the browser specifically what gestures to handle so that                  |
| [26:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1597.68) | you can take on some custom ones yourself.                                                                  |
| [26:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1599.84) | I remember that being a very important lesson here with touch action is telling it what                     |
| [26:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1603.24) | it should do because it by default does a whole bunch of stuff.                                             |
| [26:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1607.04) | Double tap, pinch to zoom, panning, you know, swiping with your finger and all sorts of                     |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1611.16) | stuff.                                                                                                      |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1612.16) | And you're like, well, here I'm building, like this happened to me the other day.                           |
| [26:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1613.76) | I was building a switch and the switch I wanted to be swipey and I needed to tell the browser               |
| [26:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1618.68) | what it should do very specifically.                                                                        |
| [27:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1621.0)  | And in the case of like a horizontal swipe, I'm like, you should only pan Y, do not pan                     |
| [27:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1625.64) | X.                                                                                                          |
| [27:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1626.64) | I'm panning X now.                                                                                          |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1628.64) | And it worked out really nice.                                                                              |
| [27:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1629.82) | Like on an iPad, it used to make the whole page kind of wiggle as you swipe, but now                        |
| [27:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1633.44) | it doesn't because well, it's like I have taken over the gestures for that element.                         |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1638.28) | So touch interaction, I remember that the touch action property being really helpful                        |
| [27:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1642.64) | there.                                                                                                      |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1643.64) | And it's also, you know, like if you're building scrollable areas and stuff to know how touch               |
| [27:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1647.88) | interaction is working with all these things and what properties you have.                                  |
| [27:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1650.8)  | So if you're building things for touch, which I hope you are, make sure to listen to that                   |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1654.36) | touch interaction episode.                                                                                  |
| [27:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1655.36) | You might find some tidbits.                                                                                |
| [27:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1656.36) | Yeah, definitely a lot of great tips in that episode to check out.                                          |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1660.2)  | Next we're on episode 49, accessibility.                                                                    |
| [27:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1662.2)  | It's in the intro of all of our shows.                                                                      |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1664.6)  | Welcome to CSS Podcasts where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Zendesk.                        |
| [27:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1668.36) | Did they just play a track?                                                                                 |
| [27:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1669.36) | Oh no, that was actually you talking.                                                                       |
| [27:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1671.36) | Oh, okay.                                                                                                   |
| [27:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1672.36) | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [27:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1673.36) | So we thought that we'd devote an entire episode to accessibility.                                          |
| [27:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1677.06) | So in episode 49, we cover a bunch of accessibility related styling concerns like relative units            |
| [28:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1682.02) | and browser zoom, proper contrast scores, making things visually hidden but providing                       |
| [28:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1686.86) | context for screen readers, focus states and focus within, and preference media queries,                    |
| [28:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1692.52) | one of our favorite topics.                                                                                 |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1694.24) | We also shared some of our favorites, lint HTML with CSS tricks.                                            |
| [28:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1698.84) | The hashtag lint HTML with CSS is a fun hashtag on Twitter.                                                 |
| [28:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1702.96) | Definitely check out how some folks are linting semantics and accessibility with CSS by searching           |
| [28:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1708.44) | that hashtag on Twitter.                                                                                    |
| [28:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1709.88) | Lots of cool techniques from integration and build tools to just running it on any page                     |
| [28:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1714.08) | and just checking it out.                                                                                   |
| [28:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1715.88) | And that accessibility, yeah, that was a long time coming.                                                  |
| [28:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1718.0)  | And I think it was nice that we waited because it kind of encapsulates so many different                    |
| [28:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1721.88) | things that we talk about on the show.                                                                      |
| [28:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1724.36) | So it's just good.                                                                                          |

| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1728.36) | Oh, we're getting near the end of the list here.                                                            |
| [28:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1730.52) | Episode 50 was on inherit, initial, unset and revert.                                                       |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1733.96) | And I liked that this episode was a healthy reminder of where our author styles are in                      |
| [28:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1738.64) | the stack that applies to a page.                                                                           |
| [29:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1741.76) | And it's nice having use cases like having, or there were nice use cases for these, like                    |
| [29:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1746.4)  | having inputs inherit font properties or border radius matching a parent.                                   |
| [29:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1751.0)  | So kind of knowing what inherits and what doesn't makes it really important to know                         |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1755.92) | how to revert back to or bring something into your system.                                                  |
| [29:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1760.36) | So it's kind of like you're either excluding or including something very specifically.                      |
| [29:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1764.78) | And yeah, that was just a really good one.                                                                  |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1766.24) | I also remember no IE 11 support for unset or revert.                                                       |
| [29:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1770.32) | So some of these tricks might need to be reserved for your more modern web apps that you're                 |
| [29:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1775.2)  | building.                                                                                                   |
| [29:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1776.2)  | But anyway, that was episode 50.                                                                            |
| [29:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1777.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [29:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1778.2)  | Now we're on episode 51, which I feel like we just recorded.                                                |
| [29:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1781.72) | It feels like it was yesterday.                                                                             |
| [29:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1784.92) | This episode is all about styling SVG and CSS.                                                              |
| [29:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1787.96) | I had so much fun recording this episode and it was all about the intersection of CSS and                   |
| [29:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1792.56) | SVG.                                                                                                        |
| [29:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1793.56) | There are a ton of ways that you can style SVG using CSS.                                                   |
| [29:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1796.84) | If it's an inline SVG, you have control over styling any of the fills, strokes, text alignments,            |
| [30:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1802.04) | and more.                                                                                                   |
| [30:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1803.04) | And you can even group SVG elements together and animate them or apply transformation effects               |
| [30:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1807.32) | and transitions.                                                                                            |
| [30:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1808.98) | And it's not just that you can style SVGs using CSS.                                                        |
| [30:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1812.2)  | You can also use SVG definitions to apply filter effects through CSS to any of the elements                 |
| [30:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1817.9)  | on your page.                                                                                               |
| [30:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1818.9)  | You can add them to cool duotone effects or just any specific channel on UI elements.                       |
| [30:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1823.92) | You can even add noise and displacement and combine this with other effects like clipping                   |
| [30:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1827.84) | to make some interesting visuals.                                                                           |
| [30:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1830.08) | So this episode went into some SVG and CSS tricks as well, like how to change the color                     |
| [30:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1835.76) | of an SVG element, even when it's used as an image and not inlined on the page so you                       |
| [30:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1840.24) | don't have access to that fill.                                                                             |
| [30:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1841.64) | And how to create this drawing in effect with stroke offsets and a path design.                             |
| [30:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1846.36) | So you could have like some text or logo kind of being drawn in on the page as you enter                    |
| [30:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1851.2)  | the page or scroll through the page.                                                                        |
| [30:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1853.68) | And yeah, there's lots of ways that SVG interacts with CSS.                                                 |
| [30:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1857.32) | And honestly, my favorite part of SVG is that it is just instructions to the browser and                    |
| [31:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1862.16) | you can use it to create interactive components.                                                            |
| [31:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1865.76) | I feel like SVG alone, cool, but you can also send a PNG to get an image.                                   |
| [31:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1871.68) | But then when you combine it with styling, it really brings it to life and shows you                        |
| [31:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1876.4)  | how powerful it is to have this kind of image format available to us.                                       |
| [31:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1880.76) | That's a really good point is like, you know, that episode sounds so much like Photoshop.                   |
| [31:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1885.16) | Like look at all the cool things that Photoshop can do that CSS can do with SVG.                            |
| [31:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1889.22) | But you're right, there's a mad critical moment there, which is Photoshop is static and not                 |
| [31:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1896.0)  | interactive.                                                                                                |
| [31:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1897.18) | And as soon as you take something that looks not interactive, like some SVG shapes, you're                  |
| [31:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1901.76) | like, oh, those probably don't move.                                                                        |
| [31:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1903.36) | They're probably just an image, but then they change color or they grow or they draw in.                    |
| [31:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1906.84) | You're like, the web is magical.                                                                            |
| [31:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1910.28) | Then they move.                                                                                             |
| [31:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1911.28) | Yeah, that's just a great moment you can have with the web.                                                 |
| [31:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1913.24) | I think SVG is so powerful.                                                                                 |
| [31:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1915.4)  | I totally agree.                                                                                            |
| [31:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1916.4)  | Wow, we really like CSS, don't we?                                                                          |
| [31:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1919.08) | We're like each one of these episodes, I love this stuff.                                                   |
| [32:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1921.8)  | Yeah, well, it is the CSS podcast.                                                                          |
| [32:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1924.92) | We better be pumped about CSS or else we're doing it wrong.                                                 |
| [32:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1927.92) | Well, I'm now sad.                                                                                          |
| [32:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1929.4)  | I just went from being really happy about every bullet to now we're on our last item                        |
| [32:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1933.52) | here, which is episode 52 on counters and counter style.                                                    |
| [32:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1937.2)  | Maybe I'll just take this really slow so that I'll make the moment last.                                    |
| [32:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1942.04) | No, okay.                                                                                                   |
| [32:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1943.4)  | I like from that episode, how counter styles let me create these like little style bundles                  |
| [32:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1948.84) | about bullets, like little list bullet bundles and reading, you know, how many were pre-made                |
| [32:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1954.72) | and the spec was super neat.                                                                                |
| [32:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1956.64) | It was great for inspiration when I needed to write some of my own.                                         |
| [32:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1959.72) | And there's just a lot of really great examples in the spec of like how to create these little              |
| [32:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1963.32) | bullet bundles, these little style bullet bundles.                                                          |
| [32:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1966.16) | And counters can nest and reset.                                                                            |
| [32:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1968.68) | They can loop forever with algorithmic cycles.                                                              |
| [32:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1971.16) | They're packed with pure functions and expressions.                                                         |
| [32:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1974.46) | Counter reset, there's like this one line of code, I'm still amazed by it.                                  |
| [32:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1977.42) | So it's counter dash reset colon chapter space section space one.                                           |
| [33:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1981.78) | So it sets the chapter and the sections to one, like to start at one and then it says                       |
| [33:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1987.58) | page and it ends with page.                                                                                 |
| [33:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1988.92) | So page will start at zero, right?                                                                          |
| [33:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1990.24) | We always start at page zero in a document, but we do start at chapter one and section                      |
| [33:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1993.96) | one.                                                                                                        |
| [33:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1994.96) | And so these will nest and go on forever.                                                                   |
| [33:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1996.32) | So it's like as soon as you hit another H1, it's just going to reset.                                       |
| [33:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1998.88) | Oh, it's so cool.                                                                                           |
| [33:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=1999.88) | Anyway, lastly, I love thinking about how using counters in a game HUD, like a HUD for                      |
| [33:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2005.2)  | HUD elements, like the score, how many lives you have, what's the enemy health, all of                      |
| [33:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2009.06) | it.                                                                                                         |
| [33:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2010.06) | And how you can have all tallies representing and subscribing to a named counter system                     |
| [33:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2014.28) | that interactions like hover and checked can send increments to.                                            |
| [33:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2017.98) | It is so cool and powerful and flexible.                                                                    |
| [33:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2022.2)  | Just all of the CSS things all wrapped up in a nice little bundle.                                          |
| [33:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2026.24) | So good.                                                                                                    |
| [33:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2027.24) | Yeah.                                                                                                       |
| [33:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2028.24) | That episode got pretty deep about how you can style counters and create your own definitions               |
| [33:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2032.08) | too.                                                                                                        |
| [33:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7fsblWgyksTFmCfGHIgpB9?&t=2033.7)  | So now we're in episode 53 where we recap season two.                                                       |
