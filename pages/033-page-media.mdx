| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=16.8)    | We're going to get a little bit more narrow in scope and focus from our last show on at             |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=21.28)   | rules and talk a bit more about media queries today.                                                |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=25.12)   | That's at media.                                                                                    |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=26.92)   | There are so many media queries so we'll try to run through these quickly.                          |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=30.4)    | But media queries provide a lot of depth in terms of specifying style content based on              |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=34.8)    | device properties or page properties.                                                               |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=37.04)   | So we'll get into the types of media queries you can specify, like even print styles for            |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=42.2)    | printed pages, and how to do them.                                                                  |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=44.98)   | One thing that we aren't getting into in this episode is user preference media queries,             |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=48.92)   | which are usually operating system preferences.                                                     |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=51.58)   | And that's because stay tuned, we'll dive into those in our next episode.                           |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=55.2)    | Very nice.                                                                                          |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=56.2)    | We dropped those keywords in there really nice and sneaky.                                          |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=59.72)   | Media types and media features.                                                                     |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=61.04)   | Those are literally the names of the items in the spec, the key ingredients to a media              |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=65.12)   | query.                                                                                              |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=66.12)   | Well, then obviously the styles, you got to put those in there because that's crucial.              |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=68.64)   | You need to change something based on those features.                                               |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=71.4)    | But yes, well done.                                                                                 |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=72.92)   | We're focusing on that first part and the declaration of a page type and feature within             |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=77.48)   | it.                                                                                                 |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=78.48)   | And so yeah, like always, we're going to break this down.                                           |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=79.72)   | We'll break down app media and what comes after is a typed input.                                   |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=84.58)   | So the browser and the parser is expecting a certain syntax there.                                  |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=87.76)   | And the first thing it's looking for is the media type.                                             |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=91.2)    | Now media types are things like print screen and all.                                               |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=93.76)   | They used to have things like handheld Braille and oral and like some of these other things,        |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=97.32)   | but they've all been deprecated.                                                                    |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=98.48)   | We now pretty much have is the media that you're being displayed on print, screen, or               |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=104.28)  | all does it match both print and screen.                                                            |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=106.8)   | And the way that these work is even kind of funny to like print matches printers and devices        |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=110.6)   | intended to produce a printed display of the document.                                              |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=113.72)  | Like print and screen is basically like, are you not print?                                         |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=116.68)  | Ah, then you must be screen.                                                                        |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=118.52)  | I'm like, well, that's one way to build the logic into the system.                                  |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=122.08)  | And then all matches everything like cool.                                                          |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=124.2)   | So now we have three types, print screen and all and a screen just means you're not print.          |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=129.24)  | And yeah, that's pretty much it for that section.                                                   |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=131.14)  | There was a funny little part though about handheld because that was a type you could               |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=134.72)  | be like app media handheld.                                                                         |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=136.76)  | And it referred to those like ancient tiny little cell phones that we had back in the               |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=140.8)   | day, like when first browsers existed and all of the vendors and all the community was              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=146.0)   | like, wait, we don't want a media query that can target handheld devices specifically because       |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=149.84)  | then they're going to downgrade all of us to different experiences.                                 |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=154.8)   | And anyway, that fear led to the deprecation of the feature.                                        |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=158.04)  | And yeah, just kind of interesting.                                                                 |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=159.46)  | It's also, there's a note in the spec that all the media types will eventually deprecate            |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=163.16)  | in time in favor of media features, which is what we're about to talk about.                        |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=167.04)  | So this concept of media types could dwindle away and eventually be dust in the wind, but           |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=173.36)  | crappy falsetto.                                                                                    |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=174.36)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=175.36)  | So media types are more broad.                                                                      |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=178.9)   | So I think it's interesting, like an example of the deprecated types is TV.                         |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=182.38)  | Now you just use screen, even though you like, you will often access web interfaces on your         |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=186.84)  | TV, but you get more fine grain tests with media features.                                          |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=193.26)  | So with media features, you're testing a single specific feature of the user agent or display       |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=197.88)  | device and these media features are used to describe requirements of that output device.            |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=203.4)   | So you can use these along with media types.                                                        |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=205.88)  | So you can say like screen and, or use print media types along with media features, but             |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=211.52)  | they give you a little bit more refined control.                                                    |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=213.8)   | And I do think like things like print and screen are so different that those probably               |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=217.24)  | won't get deprecated just as media types.                                                           |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=220.14)  | Because if you're designing like a print book, then you're going to want to specify that's          |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=225.4)   | the media query that you're working with.                                                           |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=228.4)   | And you can't really get those with media features, but when you're writing media features          |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=231.86)  | are always wrapped in parentheses and combined with keywords.                                       |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=235.32)  | And some of the keywords are like and or, or so you can write a thing of like at media              |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=238.72)  | screen and max width colon 320 PX.                                                                  |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=242.52)  | And then that max width feature, those would be in a parentheses.                                   |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=245.84)  | So these are wrapped in parentheses.                                                                |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=248.64)  | You can also use the not and only keywords when writing complex media queries, but you              |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=252.84)  | have to use media types for not and only.                                                           |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=255.8)   | And we'll get into that a little bit more later.                                                    |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=258.14)  | Also a little shortcut.                                                                             |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=259.86)  | If the feature is a Boolean, you don't have to have the colon and the value.                        |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=264.12)  | You can just put the feature in there yourself.                                                     |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=265.44)  | So for example, hover is a media feature test that tests if the primary input mechanism             |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=271.36)  | allows the user to hover over elements.                                                             |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=273.84)  | And instead of writing like at media in parentheses hover or hover colon none, you can just write   |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=278.6)   | hover and it's a Boolean.                                                                           |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=279.6)   | So there's a couple of, you know, ways that we can write these Booleans are one of them.            |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=285.52)  | Another type of the media features is a range.                                                      |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=288.48)  | So you could use comparative values here and see which is lesser or greater.                        |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=293.76)  | You can have falsity and truthy values here.                                                        |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=295.96)  | So like negative numbers will be false.                                                             |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=298.44)  | There's also min and max.                                                                           |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=300.32)  | That is something that you'll see pretty often, especially when you do like a min width, max        |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=303.84)  | width and then a value.                                                                             |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=306.16)  | And there's also a newer way to write those that Adam will go over.                                 |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=309.72)  | And you could have a range type.                                                                    |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=311.6)   | So you have a range context that uses standard mathematical comparison operators instead            |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=316.6)   | of the colon with the example of like hover colon hover.                                            |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=321.96)  | You know, you don't have to have the colon with the value there, but you would need that            |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=325.92)  | if you did like min width, you know, colon and the value like 700 pixels or something.              |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=331.4)   | So yeah, another comparison type would have like the min or max prefix.                             |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=335.42)  | And these only accept single value.                                                                 |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=337.52)  | So you have the keyboard or number or your range values.                                            |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=341.38)  | So a way to also combine media features that I briefly mentioned earlier is using the and           |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=347.92)  | combinator.                                                                                         |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=349.24)  | You could write things like at media and then in parentheses min width 800 PX and max width         |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=355.76)  | 1200 PX.                                                                                            |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=357.22)  | That gives you a more narrowed range to write.                                                      |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=361.0)   | So this would be something that's between 800 pixels and 1200 pixels.                               |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=365.02)  | And then you can also use it to combine with other types.                                           |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=369.22)  | So if you had like at media TV and min width 700 PX, even though TV is deprecated, okay,            |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=375.86)  | at media screen and min width 700 PX.                                                               |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=379.56)  | And you could do in parentheses, again, orientation colon landscape that lets you adjust things     |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=384.62)  | based on your media type, your media feature being the minimum width and the orientation            |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=391.76)  | feature.                                                                                            |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=392.92)  | So that would be orientation landscape.                                                             |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=395.14)  | You can also use a comma to combine several media queries with one write time.                      |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=403.76)  | So you could combine several of them into a media query list.                                       |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=407.02)  | So something you could write would be like at media min width 700 PX comma orientation              |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=412.6)   | colon landscape.                                                                                    |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=414.0)   | And that would be for both features.                                                                |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=415.52)  | So it's not like a feature that has separation that you're requiring both.                          |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=421.26)  | It's not an and feature.                                                                            |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=422.48)  | It's a comma, look for both of these and apply these separately to both.                            |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=427.8)   | And then there's an example where you could do like at media screen and color and then              |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=431.56)  | comma projection and color.                                                                         |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=433.4)   | And so you're applying things to a screen type that is colored and a projection type                |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=438.76)  | that is colored.                                                                                    |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=439.76)  | So you could just get more specific.                                                                |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=443.32)  | There's also only.                                                                                  |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=445.26)  | So this one was interesting because when I was reading the spec, it said that the intention         |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=450.36)  | of this is hiding a media query from legacy user agents, which usually isn't like in the            |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=455.2)   | spec.                                                                                               |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=456.2)   | Like we made this so that you could hide media queries from old user agents.                        |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=460.54)  | This feels like a hack to me because of that, but it's really not.                                  |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=463.56)  | You need to use this in a lot of different places.                                                  |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=466.18)  | So you could write things like only screen and, and that would prevent older browsers               |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=470.2)   | that don't support media queries from running the styles.                                           |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=473.32)  | Another way that you can use this is when you're sending style sheets.                              |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=476.44)  | So media is an attribute that you can use on something like a link.                                 |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=480.4)   | So you can write like link rel="style sheet media equals only screen and color."                    |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=486.06)  | And then this is going to be used in modern browsers, this entire style sheet.                      |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=490.4)   | So the last one is not, and this lets you negate media features.                                    |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=495.44)  | So you could write not and then the parentheses color, and that matches any device without          |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=499.78)  | any kind of color display.                                                                          |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=501.38)  | You can get more specific.                                                                          |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=502.38)  | You could write like not screen and in parentheses color.                                           |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=505.84)  | And this would match everything except color screens.                                               |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=508.4)   | So you can get a little bit more specific in that realm, but not as a negation feature              |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=513.44)  | that works with media queries.                                                                      |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=515.08)  | Very nice.                                                                                          |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=516.08)  | So those were media features and media types.                                                       |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=518.14)  | We now know the two core essentials of creating media queries.                                      |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=521.88)  | And now we kind of get to do the fun part, which is like, okay, well now that we know               |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=524.36)  | how they're made of, like what are all the different abilities that we have with those?             |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=529.96)  | And okay, so you're going to start with page or viewport media queries.                             |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=533.24)  | So these are kind of the ones that are like your bread and butter, right?                           |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=535.4)   | This is like, what's the viewport width, what's the viewport height, what's the aspect ratio,       |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=540.06)  | what's the orientation.                                                                             |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=541.4)   | And then there's a kicker one here though, which is what's the display mode.                        |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=544.3)   | And that's coming from an installed PWA and it's trying to help you know how much viewport          |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=548.54)  | space you have because you are either full screen or have a minimal UI, or there's a                |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=553.2)   | couple of different ways that you can be displayed as a PWA.                                        |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=555.8)   | To recap those, the width page media query looks for the targeted display area of the               |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=560.62)  | output device and it accepts length units.                                                          |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=563.32)  | So you can do things like at media max width is 320 pixels, or you can do at media.                 |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=568.12)  | And here's a modern syntax one that's in the draft spec, but no browsers have implemented           |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=572.72)  | it.                                                                                                 |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=573.72)  | Instead of using max width or min width, you can just say width is less than or equal to            |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=578.04)  | 320 pixels.                                                                                         |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=579.52)  | So it kind of reads a little bit more like a mathematical expression and it will do the             |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=583.64)  | range work for you in there.                                                                        |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=585.08)  | So anyway, you can also write at media like 20 M is less than or equal to some other width,         |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=592.56)  | which is less than or equal to 70 M. You can sort of create this range span in the same             |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=596.88)  | sentence which you had above as well, where you can have like min width 800 pixels and              |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=601.88)  | max width is 1200 pixels.                                                                           |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=603.36)  | So there's a few ways to write these, but it's just nice to know that you have this                 |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=607.0)   | feature here.                                                                                       |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=608.0)   | You can check the width of the output device and pivot based on it.                                 |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=611.04)  | You can also do that with the height.                                                               |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=612.28)  | So that would be at media height, you know, and you could check for a pixel value there.            |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=616.56)  | There's also aspect ratio.                                                                          |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=617.98)  | So the ratio of the value of the width media feature to the value of the height media feature.      |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=622.52)  | So it takes a ratio.                                                                                |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=623.52)  | So it'd be like at media parentheses aspect dash ratio colon four dash three.                       |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=629.08)  | So is my viewport, is this device currently in a four by three aspect ratio?                        |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=634.12)  | And if it is, I can do something different, which is really similar to what we have with            |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=637.92)  | orientation.                                                                                        |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=638.92)  | So it's like is portrait when the value of the height media feature is greater than or              |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=642.8)   | equal to the value of the width media feature.                                                      |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=645.68)  | So you can basically check these two values, portrait or landscape at media open parentheses        |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=651.1)   | orientation colon portrait.                                                                         |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=653.24)  | And you can check, I use this one all the time because when you're squeezing the browser,           |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=657.4)   | you usually go from landscape to portrait and it tends to be that portrait moment that              |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=661.16)  | I like to pivot.                                                                                    |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=662.68)  | Anyway, and the browser support on these that I've listed so far is everywhere.                     |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=668.54)  | You have orientation aspect ratio height and width in every browser, but this display mode          |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=672.02)  | one that we talked about that applies to the top level browsing context that if you're              |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=675.64)  | being launched from a progressive web app from the home screen, that's only in Chrome               |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=680.16)  | and Firefox.                                                                                        |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=681.16)  | It's in Safari technical preview, but there's no IE there.                                          |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=684.5)   | So if you want to use that, that can be an upgrade path for you and just those browsers.            |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=688.44)  | But it's nice to know what are the values you can put in there is like at media open                |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=691.2)   | parentheses display dash mode colon full screen and parentheses.                                    |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=695.26)  | So it's like, is this display mode full screen?                                                     |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=697.52)  | I'm going to pivot with some styles.                                                                |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=699.24)  | Next we have the display quality queries.                                                           |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=701.48)  | So one of these is resolution.                                                                      |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=704.66)  | This queries for pixel density of the output device.                                                |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=707.78)  | So you could look for something like an exact resolution, like at media resolution, colon           |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=712.08)  | 150 DPI, and then send an image that works with a specific resolution.                              |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=717.6)   | An example of where you'd use this might be like background images that you send, um,               |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=721.32)  | based on if something is a high DPI or low DPI screen.                                              |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=725.16)  | You can also look for minimums and maximums.                                                        |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=727.44)  | So you could do something like min resolution, colon 72 DPI.                                        |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=731.42)  | So that would be at media and then in parentheses min dash resolution, colon 72 DPI.                |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=736.2)   | And then you're looking for a minimum resolution of 72 dots per inch, right?                        |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=741.04)  | Dots per inch?                                                                                      |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=742.04)  | Is that the way?                                                                                    |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=743.04)  | That's so like us centric dots per inch.                                                            |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=745.6)   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=746.6)   | Um, so yeah, you could write something like that and then, um, send like a higher quality           |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=753.32)  | image or so.                                                                                        |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=754.32)  | So that's resolution.                                                                               |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=755.44)  | Next we have grid.                                                                                  |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=756.98)  | This is a Boolean query, so it's either true or false.                                              |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=760.64)  | And this can be used to test whether the output device use a grid based screen.                     |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=764.74)  | An example of this would be, um, text only terminals or basic phones with only one fixed            |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=770.2)   | font.                                                                                               |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=771.58)  | And you're probably not going to run into that in modern web development, but this query            |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=775.84)  | is super old.                                                                                       |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=777.34)  | It's been around since Chrome one, uh, Firefox two and Safari version three.                        |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=781.36)  | So this has been around for a long time.                                                            |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=783.4)   | Um, yeah, you likely won't have to query for grid in your day to day development, but if            |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=789.36)  | you're, you know, developing for very, uh, unique old interfaces, this could be a, um,              |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=796.2)   | a choice for you.                                                                                   |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=797.2)   | I bet they wish they named that one different these days, huh?                                      |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=800.04)  | Yeah, right?                                                                                        |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=801.12)  | Because now we have grid everywhere.                                                                |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=802.36)  | Um, next we have overflow block and this one is only supported in Firefox, but it's used            |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=809.52)  | to test how the output device handles content that overflows the initial containing block.          |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=814.78)  | So with overflow block that's along the block axis in the values, there are none scroll             |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=820.2)   | optional page or page, and these values refer to the content.                                       |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=824.46)  | So if it's scrolled and that's sort of like the default that you're probably used to is             |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=827.96)  | that overflow content scrolls, the optional page would be content that you could scroll             |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=832.08)  | into, but it could also be triggered by page breaks.                                                |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=835.66)  | And so the example here I think of is, um, like an ebook and then there's also page and             |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=840.64)  | that's only page content.                                                                           |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=842.32)  | Content is broken up into discrete pages.                                                           |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=844.12)  | So along with overflow block, there's overflow inline again, similar support is overflow            |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=848.88)  | block that's only in Firefox, but this one is for the inline access.                                |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=853.56)  | So you have options here only to this time there's none in scroll and you could query               |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=858.32)  | for a page that scrolls in line or not.                                                             |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=860.68)  | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=861.68)  | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=862.68)  | So those were display quality queries.                                                              |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=863.76)  | I went over earlier page and viewport media queries and now we are on display color queries.        |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=869.28)  | The first one we have is color depth, but it's just the keyword color and this describes            |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=873.32)  | the number of bits per color in the component of the output device.                                 |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=876.12)  | So if the device is not a color device, the value is zero.                                          |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=879.2)   | It accepts integers for values.                                                                     |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=880.9)   | So something like one or 20 or something like that.                                                 |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=883.62)  | And it is also a range type.                                                                        |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=885.08)  | So it supports the min and the max syntax.                                                          |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=887.3)   | So this would be like at media open parentheses color, um, is, is color even present, you           |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=892.4)   | know, and then at media min color one, like does it have more than one color channel to             |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=896.24)  | work with?                                                                                          |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=897.32)  | And there's a small note here, which is color gamut is probably more relevant to what you're        |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=901.2)   | looking for plus, uh, but you know, I dunno, the browser support of color is really high.           |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=906.72)  | So there's some interesting use cases that I've seen, um, that use this color query.                |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=910.42)  | There's also color index, which describes the number of entries in the color lookup                 |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=913.68)  | table of the output device.                                                                         |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=915.38)  | So it's also a range and accepts ints.                                                              |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=917.72)  | And so something like at media color index is greater than or equal to one or at media              |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=922.3)   | min color index is 256.                                                                             |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=924.52)  | There's no Firefox support for color index though.                                                  |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=927.16)  | We also have monochrome, so this is another color display, a media query feature, and               |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=931.52)  | it's the, does device have monochrome?                                                              |
| [15:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=933.8)   | Is it in monochrome or not?                                                                         |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=934.96)  | And it accepts a range.                                                                             |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=935.96)  | So you can be monochrome greater than two.                                                          |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=937.92)  | So maybe like a sepia type effect, there's no IE, but otherwise good support on this                |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=941.96)  | feature query.                                                                                      |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=942.96)  | There's color gamut, which describes the approximate range of color supported by the output device. |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=947.78)  | These values currently are sRGB, P3 and rec 2020.                                                   |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=951.62)  | These are discreet.                                                                                 |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=952.62)  | These are not arranged.                                                                             |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=953.62)  | So you can't check for a min or a max.                                                              |
| [15:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=954.72)  | You can only check for explicit values and it matches if that device can use that gamut             |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=958.92)  | or more.                                                                                            |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=959.92)  | So this would be like at media open parentheses color dash gamut, colon P3 and parentheses          |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=965.5)   | or not color gamut.                                                                                 |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=967.34)  | You can check just to see if it's at sRGB.                                                          |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=969.88)  | There's no Firefox support, but it is in Safari tech preview and you can find it in chromium        |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=974.36)  | that's color gamut.                                                                                 |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=975.6)   | And that's in the chromium dev tools.                                                               |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=977.3)   | You can emulate the different color gamuts and test your pages based on these different             |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=982.2)   | color gamut potentials.                                                                             |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=983.44)  | The next one is forced colors and this matches when prefers contrast forced matches.                |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=987.84)  | This is also discreet.                                                                              |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=988.92)  | So forced colors is either active or not.                                                           |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=991.32)  | And it's in edge behind a flag in Firefox and chromium and forced colors comes into                 |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=996.1)   | play in a few different ways.                                                                       |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=998.6)   | But yeah, we'll go over that in the next prefers episode.                                           |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1001.1)  | There's also inverted colors.                                                                       |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1002.2)  | So this indicates whether the content is being displayed normally or inverted, right?               |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1005.72) | This is also discreet and that it's either none or inverted and you can do at media inverted        |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1009.86) | colors and that will tell you a Boolean.                                                            |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1011.74) | It's true or false.                                                                                 |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1012.74) | It's inverted or not.                                                                               |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1014.16) | It's currently Safari only.                                                                         |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1015.84) | And the last one is also Safari only which I've used in a few demos because it's really             |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1019.46) | fun is called dynamic range and this represents the combination of max brightness, color depth      |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1024.82) | and color contrast ratios that are supported in the output device.                                  |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1029.32) | Basically can it make deeper blacks, brighter whites and more vibrant colors?                       |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1034.2)  | So this is dynamic range and it's discreet in the values it accepts as high or standard.            |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1039.48) | Is this a standard display or is this a dynamic range display to the blacks get real black          |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1044.28) | into the whites get real bright white and you can check for that with at media open                 |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1048.68) | parentheses dynamic dash range colon high and parentheses again, Safari only.                       |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1053.32) | Wow, there's a lot that you can do with querying color and there's a lot of interesting work        |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1058.44) | happening in the color space right now, so it'll be good to have these.                             |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1062.24) | There's lots more.                                                                                  |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1063.24) | Next we have the interaction query.                                                                 |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1065.76) | So the first one is hover.                                                                          |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1067.18) | This tests if the primary input mechanism allows the user to hover over elements.                   |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1071.96) | The values here are either none or hover, so it's also a binary and you could, as I                 |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1076.84) | was mentioning at the top of the show, right?                                                       |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1078.3)  | This is at media hover colon hover or just at media hover and get the resolution for                |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1083.64) | that.                                                                                               |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1084.64) | So not only is there hover, but there's also any hover and this tests whether any available         |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1088.64) | input mechanism can hover over elements.                                                            |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1091.32) | So the way that I think of this is like you could have a mobile device that uses an optional        |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1095.32) | like pencil tool that might have hovering capabilities, so you can't just set a binary              |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1100.16) | hover or not.                                                                                       |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1101.48) | You might need any hover, so you'd write at media and then in parentheses any dash hover            |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1106.4)  | with you know colon hover or none.                                                                  |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1109.52) | So similarly to those is pointer.                                                                   |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1112.32) | Pointer tests whether the user has a pointing device such as a mouse and its accuracy.              |
| [18:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1116.7)  | So it's not just a binary yes or no.                                                                |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1118.76) | You also get values of course and fine.                                                             |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1121.34) | So all the values are none, course or fine.                                                         |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1124.28) | For example, if you have a course pointer or none as the value here, you might want                 |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1128.8)  | to have bigger inputs like check boxes and buttons than you otherwise would have if there           |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1132.96) | is a fine pointer device.                                                                           |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1135.28) | With any pointer, that's also similar to any hover where it tests for any available mechanism,      |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1141.02) | but now with pointer devices instead of hover.                                                      |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1144.1)  | And an example here might be also like a tablet that has an optional external mouse they could      |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1148.56) | plug in and use with it.                                                                            |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1150.98) | So then we have scripting media queries and this one has no support in browsers, but I              |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1155.24) | wanted to mention it because I thought it was interesting and unique from any other                 |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1159.18) | media query in that it detects whether scripting like JavaScript is available.                      |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1164.16) | And this would essentially be a way to do JavaScript detection CSS rather than just                 |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1168.6)  | JavaScript, which is an interesting thought to me.                                                  |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1172.96) | So I thought that this would be a unique one to throw in here.                                      |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1176.92) | I like that one too, because what I have to do now is the reverse of what my brain wants            |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1181.96) | to do, which is I have to assume there's no JS.                                                     |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1184.68) | I put a class on my body that says no JS, and then that's where I put my styles for                 |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1189.12) | this.                                                                                               |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1191.2)  | And then on page load, I have a JavaScript file that says, hey, look, I'm running, go               |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1195.64) | to remove that class.                                                                               |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1196.64) | And it goes and removes the class.                                                                  |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1198.92) | It'd be really nice to have a media query that did that.                                            |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1200.96) | Okay, so at the end of all this, that was pretty much the recap of all the feature queries.         |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1205.32) | I wanted to make a mention on units, because when you pass a length unit inside of a media          |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1209.6)  | query, if it's a relative unit like 50m, what does it resolve against?                              |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1214.12) | Where does m come from?                                                                             |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1215.78) | And if I'm using viewport units, anyway, I just thought it was important.                           |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1219.2)  | If you're doing app media width is less than 50m, your relative units are calculated against        |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1224.12) | the initial value.                                                                                  |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1225.12) | So that's going to be document root.                                                                |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1226.6)  | So it's just kind of a fun little tidbit that all those units are going to pivot off a root.        |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1230.76) | And that's it.                                                                                      |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1231.76) | Yeah, that's all we have today.                                                                     |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1232.76) | I mean, we did go through a lot of different media queries and app media features and types         |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1239.08) | and just even like understand the vernacular and difference between those two, I think              |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SpJgBhxIGsIBKvvhtnjr1?&t=1242.4)  | is super helpful in CSS land.                                                                       |
