| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.        |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=16.84)   | Today, we're actually talking about z-index.                                                    |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=19.68)   | What a concept!                                                                                 |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=20.84)   | And we're also going to be going over stacking context, which is a pretty in-depth topic,       |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=25.84)   | but it's something that we see all the time and it can definitely bite you if you aren't        |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=30.0)    | aware of what's going on.                                                                       |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=31.46)   | It's an in-depth topic.                                                                         |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=33.08)   | Was that a play on words on purpose or on accident?                                             |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=35.92)   | Depth.                                                                                          |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=36.92)   | Wow, that was a good pun that I didn't intend, but I'll take it.                                |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=40.4)    | Yes, today we are talking about z-index finally, right?                                         |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=43.84)   | Yeah, we introduce it all the time.                                                             |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=45.64)   | It's going to help us answer the question of why isn't my element in front?                     |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=49.44)   | Or hey, I swear this should be working, you know, because that happens all the time with        |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=53.4)    | z-index.                                                                                        |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=54.4)    | So it's a frequent part of application development and design.                                  |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=57.96)   | And I know you've been asked to slap it on there or put it on top.                              |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=61.6)    | And you know, maybe the phrase is easy to say, but it can be really hard or impossible          |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=65.36)   | to deliver that.                                                                                |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=66.36)   | I remember in an Angular 1 application, we were like, a modal?                                  |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=68.64)   | How does that fit into our architecture?                                                        |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=70.68)   | Anyway, we just want to put stuff in front or behind of other stuff, right?                     |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=74.48)   | Well, we're here to help you get that done.                                                     |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=76.48)   | The first way in CSS.                                                                           |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=78.22)   | So this is like no z-index.                                                                     |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=80.44)   | What's in front of what?                                                                        |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=81.44)   | Natural ordering of just like the DOM.                                                          |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=84.34)   | So you haven't done anything.                                                                   |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=85.68)   | Who's in front of who?                                                                          |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=86.68)   | Right?                                                                                          |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=87.68)   | Like, let's say you have a list of items.                                                       |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=89.36)   | Which one is on top?                                                                            |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=90.36)   | Like if you stacked them?                                                                       |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=91.36)   | Well, it turns out the last one in is the one that's in front.                                  |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=95.36)   | So the last child is in front, or like the last child is on top, almost like they're            |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=100.22)  | piling in on top of each other.                                                                 |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=102.42)  | This is useful to know for like floats, where you have something floating on something else.    |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=106.6)   | Or you have CSS grids where you're assigning multiple items into the same area, right?          |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=111.52)  | So those would naturally start to stack and they're going to stack based on the natural         |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=114.62)  | DOM order that occurs.                                                                          |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=115.94)  | So pop quiz, does reversing the order, you know, like flexbox row reverse, does that            |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=121.46)  | change the natural stacking order?                                                              |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=123.52)  | No, it doesn't.                                                                                 |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=124.8)   | It does not.                                                                                    |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=125.8)   | The only thing that flexbox order changes is the visual appearance in terms of first            |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=130.96)  | to last.                                                                                        |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=131.96)  | Yep.                                                                                            |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=132.96)  | Nailed it.                                                                                      |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=133.96)  | So that was just a fun one to throw in there to see if it, you know, twisted your brain         |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=136.12)  | a little bit.                                                                                   |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=137.12)  | But not Yuna, she's on top of it.                                                               |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=138.32)  | I didn't know if you're asking me or the audience.                                              |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=140.52)  | I was kind of asking.                                                                           |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=142.08)  | Yeah, I hadn't prepped you.                                                                     |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=143.52)  | So I was like, I hope she gets it right.                                                        |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=145.32)  | Yeah, it was a real pop quiz.                                                                   |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=146.72)  | It was kind of for the audience too, I guess.                                                   |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=148.32)  | Anyway, okay.                                                                                   |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=149.32)  | So then next in here, I have my favorite inflow stacking trick is with CSS grid.                |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=153.88)  | I really, really love this assigning multiple children to the same grid area and watch them     |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=158.84)  | stack and fit.                                                                                  |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=160.12)  | I feel like I'm stacking and items are still in flow.                                           |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=163.12)  | It's just like this rare thing.                                                                 |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=164.76)  | Anyway, Zindex is our primary way to change this natural order.                                 |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=168.28)  | So if you're upset with that natural order, or you want to be explicit, or you want to          |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=171.4)   | do some interactions, we have Zindex.                                                           |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=174.04)  | And Yuna, what is Zindex and how do we use it?                                                  |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=176.88)  | Zindex explicitly sets layer order.                                                             |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=179.78)  | So it takes a numeric value.                                                                    |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=181.2)   | It could be positive or negative.                                                               |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=183.0)   | And Zindex refers to the Z axis.                                                                |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=185.68)  | So in the three dimensional space of a browser, you can remember it this way, X moves items     |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=191.24)  | horizontally, Y moves items vertically, so that's up and down.                                  |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=195.02)  | And then Z moves items forward towards you and backwards away from you.                         |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=199.98)  | So you'd be able to see this more clearly if you rotate your browser to the side, or            |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=204.56)  | if you use those Zindex values in a way that you then are combining with a transform.           |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=210.5)   | So if you're transforming something using a rotation, you'll be able to see a Zindex            |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=215.02)  | of the children within the parent that you're rotating.                                         |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=218.04)  | And you'll see that those Zindex values are popping forward or backwards.                       |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=221.92)  | And you need to have a position other than static set on any element for any specified          |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=228.24)  | Zindex to work.                                                                                 |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=230.08)  | This is the key here.                                                                           |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=231.94)  | If you're having trouble with Zindex, this is probably the number one reason your Zindex        |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=236.84)  | is not working, is that you don't have a position, like position relative with the              |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=240.84)  | Zindex.                                                                                         |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=241.84)  | This property does not work on its own.                                                         |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=243.16)  | It needs a position to make Zindex have some context.                                           |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=247.2)   | And so that is why your Zindex isn't working.                                                   |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=250.32)  | You don't have a position.                                                                      |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=251.32)  | It's that simple.                                                                               |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=252.32)  | Well, it's not simple.                                                                          |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=253.32)  | It's the thing to remember.                                                                     |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=254.32)  | It's the thing.                                                                                 |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=255.32)  | It's like additional cognitive overhead.                                                        |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=257.12)  | So Zindex values, you can have the value of zero, but zero is really auto or the default        |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=264.04)  | value for Zindex.                                                                               |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=266.16)  | If you have a Zindex of one or more, well, if it's more than one, it's going to appear          |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=271.6)   | in front of other elements in the specified order.                                              |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=274.76)  | So if you have like one and the index of two, and then three, two is going to be on top         |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=278.76)  | of one, it's going to be on top of three, depending on how they appear with their parents.      |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=283.56)  | We'll get into that in a second.                                                                |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=285.12)  | And if you have a Zindex of negative one, you'll be layering an element behind other            |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=290.8)   | elements.                                                                                       |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=291.8)   | So you could layer even behind the parent element.                                              |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=293.76)  | HTML does have a base Zindex, but you cannot layer behind it.                                   |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=299.76)  | So it does create a stacking context, but you can layer behind bodies.                          |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=303.52)  | That's like a fun fact of web browsers.                                                         |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=307.76)  | We, Adam and I, did a web almanac survey at the end of last year, and we surveyed what          |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=314.56)  | the most popular Zindexes were, and we found that they were one and two, and then ten,          |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=319.04)  | one hundred and a thousand, they went up by like ten degrees.                                   |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=321.64)  | And the highest one that we saw in use was nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine         |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=326.08)  | nine nine nine with seven hundred and eighty nines.                                             |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=329.8)   | And if that wasn't enough, it also had an important at the end of it.                           |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=335.44)  | So that was cool to see.                                                                        |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=336.8)   | That was an actual value on somebody's website.                                                 |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=339.16)  | But that number is actually way too high for the browser to actually compute.                   |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=343.84)  | While CSS doesn't limit Zindex numeric size, the highest actual Zindex that a browser can       |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=349.6)   | compute is around two billion, or two billion one hundred forty seven million four hundred      |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=353.68)  | eighty three thousand six hundred and forty seven.                                              |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=355.88)  | And that's because of the limited bit storage in browsers which are typically 32 bit.           |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=360.16)  | That's a little fun fact that Adam definitely wanted us to include in the show.                 |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=363.72)  | I thought it was really fun, too.                                                               |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=366.08)  | Also fun fact of the wealth Almanac survey is the average number of Zindices per site           |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=371.64)  | is 16 on desktop and 17 on mobile, which is a lot.                                              |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=376.96)  | But some sites had more than 60.                                                                |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=378.92)  | So if you have a lot of Zindexes and they're getting hard to manage, a optimization that        |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=385.32)  | we recommend is giving them variable names.                                                     |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=388.48)  | So this could be either through CSS custom properties or if you're using SAS, you could         |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=392.8)   | use SAS variables, but giving your Zindices set variable names like base or modal, which        |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=399.92)  | would be on top of everything else, maybe be like a Zindex of four.                             |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=403.96)  | Like have a few Zindices.                                                                       |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=405.84)  | So maybe like a negative one zero one two and then use those names, you know, background.       |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=413.28)  | You can use that to have like a image behind some div if you want to have like a border         |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=418.2)   | visible but not the whole image visible.                                                        |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=420.46)  | And then again, I mentioned modal, there's base.                                                |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=423.2)   | This is a way to prevent a Zindex hell and just guessing what number to use and just            |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=429.04)  | adding more nines to the end of the Zindex to try to make it work.                              |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=432.84)  | Yeah, I've been there before just like, I'll try the next major number and the next major       |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=438.12)  | number and see if I can get there.                                                              |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=440.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                           |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=441.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                           |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=442.56)  | Zindex guessing is definitely a thing.                                                          |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=443.56)  | So we have a couple of notes here about debugging and inspecting Zindex and things that can     |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=446.72)  | help you kind of figure out what's going on in there.                                           |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=448.76)  | And one of them is the layers panel in DevTools.                                                |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=451.36)  | And you can find it by hitting the more snow.                                                   |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=453.24)  | I call it a snowman icon, but it's the three vertical dots in the top right of the DevTools.    |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=458.04)  | And you can go to show more tools and there's one in there called layers and the layers         |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=461.56)  | tool will let you sort of rotate the webpage in 3D space and then see the stacking, see         |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=466.92)  | the depth.                                                                                      |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=468.14)  | It's really neat and it can be really helpful or it can be really confusing because it's        |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=471.5)   | in 3D space and you have to get your 3D controls ready.                                         |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=475.12)  | There's also a VisBug plugin that can help you do this.                                         |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=477.76)  | So VisBug is this design extension that I've been working on and it can run on any page         |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=482.34)  | and the Zindex tool essentially goes and finds any Zindex that's not zero or auto and shows     |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=488.92)  | you what it is.                                                                                 |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=489.92)  | It'll put a border around the element and tell you the Zindex value of it.                      |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=493.2)   | There's also a couple other debug features in VisBug for Zindex and one of them is color        |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=498.0)   | coding.                                                                                         |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=499.0)   | So you can deploy this color coding feature that will show all elements that have the           |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=503.0)   | same parent will have the same border.                                                          |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=504.96)  | And then there's even another one called pesticide which will put box shadows on anything with  |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=508.84)  | Zindex so you can kind of see the depth of what's going on inside of your page very visually.   |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=513.92)  | It can be kind of handy but I'm with you 100% on just give your Zindex some custom property     |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=519.36)  | names and it can make it way easier.                                                            |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=521.78)  | Like VisBug has this as well because there's multiple layers of information I have to show      |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=525.64)  | over a page and they started to compete, right?                                                 |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=528.16)  | And so now I'm managing like 998 and 997.                                                       |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=531.88)  | Those aren't my real values but that's how close some of those were, right?                     |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=535.32)  | So I did.                                                                                       |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=536.32)  | I went and I named them and I was like this is glass layer visual border overlays.              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=540.14)  | So this would be like all the boxes that I draw.                                                |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=542.12)  | And there's labels.                                                                             |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=543.12)  | So that's the glass layer for labels because labels always need to be on top of boxes.          |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=547.0)   | Anyway, so I created this little system of glass layers and then each custom element            |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=551.5)   | gets assigned to a layer of glass.                                                              |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=552.96)  | And now I don't have to worry about if it's Zindex 1 billion or whatever.                       |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=557.22)  | It's just it's got this nice handy layer name.                                                  |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=559.98)  | So anyway, hot tip, you know, that's really good one.                                           |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=563.08)  | I have a note here too about Zindex and possibilities.                                          |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=565.84)  | So there's things that you can't do in CSS with Zindex.                                         |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=570.4)   | So there's times like I mentioned earlier on, there might be a scenario where you literally     |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=573.68)  | can't be on top of the other item.                                                              |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=576.14)  | And that's because of what we'll get into here next is called stacking contexts.                |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=580.24)  | And there's one cool exception to stacking contexts and that's the select element.              |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=584.68)  | At least this is my favorite cool exception.                                                    |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=586.96)  | The select element, no matter where it is, no matter how nested it is in your DOM, it           |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=590.8)   | can always pop out and be on top.                                                               |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=593.2)   | And I think that's kind of interesting.                                                         |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=594.8)   | It's really hard for like Ionic, for example, to come up with a component that can do that      |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=599.52)  | because that means their component has to live at the global level.                             |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=602.62)  | They have to append and remove that element from the root of the whole document in order        |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=606.74)  | to simulate what the select element does for free, super duper nested.                          |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=610.6)   | Anyway, kind of a cool aside, but let's dig into stacking contexts and why I need to know       |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=615.8)   | what those are and stuff like that.                                                             |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=617.68)  | You know, can you break us down like what's a stacking context?                                 |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=620.04)  | Yeah, but before we get into it, like that's really interesting about the select.               |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=623.76)  | So what you're saying is when you have it open, even if you have something with a Z             |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=627.56)  | index of like 2 billion, it's still going to be on top of it.                                   |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=631.04)  | But what about dialogues?                                                                       |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=632.36)  | Because those are pop ups that should theoretically be even on top of the select, right?        |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=637.18)  | That should always be the top most level.                                                       |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=639.72)  | I would imagine a select, like if you open a select and it's got the dropdown showing,          |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=644.6)   | I estimate that dropdown would show over top of a dialogue element.                             |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=648.8)   | Interesting.                                                                                    |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=649.8)   | Because if you want, you could have a select inside of a dialogue, right?                       |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=652.08)  | But then that, yeah, let's see.                                                                 |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=653.64)  | Well hopefully it would remove the focus when you were no longer focused inside the select.     |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=657.28)  | That shouldn't be a problem really.                                                             |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=659.0)   | But that's such an interesting, fun fact.                                                       |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=660.84)  | I did not know.                                                                                 |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=661.84)  | I'm glad.                                                                                       |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=662.84)  | Yes, back to stacking context.                                                                  |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=665.6)   | So Z index can create stacking context.                                                         |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=668.28)  | What is stacking context?                                                                       |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=669.84)  | Stacking context is a group of elements with a common parent that move forward or backward      |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=674.88)  | together in the stacking order, and that's what's known as stacking context.                    |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=678.22)  | So there's a stacking order, they move forward and backwards, they're composited together.      |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=682.74)  | So this stacking context cannot be escaped by its children once it's established on the         |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=688.12)  | parent.                                                                                         |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=689.12)  | So if you have a child element, say you have like a button inside of a div, and that button     |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=694.64)  | has a Z index of 9000, and then you have a sibling element next to that div, so say you         |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=701.84)  | have like a link next to it, I don't know why I'm giving these examples as the examples,        |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=705.88)  | but say that link has a Z index of 2, that button with the Z index of 9000 is going to          |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=710.84)  | be behind that secondary sibling element if they're physically on top of each other in          |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=716.0)   | that layout.                                                                                    |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=717.0)   | Yep.                                                                                            |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=718.0)   | So just be aware that this is contained to a parent, and different parents will have            |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=723.8)   | different stacking contexts.                                                                    |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=725.28)  | Yep.                                                                                            |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=726.28)  | It's sort of related to like a bounding box, you know, like you have to put position relative   |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=730.08)  | on something and then that changes all the children and those children can't escape that        |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=734.44)  | bounding box.                                                                                   |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=735.96)  | Very similar to the stacking context for creating this unescapable organizing system so that    |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=742.52)  | things become easier for you, but yeah, there's some trade-offs in there.                       |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=745.92)  | So let's talk about creating stacking contexts and what does that.                              |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=749.58)  | Like one of them is free, you mentioned it earlier, the HTML element on your page, that         |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=752.92)  | base tag is your first free stacking context.                                                   |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=756.74)  | You can't go behind it, like she said, but you can go behind the body tag and that's            |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=760.22)  | because the body tag hasn't established a new stacking context.                                 |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=764.08)  | In order to do that, so if you want to create one, not just leverage your free one, you         |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=768.04)  | can do that by putting a position other than static on an element and a Z index value that's    |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=772.92)  | not auto.                                                                                       |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=773.92)  | So Una had covered that earlier, that these have to go together and together they create        |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=777.68)  | that stacking context.                                                                          |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=778.68)  | So it could be position absolute, relative, and then you could have a child with some           |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=781.86)  | Z index, but there's also this thing that people do all the time, which I used to do            |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=785.52)  | as well, which is you do a star selector and you inside of there put position relative          |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=790.2)   | and this can be handy because sometimes you want to position a child top and left from          |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=794.5)   | somewhere and then you're like, oh, you have to go up to the parent and set position relative   |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=799.2)   | on it.                                                                                          |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=800.2)   | So some folks just set position relative on everything and while that is not creating           |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=804.2)   | a bunch of stacking contexts, it is creating a lot of containing blocks and you might not       |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=809.64)  | want those containing blocks and so the idea here though is that position relative on its       |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=814.04)  | own does not create the stacking context, it is a potential stacking context, but it            |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=818.88)  | is for sure a containing block.                                                                 |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=820.66)  | So this is the sort of annoyingly weird niche stuff we hope you like on this show is that       |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=825.84)  | position relative creates a containing block and then if there's Z index on it or any of        |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=830.36)  | its children, it is now a stacking context and those are the delineations of our box            |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=835.16)  | world.                                                                                          |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=836.16)  | This is crazy.                                                                                  |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=837.16)  | Yeah, I didn't even know that people did that with the position relative on everything.         |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=840.24)  | Oh, it's like box sizing border box.                                                            |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=841.96)  | It used to be like the first two lines folks would do.                                          |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=844.12)  | Yeah, I do that.                                                                                |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=845.12)  | Oh, you do that one.                                                                            |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=846.12)  | Okay.                                                                                           |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=847.12)  | Yeah.                                                                                           |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=848.12)  | So there are a few other properties that create composited layers and therefore create stacking |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=850.96)  | contexts and those include filters, opacity, transforms, and will change.                       |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=858.24)  | So if these sound familiar, these are also the properties that you would use when working       |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=861.9)   | with CSS animations as one way to ensure smooth 60 frames per second animations.                |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=868.02)  | And the reason that this is happening is because these properties do create composite layers,   |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=872.8)   | they're GPU accelerated or adding will change specifies that you are going to change a CSS      |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=878.92)  | property.                                                                                       |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=879.92)  | So please create a composite layer and GPU accelerate that animation.                           |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=883.76)  | And these have stacking context by enabling these composites.                                   |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=888.54)  | Note that filters are slower to animate because they do take up a lot of GPU resources, but     |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=893.64)  | filters themselves because you are changing the pixels on an entire element, they are           |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=899.92)  | going to create a composite layer and stacking context.                                         |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=902.76)  | Same thing with opacity, you might not realize that opacity is creating this composite layer,   |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=906.56)  | but when you create apply opacity to a parent, all of the children also get an opacity applied  |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=912.24)  | to them.                                                                                        |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=913.24)  | So like any link you have inside of a card or an image inside of a card, if you are decreasing  |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=917.32)  | the opacity on that card, it is creating a stacking context on the element, the card,           |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=922.56)  | any element.                                                                                    |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=923.56)  | Yes, thank you.                                                                                 |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=924.56)  | Composited layers automatically create stacking contexts.                                       |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=927.8)   | So we mentioned stacking contexts can get created by regions, absolute and relative             |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=932.16)  | and paged media, but those are not necessarily composited layers, whereas a composited layers   |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=937.62)  | always stack.                                                                                   |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=938.62)  | Okay, so what is the difference between a composite layer and a stacking context?               |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=941.9)   | It's that every composited layer has the potential or is a stacking context.                    |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=947.0)   | Where not every stacking context is a composited layer.                                         |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=950.28)  | So like a stacking context is a space for layering to occur versus a composited layer,          |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=956.12)  | which is a layer itself being sent to the GPU to be rendered flatly or to be turned             |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=961.2)   | into something flat.                                                                            |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=962.64)  | So they are very related, but hopefully that clears it up for someone out there.                |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=965.8)   | Yeah, so where would you want a stacking context specifically?                                  |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=969.04)  | I remember a classic example being tabs.                                                        |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=972.38)  | So you have like your old school, elementary school tabs would layer on top of each other,      |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=976.86)  | and on the web we wanted to recreate that tab effect.                                           |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=979.08)  | And when you selected, you know, the about me tab, it should come to the front.                 |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=982.92)  | So they'd have this overlapping edges and Z index would be a way for me to bring one            |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=987.4)   | to the front.                                                                                   |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=988.4)   | And so the container of those tabs needed to be a stacking context so the children could        |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=992.62)  | move forward or backward.                                                                       |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=993.62)  | Yeah, that definitely makes sense.                                                              |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=994.62)  | You can also do it for hover.                                                                   |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=995.76)  | Yeah.                                                                                           |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=996.76)  | What about you?                                                                                 |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=997.76)  | Stacking context examples?                                                                      |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=998.76)  | Well, I think of tool tips as a example where you might have a few different bits of content    |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1004.08) | and it should be a context that is layered on top of the page to that same effect modals        |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1010.4)  | and galleries or carousels, especially if you have like a gallery carousel with call            |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1014.4)  | to action items or text in addition to images within it.                                        |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1017.76) | That would definitely make sense to stack in context.                                           |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1019.6)  | I really like how you described it earlier as an organizational mechanism in your web           |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1025.04) | layout.                                                                                         |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1026.04) | I think that's a great way to think about it.                                                   |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1027.04) | Yeah, those are great examples.                                                                 |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1028.36) | Yeah, rich media tends to have like close buttons and play buttons that sort of like            |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1032.96) | overlay media.                                                                                  |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1034.72) | And so those are often scenarios for stacking context, right?                                   |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1037.6)  | Anytime you're overlaying, right?                                                               |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1039.44) | The web is all about flow and z-index is our way to manage layering, which ends up being        |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1045.8)  | kind of hard on the web.                                                                        |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1047.2)  | There's one more technique I wanted to mention of where I've used a stacking context.           |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1051.28) | And this was I was creating a three-dimensional pretty much operating system for a company      |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1056.48) | in Japan.                                                                                       |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1057.48) | And the idea was that your tablet was a viewport, like a window into a bunch of floating cubes. |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1065.04) | And so the assertion was that spatial memory is better than like this flat memory that          |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1071.16) | we work with today.                                                                             |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1072.16) | So like, for example, you go into your room and it's easier for you to find your phone          |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1075.4)  | because you know where your phone is in your room, you walk to it and you go put it there.      |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1079.0)  | So we built a spatial interface with 3D CSS.                                                    |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1083.28) | So we used z-index, we used z-space and we did a lot, a lot of layering to create this          |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1088.04) | effect.                                                                                         |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1089.04) | And what it taught me about stacking contexts is it essentially establishes a window.           |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1095.2)  | You can very much think about that window as something that you can reach into once             |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1098.44) | you've established it.                                                                          |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1099.44) | So a stacking context is this orchestrational moment for you to grab the reins and say,         |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1105.9)  | this is how the depth will work in this box.                                                    |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1109.28) | Anyway, I hope this helped clarify some like things you could do with z-index on the web        |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1114.12) | and where z-index might be failing you and why.                                                 |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1117.52) | And we appreciate you listening.                                                                |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1119.08) | Yeah.                                                                                           |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1120.08) | Remember to add that position with your z-indices.                                              |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1122.24) | And I had a lot of fun on the show.                                                             |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1124.2)  | Thanks for joining us on our journey through z-space.                                           |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1126.52) | I think it'd be really fun to do a future show on like 3D CSS where we could talk about         |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1130.44) | transform origin and all those other things that affect z-index.                                |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1134.56) | And definitely we should do a follow up.                                                        |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Z0fKRilywVPqSNzlk8X97?&t=1136.72) | But yeah, I just want to say thank you all for listening.                                       |
