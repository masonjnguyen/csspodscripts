| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z index.           |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=17.48)  | Today, we're sliding our way into scrolling and snapping. Mostly snapping and snap points          |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=22.86)  | because we covered a lot of scroll topics in the overflow episode. So definitely check             |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=27.88)  | that one out for more on scrolling and how scroll is affected by overflow and containers           |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=33.5)   | and where the scroll bars live and all that good stuff. There's a lot to know about scroll         |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=38.02)  | and flow. But for today, let's get into snapping and start with the snap parent. The snap parent   |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=46.76)  | is the scroll port plus the snap port. So when a box has its overflow set, it becomes              |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=53.92)  | a scroll port. You can think of it like a window into a surface larger than itself,                |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=59.88)  | able to pan around and reveal the other hidden content. And when that same scroll port adds        |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=65.68)  | a scroll snap type, it becomes a snap port. The snap port is the bounding box and target           |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=72.52)  | area for the rest of the following CSS properties that we're about to discuss. And it's worth      |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=78.2)   | noting that most of the properties we're going to talk about are supported in all modern           |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=83.18)  | major browsers and we'll let you know which ones are not. But let's start with the scroll          |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=87.56)  | snap type, which is the most supportive of all these features.                                     |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=90.24)  | Yeah. And so this goes on the parent of the container, the one with the overflow, excellent        |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=94.12)  | introduction and it says, which direction would you like snapping to happen and what               |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=99.38)  | kind of strictness? So the axes that you can pass are things like X and Y. Those should            |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=104.28) | be pretty common things that you've seen if you've seen snap points, but it also supports          |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=108.48) | logical blocking inline and the fun kicker is both. So you can snap on vertical and horizontal     |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=115.96) | scroll.                                                                                            |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=116.96) | Very cool.                                                                                         |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=117.96) | Super cool. The strictness thing that you pass are values like mandatory and proximity.            |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=124.8)  | Notice that both is accepted and that's because as a value of axes, because it works like          |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=129.96) | a matrix. So you could have a two dimensional grid that's got rows and columns and snap            |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=134.36) | along the columns and snap along the rows, scroll right, scroll left. It's all really              |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=139.12) | awesome. So then you have like the default strictness is proximity of a scroll snap type.          |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=145.68) | And this means that the container might snap on scroll, but it's at the discretion of the          |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=149.96) | user agent to decide if it should or not. Where mandatory means that the container is              |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=153.96) | required to snap if there's a valid place to snap. You can also pass none and say no               |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=159.08) | snapping. So snapping is done for this container.                                                  |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=161.92) | Nice. So next we have scroll padding and this isn't special for scroll snapping. It's really       |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=167.4)  | for any scroll container and it's used for defining the optimal viewing region of a scroll         |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=172.44) | port, like spacing between the edges of the scroll port and the children or offsetting             |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=177.04) | fixed or sticky elements over the scroll port. So if you wanted to scroll snap to another          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=182.76) | region, but keep some of the previous one visible, you could use scroll padding to do              |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=187.52) | so. So you kind of have like the hint that you could go from side to side still. It also           |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=192.12) | helps with padding where the scroll snap would swap. And you can break this property out           |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=198.08) | also into scroll padding top, scroll padding left, scroll padding bottom, right, et cetera.        |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=204.56) | And you can also break it out into its logical values like scroll padding block start, scroll      |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=209.12) | padding inline start, and all of those. And for more on the logical naming for properties          |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=214.92) | that have top right, bottom left, check out our logical properties episode.                        |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=218.16) | Yeah, yeah. Now we have overscroll behavior. Now this isn't exactly a scroll snap feature,         |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=224.52) | but I always use it with my scrolling areas because what it does is when you don't want            |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=230.54) | the overflowing scroll event to chain up into the next scroller. So if you make like a scroller    |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=235.54) | in a scroller and you don't have any overscroll behavior and you just sort of like fling really    |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=240.72) | fast or maybe you scroll up inside of the little container and then all of a sudden                |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=244.34) | you start to scroll the parent container and that's called scroll chaining. And overscroll         |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=248.48) | behavior can trap that and you trap it by setting it to contain. So I usually do something         |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=254.4)  | like overscroll behavior contain, or you can also say overscroll behavior block or overscroll      |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=259.22) | behavior X. This one is not quite supported in Safari, but they do have it as like an              |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=264.8)  | active prototype feature. So that one will be coming across browser quite soon.                    |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=268.28) | Yes, very cool. There's also scroll behavior. Anytime the scroll area is programmatically          |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=274.36) | scrolled from JavaScript or target links, this describes how the scroll happens. So                |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=280.3)  | you can go directly to that area or you can have a nice little ease. And so scroll behavior        |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=285.56) | accepts the values of auto or smooth. And so auto would be just go directly to it and              |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=290.36) | then smooth gives you that nice little ease into that area. So it's a good idea to put             |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=294.64) | scroll behavior smooth behind a prefers reduced motion media query since the whole idea is         |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=298.8)  | to reduce motion that the user isn't directly in control of. And honestly, I just prefer           |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=303.76) | this smooth scroll behavior pretty much always when you're going to a section or deep linking      |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=309.48) | into a section or doing like anchor links within the page, because it just creates a               |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=313.6)  | little bit of a better user experience instead of just popping you into a new section of           |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=318.68) | the page, it scrolls into it and the user can see from where they're moving in this                |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=322.68) | digital space.                                                                                     |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=323.78) | It's so true. These snap points are supposed to be like optimal landing areas, right? There's      |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=329.2)  | like the help alignment and help visibility and you should take someone there gently and           |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=334.48) | smoothly. I totally agree. Excellent tip with the prefers reduced motion also only enable          |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=340.04) | that if it's okay. So that was all snap appearance. So the container, right? This is the thing     |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=345.38) | with overflow. Now we're going to talk about snap children. And what's especially interesting      |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=349.62) | about snap children is that, well, they can be any nested, you know, deep. They don't              |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=355.22) | have to just be the first child. They could be super nested children that say, hey, I              |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=361.0)  | want to snap or make sure my box is snapped inside of the snap port. And any child can             |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=366.96) | specify how they want to be snapped. It could be snapping different than something else.           |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=370.52) | So this kind of gets really complex really quick, especially if you think about like               |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=374.16) | the two directional snap ability of a snap port where it can go left and up and down               |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=380.08) | to snap to different things. Each of those children, each saying how they would like               |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=383.88) | to snap inside of the snap port. Super cool stuff. It can be really simple though at first,        |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=389.16) | which is just like make your headers snap to the thing. Anyway, okay. I'm talking too              |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=392.06) | much about snap children. Let's talk about a property called scroll snap align. And this           |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=397.52) | is what you would put on a child of a snap port that you want to be a potential resting            |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=401.12) | target for optimal viewing. So this is the browser getting a hint that this should be              |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=406.36) | aligned. It accepts none, start, end, and center. Notice those are all pretty much logical         |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=412.24) | property values. And if only one parameter is passed, it's repeated for both axes. Otherwise       |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=417.6)  | it takes two parameters and it starts with not the horizontal axis first. I was really             |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=423.16) | surprised here. I was like, oh, it takes two. Okay. So I'll do horizontal then. Oh, nope,          |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=426.68) | I won't. I'll do block and then inline. So, you know, that kind of makes sense for scrolling       |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=432.84) | because scrolling the natural direction that you're used to scrolling is vertically in             |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=436.6)  | the block direction. Totally. Yep. I agree. Once I thought about it as well, I was like,           |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=440.52) | oh, okay, well that makes sense. So yeah, that's scroll snap align. That goes on the               |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=444.48) | child to say how it would like to align in the snap port. So next we have scroll snap              |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=448.72) | stop. And this specifies if the user can fling over many items or if a certain element should      |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=454.32) | stop that fling from passing it, kind of like putting brakes on like a scroll or snapping          |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=460.4)  | between points. So if the snap children fill the viewport and the scroll area, then specifying     |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=465.48) | scroll snap stop always on each child would mean that the scroller snaps one by one, kind          |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=470.8)  | of like a carousel might. Or when a user flings the items to scroll, imagine like on a mobile      |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=475.96) | phone is kind of flinging over and over, then it'll stop at each item instead of flinging          |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=480.92) | through the entire list. So it'll kind of be like fling stop, fling stop. So scroll                |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=486.02) | snap stop accepts normal and always as values where elements with always attempt to trap           |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=493.12) | the scroll and force a stop. This is supported in Chromium 79 plus, so it's in Chrome and          |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=498.68) | Edge, but it is not currently supported in Firefox and Safari. Yep. Nice breakdown. And            |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=502.96) | it's fun to note. Yeah, like just like snap align, any child can have these properties             |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=506.96) | on them. So you could have different children are snap stop elements. It's like, oh, you           |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=512.08) | can fling pass these five. But once you get to the next category, you know, we're going            |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=515.32) | to stop you at the next category or something. So much cool potential. Let's talk about this       |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=520.76) | last one for snap children. This is scroll margin. So you covered scroll padding, which            |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=525.88) | is on the parent container on the snap port and scroll margin goes on the children and             |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=530.72) | it accepts links for all sides, just like the margin property. But these values will               |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=534.68) | be added to the elements box size when it's scroll positions are being computed. So like           |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=539.36) | a classic example of this is that there's a target and when it's scrolled to to like               |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=544.14) | an anchor link, the margin can account for extra space so that the header doesn't stick            |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=548.48) | directly to the top of the browser. So often you'll click a link that goes to a header             |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=552.68) | and if that header does not have scroll margin, the header sticks to the very top of the browser   |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=556.96) | position zero and you could give it some scroll margin and say, no, when you're calculating        |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=561.92) | where to optimally scroll to me, here is an offset and that's scroll margin.                       |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=566.4)  | Nice. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to include that when you're specifying a scroll and this     |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=571.28) | stuff is really useful for when you're doing things like any kind of product carousel,             |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=576.92) | any kind of like card list that's horizontal. Honestly, just anywhere that you're scrolling        |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=582.24) | on a page or changing areas of content, being able to control how things scrolls and snaps         |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=588.68) | makes your app like chef's kiss, like gives it that professional touch and with things             |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=594.56) | like carousels or product carousels, which are different but similar. This is just something       |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=602.0)  | that you'll very much likely use. So this kind of brings us to a little bit of a wrap              |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=607.6)  | up and as we wrap, we wanted to point out some extra little tips, tools and supporting             |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=612.0)  | features for snapping and Adam's been doing a ton of scroll snap work lately. So Adam,             |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=617.4)  | do you want to cover some of the things that you've discovered recently along the way?             |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=621.0)  | Yes, I do. One of the first ones is called snap after layout and this is especially important      |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=627.4)  | for things like a slideshow where you've, you know, scrolled to item number five. But              |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=632.76) | let's say you rotate your device to get a better look at the picture. Most browsers                |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=636.88) | today would just restore a scroll position as like an estimate, whereas snap after layout          |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=642.56) | is knowledgeable of the snapped item before layout and as layout happens again, it makes           |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=648.64) | sure that that same snapped child is still snapped appropriately in the snap port. It's            |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=653.44) | really cool. It has even cooler effects in that like you can shrink of a viewport and              |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=662.6)  | the scroll snapped item will try to stay in view even as it's responsively laying out              |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=668.68) | as a new thing. I don't know, so hard to explain.                                                  |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=670.76) | Wait, so where would you use this? Yeah, I've got it in a couple of demos. So                      |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=674.84) | I have one in my slides demo. So I have like a slides framework that I use that uses scroll        |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=679.04) | snap points and I use that to maintain your position. So you resize the window, you do             |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=683.34) | anything to the browser window and it keeps that slide in view.                                    |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=686.72) | Nice. Another one that I have is my tabs component.                                                |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=689.5)  | The top tabs are scrollable like material on Android or iOS where you can scroll the               |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=694.32) | top tabs. And what's kind of cool is if the tab is snapped, right, I snapped to those              |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=699.72) | different tab items and then I resize my browser or I rotate my device, it will keep that tab      |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=706.4)  | that was selected in view. So it won't scroll out of view, it stays snapped.                       |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=711.72) | So it makes it a more app like experience. Yes, it's snapped for all changes that happen           |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=719.84) | to the page. It's like nothing will disrupt the snap whereas previously it could be disrupted      |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=724.68) | or it would lose its snap position. And this is like, no, it's snapped. We're going to             |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=728.24) | keep it snapped through all these different turbulences that come to your webpage or whatever.     |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=733.72) | And yeah, I find it's really valuable to have that feature.                                        |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=736.84) | Nice. We also have new dev tools. They're for this                                                 |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=741.54) | exact thing. They're called scroll snap dev tools. And when you're in the elements panel,          |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=746.24) | you'll see a little badge just like the grid badge show up over top an element that has            |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=750.68) | this. You click it, you'll get a scroll port overlay or a snap port overlay. Each child            |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=756.44) | will get a little bounding box and it'll show you where it snaps to. So you get all of this        |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=761.96) | information visually and as you're scrolling and snapping, you can see why and where it's          |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=765.88) | stopping. And I think the most important here part is that the scroll padding and scroll           |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=770.14) | margin is visualized. So if you have those things, those used to be like invisible somethings.     |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=774.96) | You're like, is it applying? I don't know if it's applying. And now you can see it.                |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=779.48) | And that's really nice. Nice. That's awesome.                                                      |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=781.88) | A hot tip for just creating really engaging, unique web experiences is using scroll snap           |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=789.12) | points with grid and gap and then sprinkle in a little bit of scroll timeline. And you             |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=793.88) | have these experiences where grid creates these equal columns. The user can pan to these           |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=799.88) | different columns with a mouse or touch, use gap to sort of put nice space in between all          |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=804.76) | of them. And then scroll timeline lets all of those little pan and scroll interactions             |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=809.0)  | map to some other like nice visual.                                                                |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=812.0)  | Scroll timeline is super cool. It is so cool. It lets you control an element by the scroll         |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=817.8)  | bar as you like scroll up and down the page. There's a ton that you could do with that.            |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=822.84) | And now it's in CSS declaratively. So you don't need to do a bunch of JavaScript to                |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=827.44) | get that kind of interaction. And that speeds up the browser rendering a lot because that          |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=832.76) | like reading the page every single time on every scroll and then applying a style is               |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=837.92) | just a lot, a lot of work. It's very heavy for the browser to do that. So the new primitives       |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=842.76) | in CSS really help with that kind of work.                                                         |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=845.12) | Yeah, it's like JavaScript is chasing scroll. And if you have a scroll timeline, you're            |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=848.96) | like there with it. You're in the club, I guess. And I like that snap points with scroll           |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=854.6)  | timeline kind of create key frames. So there's like these resting points for the animation         |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=859.68) | and you're able to use those resting points to create these really connected looking experiences.  |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=865.54) | They just feel very app like, very native like in the way that they're sort of linked              |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=869.36) | together. Another thing that's fun with scroll snap points is they come with keyboard support.     |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=874.5)  | So they'll snap between items, left and right arrows will snap each one into the snap space,       |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=878.72) | which is really cool. And then a final here is that scroll snap points. I find that anytime        |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=884.2)  | I'm doing something really custom, I've got JavaScript involved and it's using scroll              |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=888.52) | to and scroll into view. So scroll to is good to call on the container and you can say,            |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=894.36) | scroll to some element or scroll this amount and it will find a new snap point. And so             |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=898.44) | JavaScript can sort of like interact with this smart snapping scrolling container and              |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=903.48) | tell it where to go. And then there's also scroll into view, which you can just say,               |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=907.08) | hey, this snap item, scroll it into view and it will smoothly scroll into view and snap            |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=911.58) | to the area. And just, I don't know, there's something really harmonious about this orchestration. |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=917.1)  | And I just really love the effects and the tangibility and the reach that I get in these           |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=922.42) | scroll snap containers. So yep, I'm a scroll snap fan boy. It's okay. I'm proud of it.             |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=926.54) | Anyway.                                                                                            |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=927.54) | It really does add a lot of finesse to your application. So I would definitely encourage           |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=933.28) | anyone who is building carousels or experiences in which you're creating segments of your          |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=939.62) | page, whether that's horizontal or vertical to explore some of these features, use them,           |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=945.48) | try them out because it is scrolling and snapping. It is pretty easy to progressively enhance.     |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=951.62) | So even though it might not be supported on older browsers, most of the modern browsers            |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=955.72) | do support all of these. So definitely give that a shot and check these out. I guess that's        |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02VO53lNDAYj46zIlbeWQx?&t=961.64) | all for today. Thank you so much for joining us.                                                   |
