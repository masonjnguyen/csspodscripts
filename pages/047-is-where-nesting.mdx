| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=16.84)   | Today we're talking about a few various but related topics all within the scope of some            |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=22.56)   | syntactic sugaring, and those are the is and where functions as well as the experimental           |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=28.72)   | CSS spec for nesting.                                                                              |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=31.0)    | The CSS podcast is where it's at.                                                                  |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=36.28)   | That was a really bad joke that sounded cooler when I wrote it down because I used the colons,     |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=41.24)   | but you can't see the colons, can you?                                                             |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=45.36)   | You might be familiar with some of these concepts, for example, nesting from using pre and post    |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=49.68)   | processors and now those very sweet functions may be coming to a native CSS file near you.         |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=56.36)   | I love that this show just got like hella 90s.                                                     |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=59.64)   | We're where it's at.                                                                               |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=60.64)   | It's the name of the functions.                                                                    |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=66.4)    | Yeah colon where it is.                                                                            |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=69.68)   | Functional pseudo class selectors to be exact.                                                     |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=74.72)   | So good.                                                                                           |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=75.72)   | All right.                                                                                         |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=76.72)   | So yes, sugar, the sweet, sweet sugar of is and where and nesting.                                 |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=79.94)   | The sugar being mostly that you get to write less.                                                 |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=82.48)   | So like when you talk about sugar in JavaScript, it's always like, oh, it can do the same thing.   |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=86.12)   | We've always been able to do, but wow, I get to write way less.                                    |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=89.16)   | That seems fun, right?                                                                             |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=90.52)   | Terse and powerful language features.                                                              |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=92.6)    | We like those.                                                                                     |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=93.64)   | And with is the sugar means writing less by not repeating ourselves as much and it's unlocking     |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=98.4)    | nesting.                                                                                           |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=100.04)  | So is was a gateway to us getting full on nesting.                                                 |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=103.04)  | We'll talk about how that works, but the sugar also comes down to two completely new CSS           |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=108.6)   | features.                                                                                          |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=109.72)  | So we'll talk about those and that's forgiving selector lists and specificity squashing.           |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=115.02)  | Say that 10 times fast.                                                                            |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=117.16)  | Specificity squashing, specificity squashing, specificity squashing.                               |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=119.16)  | It's pretty good.                                                                                  |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=120.96)  | I was tempted to.                                                                                  |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=121.96)  | I was like, as soon as I said that, I was like, oh, challenge.                                     |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=124.24)  | I must.                                                                                            |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=125.24)  | I know.                                                                                            |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=126.24)  | I couldn't even say it in my head without mixing it up.                                            |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=128.2)   | So Yuna, tell us about these new functional pseudo class selectors.                                |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=131.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=132.16)  | So let's start with is and where.                                                                  |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=133.96)  | These are both available in Chromium since Chromium 88, Firefox 78 and Safari 14, which            |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=140.16)  | is most modern browsers and a few versions back of them too.                                       |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=143.76)  | So these are functional pseudo class selectors, as we've been saying earlier, which is a mouthful. |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=149.0)   | They're functional because they have the parentheses and they accept arguments.                    |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=152.84)  | They are pseudo classes because of the colon and how they're used and they're selectors            |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=157.6)   | because of where they're used and also what they become.                                           |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=160.84)  | So is and where allow you to specify a whole set of criteria for an element to match.              |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=165.36)  | So you can use them in the same places where you would use something like not, which is            |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=170.16)  | a functional pseudo selector.                                                                      |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=171.88)  | If not, you're matching a base selector with some exceptions.                                      |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=174.84)  | So you could write like p colon not and then in the parentheses dot blue.                          |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=179.12)  | And this would match all paragraphs except for those of the class of blue.                         |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=182.8)   | So is and where are the opposite.                                                                  |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=184.72)  | You're doing specific matching.                                                                    |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=188.12)  | And I think that this works best to explain with examples.                                         |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=191.76)  | These are super useful when you're writing big selectors in a more compact form, as we're          |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=195.8)   | talking about.                                                                                     |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=196.8)   | You can write syntactic sugar over something that you could write in a longer format and           |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=202.04)  | it enables grouping features.                                                                      |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=204.44)  | So I'll use is for these examples.                                                                 |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=206.84)  | Is and where are very similar.                                                                     |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=207.88)  | The difference is around specificity and Adam will get into that.                                  |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=210.88)  | So let's look at some examples.                                                                    |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=212.8)   | You could write something like colon is and then in parentheses dot blue comma dot red             |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=218.24)  | space a.                                                                                           |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=219.6)   | And so here we would have a class called blue, a class called red, and then they're both           |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=224.76)  | within the is and then there's a a right after that.                                               |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=228.28)  | So that would become dot blue space a comma dot red space a, which means that you're targeting     |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=236.22)  | links within a blue class and a red class.                                                         |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=239.2)   | So maybe you want to have an underline for those specific links or make them purple.               |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=244.24)  | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=245.24)  | Both blue and red links get a styling.                                                             |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=248.0)   | Instead of writing them both out with a comma in between, you can write them together.             |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=251.88)  | So let's look at another example.                                                                  |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=253.72)  | Maybe you had dot sidebar colon is and then in parentheses dot blue comma dot red space            |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=258.08)  | a.                                                                                                 |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=259.08)  | So this longhand would be dot sidebar and then space dot blue space a comma dot sidebar            |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=264.84)  | space dot red space a.                                                                             |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=266.68)  | So here now we're targeting within a sidebar.                                                      |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=269.88)  | If you have something with a class of blue or a class of red, the link inside of those.            |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=274.92)  | So now we're getting even longer with how we're writing things, but it's still one line            |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=278.96)  | of code instead of these two longer lines of code.                                                 |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=281.68)  | And it's a lot more condensed.                                                                     |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=283.48)  | You can combine these with other primitives.                                                       |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=287.28)  | If you wanted to use the greater than, you could do a is greater than b is greater than            |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=290.88)  | colon is and then here you could put dot blue comma dot red for the classes.                       |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=294.96)  | And that would become, you have a greater than b greater than dot blue, blah, blah,                |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=300.16)  | a greater than b greater than dot whatever, blah, blah, blah.                                      |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=304.44)  | And so you get these longer things.                                                                |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=308.72)  | And you could also use is not just in the beginning or the end, but together and it                |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=314.08)  | creates combinations of values.                                                                    |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=317.52)  | So you could do colon is and then in parentheses red and blue space colon is yellow green.         |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=323.88)  | So now we're going to create matches.                                                              |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=325.2)   | We're going to do, that is going to become dot red space dot yellow dot red space dot              |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=330.4)   | green dot blue space dot yellow and dot blue space dot green.                                      |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=333.76)  | So it's kind of like, it's funny.                                                                  |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=336.24)  | I'm thinking of like science class where we do like those squares and you would match              |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=340.6)   | like this, the combinations of genes.                                                              |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=343.44)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=344.44)  | It's kind of like that.                                                                            |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=345.76)  | But all this is to say is you can expand a syntax and with is you're matching everything           |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=353.04)  | inside of the parentheses and you're expanding it.                                                 |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=357.68)  | So when you have them right after each other, you have to make all of the pairs of everything      |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=361.24)  | that's within is.                                                                                  |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=362.68)  | And this is actually really useful for things like lists and nested list items.                    |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=367.72)  | And just a lot of the time, like instead of writing long selectors, you could write it             |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=373.28)  | a little bit more shorthand.                                                                       |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=374.28)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=375.28)  | And you've got a phrase on this show, which is every hover has an equal focus and is can           |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=380.68)  | let you simply group those.                                                                        |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=383.16)  | And that makes that really nice and succinct.                                                      |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=385.32)  | And I like your examples.                                                                          |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=386.32)  | You had an example where we grouped at the beginning.                                              |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=388.04)  | You have an example where we grouped at the end, an example where we did grouping in the           |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=391.56)  | middle.                                                                                            |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=392.56)  | And those are sort of it's yeah, I mean, grouping sounds like an easy enough concept to think      |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=397.0)   | about.                                                                                             |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=398.0)   | But yeah, if you're grouping in all those different locations and you can like stack               |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=401.16)  | them together, just like not, it becomes really, really powerful.                                  |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=404.78)  | It also can get really complex and out of hand really quick.                                       |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=407.24)  | So there's things to be worried about there.                                                       |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=409.56)  | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                  |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=410.56)  | Like, Asterisk, don't go too crazy with just like with nesting.                                    |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=413.98)  | There's like a, you know, best practice, quote unquote, like don't go more than three levels       |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=417.28)  | deep.                                                                                              |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=418.28)  | I think the same thing with here.                                                                  |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=419.52)  | You can use this to write things very succinctly, but try not to go too deep because then your     |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=423.64)  | CSS tends to slow down quite a bit.                                                                |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=426.12)  | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=427.12)  | Some of these expand massively beyond what you may have anticipated.                               |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=430.84)  | So yeah, there's some fun examples.                                                                |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=432.34)  | You can go look online.                                                                            |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=433.34)  | You're just like, wow, that was like eight characters and that's that many selectors.              |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=437.32)  | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=438.32)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=439.32)  | So nice breakdown.                                                                                 |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=440.32)  | I think I like the visuals or at least I was visualizing them as you were saying them.             |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=444.68)  | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=445.68)  | So let's talk about what can go in between these parentheses.                                      |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=448.28)  | And this is where we have the topic of forgiving selector list.                                    |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=452.68)  | So actually let's first cover that it can accept complex selectors inside.                         |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=456.16)  | So you could say is foo space bar space, you know, direct descendant article.                      |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=463.2)   | You could write a very complex thing in between those parentheses, just like you can inside        |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=466.76)  | of not.                                                                                            |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=467.76)  | So go ahead, pass the gnarliest thing you can think of into that selector.                         |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=471.44)  | And it can be complex as you need it to be.                                                        |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=473.48)  | And it should all be fine.                                                                         |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=475.06)  | Now where it gets cool is this forgiving selector list concept, because you can put a comma        |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=478.26)  | in there.                                                                                          |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=479.26)  | So you could put a, you know, complex selector, comma, another complex selector, and really        |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=483.04)  | pack is with sort of this like complex grouping of complex selectors.                              |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=488.2)   | And what's really interesting here is this forgiving selector list.                                |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=490.72)  | So when you pass multiple things in there, you're passing a selector list.                         |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=494.44)  | And what forgiving is sort of trying to tell you here is that if one of them fails or one          |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=497.96)  | of them is invalid, not all of them will be thrown away, which is what happens today.              |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=503.32)  | So normally when using a comma between your selectors, if any of them are bad, it'll invalidate    |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=507.3)   | the whole lot of them, but not with isn't where.                                                   |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=509.96)  | So isn't where have this strength, this resilience and this feature of being forgiving, which      |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=516.0)   | is unique and it's brand new.                                                                      |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=518.16)  | It's the only thing so far that CSS has that kind of gives us this feature.                        |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=521.9)   | This becomes like really popular or at least like a concern when you're doing things like          |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=525.88)  | Moz selectors or WebKit selectors.                                                                 |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=529.0)   | And if you try to combine a WebKit selector with a Moz selector with a comma, one or the           |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=533.56)  | other will fail and invalidate the whole thing.                                                    |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=536.58)  | And so you can use is now to get around this.                                                      |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=540.04)  | You can group your potentially cross browser invalid selectors in an is, group all your            |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=545.92)  | styles there together and have the forgiving selector list.                                        |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=548.8)   | It's awesome, right?                                                                               |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=550.32)  | Anyway.                                                                                            |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=551.32)  | Yeah, that's a great use case.                                                                     |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=553.44)  | So far we've talked about how they're syntactically identical where is and where can do the same   |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=558.04)  | thing so they can go into the same places.                                                         |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=560.0)   | They can take the same amount of complex selectors.                                                |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=562.68)  | They're both forgiving, et cetera, but the specificity is different.                               |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=566.46)  | So is takes the highest of its list items as its specificity total where where squashes            |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=573.56)  | everything between the parentheses to a specificity total of zero.                                 |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=578.16)  | Now this is the first time that CSS has the ability to squash specificity.                         |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=582.98)  | We have the star selector, which has no specificity, but this can literally you pass in a selector |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=588.54)  | that could be really specific and it just goes, eh, I'm not going to care.                         |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=592.6)   | I'm just going to go find those items and I'm going to apply the styles and let's look             |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=595.6)   | at my score as if it was zero.                                                                     |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=598.22)  | So really interesting.                                                                             |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=599.22)  | I could see a lot of libraries like shipping with where in there so that it's easier to            |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=603.4)   | override them, right?                                                                              |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=604.4)   | Like with bootstrap, we're constantly fighting the specificity of the library.                     |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=607.76)  | If it was wrapped in a where it would have no specificity.                                         |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=610.42)  | So by default it just makes it easier to override.                                                 |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=613.28)  | I have a note here about a foot gun, which is is so is takes the highest of its list               |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=618.06)  | items.                                                                                             |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=619.06)  | And so if you get a little too excited with your grouping and you group something with             |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=622.84)  | an ID in there, all of those selectors, even if one was like an anchor comma paragraph,            |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=628.48)  | comma ID foo, they all become the same specificity of an idea, which is very powerful.             |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=635.0)   | So you can either use this to your advantage to, you know, overwrite the specificity of            |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=639.32)  | something specificity of something else.                                                           |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=641.26)  | Or in most cases for me, I accidentally did it and I want to take it out.                          |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=645.56)  | So I go and I just kind of use a comma and bring the ID element out of that is selector            |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=649.88)  | so that it's not sort of being associated with the rest.                                           |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=652.04)  | But anyway, just wanted to mention that it takes that high specificity member, which               |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=656.0)   | you could use for good if you wanted to.                                                           |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=657.8)   | But usually it ends up being something I don't want.                                               |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=660.12)  | And I just wanted to share that.                                                                   |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=661.36)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=662.36)  | And I think that this is really key.                                                               |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=663.64)  | This is why there are two different functions for this.                                            |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=666.9)   | I think where is super useful because as Adam mentioned, it removes the specificity of the         |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=672.64)  | values within the where statement, but it doesn't remove the specificity of the parent.            |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=678.48)  | So if you have something like an ID and you have like, I don't know, hash login form,              |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=683.6)   | colon where and then everything within the where you can target very specifically things           |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=688.32)  | you're styling within that login form, but they'll take the specificity of its parent              |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=693.18)  | of the login form.                                                                                 |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=694.36)  | So you're not completely removing the specificity of that element.                                 |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=697.44)  | You're just removing the specificity that you're adding by targeting very specific parts           |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=702.76)  | of that area, that form.                                                                           |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=704.76)  | And you might not always want that with this specifically.                                         |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=708.32)  | So that's why there are two different functions.                                                   |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=710.76)  | You might want that.                                                                               |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=711.76)  | I mean, most of the time when you're writing this out without is you would have the specificity.   |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=716.04)  | So that could be a good way to think about it.                                                     |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=718.52)  | It's like, do you intend to have the specificity of that long form or are you just doing this      |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=725.08)  | to kind of scope your styles to a parent?                                                          |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=728.6)   | And there you would be probably wanting to use where instead.                                      |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=731.8)   | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=732.8)   | So this brings us to at nest at nest.                                                              |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=735.16)  | That's a fun one.                                                                                  |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=736.52)  | This is an experimental CSS property.                                                              |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=738.72)  | So this is not implemented in browsers yet.                                                        |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=740.72)  | It is a spec that Adam actually is working on.                                                     |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=744.36)  | And yeah, there's definitely some things that might change, but what's cool about at nest          |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=750.64)  | is that it is enabled because of is, and this is syntactic sugar that allows us to nest.           |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=756.66)  | So why, how is this enabled by is?                                                                 |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=759.44)  | Well nesting is the same as building selector groups in the beginning, middle and end with         |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=765.04)  | multiple things chained as we kind of went over what the examples of how to use is.                |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=769.26)  | You can write anything that's nested as long as it's a selector chain.                             |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=773.32)  | So for example, if you have a paragraph with the nested link, that would just be like P            |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=778.4)   | space A. So you could write that nested as like, you know, P and then you have your curly          |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=785.12)  | braces and then some styles and you have A and then curly braces and then some styles.             |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=788.78)  | So it's the same thing because it would be pulled to that top level.                               |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=793.08)  | If you have an ampersand, we'll get into this a little bit more detail later, but if you           |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=796.96)  | have something like a P curlies and then some styles and then ampersand.blue, that's the           |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=802.48)  | inside of it, that is the same as P.blue.                                                          |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=805.54)  | So a paragraph with the class of blue.                                                             |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=808.3)   | If you have a paragraph with a nested thing that you could nest even further, you could            |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=813.8)   | P, but then nested within that is A and nested within that is an ampersand.blue.                   |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=819.98)  | That would be P A.blue.                                                                            |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=821.2)   | So it's a paragraph with a link that has a class of blue.                                          |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=824.48)  | So you can start to see how nesting is syntactic sugar and so is using is.                         |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=830.0)   | And yeah, as I mentioned, we'll get into a little bit of more complex examples, but it             |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=834.84)  | is just a little bit of a nicer way to group our styles and to write them.                         |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=839.52)  | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=840.52)  | And there's currently no sugar for where.                                                          |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=842.52)  | So when you use the at nest spec or use the native CSS nesting with and or the at nest             |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=847.6)   | keyword, you're always going to be unpacking that into an is selector.                             |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=853.34)  | It can't be turned into a where selector, but I'll give you a tip towards the end on               |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=856.86)  | how to use where with nesting.                                                                     |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=858.8)   | The other kind of really nice part here about piggybacking on top of is is that we still           |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=863.92)  | get that forgiveness, right?                                                                       |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=865.36)  | We inherited forgiveness and that was just a fun sentence to say.                                  |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=868.78)  | We inherited forgiveness.                                                                          |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=869.78)  | It sounds so abstract and cool, but anyway, it's just like nesting.                                |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=873.72)  | You can pass right with a comma.                                                                   |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=875.18)  | You can nest multiple things in one line, and if you wrote one wrong, it's not going               |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=879.16)  | to break the whole thing, which is what you'd hope.                                                |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=881.76)  | And you get that because of the feature of is and nesting just kind of gets that for               |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=886.24)  | free.                                                                                              |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=887.24)  | So try to be a huge bummer if nesting allowed creating broken convenience.                         |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=890.56)  | That just would not be very convenient.                                                            |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=892.36)  | We don't want to take the whole nesting ship down with one little issue, but we don't.             |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=896.64)  | So that's what's nice.                                                                             |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=897.64)  | CSS won't do that to you.                                                                          |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=898.64)  | We have forgiving selector lists even with our nests.                                              |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=901.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=902.48)  | And another feature of nesting is ampersand.                                                       |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=904.4)   | This is something that you are likely familiar with if you use something like SAS or another       |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=907.72)  | preprocessor for nesting.                                                                          |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=910.4)   | And that allows you to create a continuation of a selector into a new selector.                    |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=915.16)  | So if you're nesting typically without the ampersand, it would be like creating a space            |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=920.6)   | between the parent and the nested child.                                                           |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=922.98)  | So if you had, I don't know, I gave the example earlier of like P and then a link within the       |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=929.2)   | paragraph.                                                                                         |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=930.56)  | So if you didn't have any ampersand or thing between them, that would just be PSPACE A.            |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=936.68)  | If you use the ampersand, you kind of like suck it so it like connects in a way.                   |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=942.1)   | And so you could use the ampersand with other structures like the greater than or the curly        |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=947.88)  | or with a class that you could attach like an ID.                                                  |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=951.8)   | So if you imagine this example, say you have a card, within a card class, you have some            |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=957.4)   | styles like background white, padding, one rem.                                                    |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=960.2)   | And within that, you're styling a header.                                                          |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=962.32)  | You could do dot card and then you could either just do H1 and that would be dot card dot          |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=967.24)  | H1.                                                                                                |
| [16:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=968.24)  | But if you want to be more specific and have a direct descendant of the card be what you're        |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=971.44)  | accessing, you would do ampersand greater than H1.                                                 |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=976.12)  | And that would then compute into dot card greater than H1.                                         |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=981.4)   | And that is a direct descendant selector.                                                          |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=985.24)  | So that means that the direct descendant H1 of card would get that style.                          |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=989.0)   | So if you had another H1 within the card, within some other div within the card, it                |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=993.36)  | wouldn't get that style.                                                                           |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=994.76)  | And you can use this and get deeper and deeper in nesting and making more specific.                |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=999.4)   | You could use commas in these and more other types of selectors.                                   |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1003.72) | Also if you're not super familiar with selectors, definitely check out our selector episode        |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1006.96) | or check out our web.dev slash learn CSS course that we just put out because we have a great       |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1013.16) | module on selectors.                                                                               |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1014.4)  | In there, we'll learn all about direct descendants, sibling selectors, et cetera.                  |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1018.88) | So all of this is to say that under the hood, is is happening.                                     |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1022.22) | You could even nest things like media queries and ad supports.                                     |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1026.0)  | And if we take a look at that example again, you could see how is can make something like          |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1033.04) | this a little bit lighter.                                                                         |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1034.28) | If we had not just card, but something like dot card comma dot quotes, and then nested             |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1039.6)  | within that the ampersand direct descendant H1, now you are getting two things where you're        |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1047.28) | doing a direct descendant header of both the card and the quote.                                   |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1052.08) | And those are both getting that same style.                                                        |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1054.4)  | So you could write that as is, so colon is, and then within that dot card comma dot quote          |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1061.18) | greater than H1.                                                                                   |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1062.18) | So this would be a direct descendant of card and quotes getting that style.                        |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1068.16) | So it's the same thing.                                                                            |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1069.16) | It's a different way to write it.                                                                  |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1070.64) | It is gives you the same result, but it's kind of like an inverse way of doing this                |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1074.76) | nesting and writing this nesting.                                                                  |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1077.12) | But what if we wanted to use it somewhere other than in the beginning, Adam?                       |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1081.68) | Right.                                                                                             |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1082.68) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1083.68) | So and is required in order to nesting.                                                            |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1084.88) | It's sort of the flag and it ends up being shorthand so that when you use and inside               |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1090.42) | of there, you could use at nest space and, but and is sort of implied that, well, I'm              |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1097.88) | just building in this one direction.                                                               |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1099.96) | And so you can use that shorthand.                                                                 |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1102.6)  | Now if you don't want to nest directly after that previous selector, like let's say you            |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1106.88) | want to tuck some things before it, you can use at nest.                                           |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1110.96) | And so this shows up in your CSS, like if you had input or just div open curly, you                |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1115.96) | know, had some styles in there and then you said at nest and you could start a new selector,       |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1120.16) | use and and do another curly break.                                                                |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1122.32) | And this is how you'd sort of use it.                                                              |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1123.56) | So it looks kind of like you're nesting a media query, but you're nesting an at nest.              |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1127.24) | And it's just a very declarative way for the browser to know and the parser to know that           |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1131.8)  | following this at nest symbol, there will be an and somewhere.                                     |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1136.62) | And where that and is, is the continuation that the previous selector had.                         |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1140.4)  | So at nest you can use it at the end of a rule.                                                    |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1144.9)  | So it has to be the last style that shows up in a rule.                                            |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1147.56) | So like you can't do like color white at nest and then do like background blue.                    |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1152.12) | You're nesting it with at nest or even with the and symbol do have to be at the end of             |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1156.52) | all of your rules there.                                                                           |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1157.64) | So it's just kind of like a weird little note.                                                     |
| [19:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1159.96) | But I do like thinking of like seeing at nest is a good way to know that nesting is about          |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1164.56) | to occur and it sort of signals to the developers into the browser.                                |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1168.24) | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1169.24) | I could see an example where people are always using at nest.                                      |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1171.56) | But OK, so let's let's go into another example where we're not just doing direct nesting           |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1174.96) | and sort of building selectors to the right.                                                       |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1176.88) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1177.88) | And also another way to kind of think about this ampersand at the end.                             |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1181.6)  | We used to have a term in SAS, I guess, when this was like a thing, which was a trailing           |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1186.28) | ampersand and it behaves a little bit differently because you're not hooking it onto the parent.   |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1191.4)  | You're putting the parent at the end of that.                                                      |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1194.28) | So you're kind of replacing the ampersand with it.                                                 |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1196.52) | Totally.                                                                                           |
| [19:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1197.52) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1198.52) | It often feels like you're replacing the and with the sort of previous context.                    |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1201.72) | And that's even where we'll get into like some of the tricks later where the CSS version           |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1205.04) | is a little different than preprocessors.                                                          |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1206.6)  | But OK, so let's do this example.                                                                  |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1208.52) | We have like input, we have open curlies, then we have at nest space form colon focus              |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1214.06) | within space and.                                                                                  |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1216.72) | So now this input wants to change its style when in the parent form has focus within it.           |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1223.24) | The way that we just did that with nesting is we started with at nest and we start a               |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1227.12) | brand new selector.                                                                                |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1228.62) | When you write at nest, the sky's the limit.                                                       |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1231.72) | And so we said form colon focus within.                                                            |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1235.56) | So now when this form has focus within space and we're now co-locating the styles for a            |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1242.96) | focused form input with the input where we usually would have had to put all these styles          |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1248.08) | with the parent form and they would have been separated.                                           |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1251.32) | But now this input can nest its parent context styles right in with the rest of them.              |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1258.18) | And it's it's really cool.                                                                         |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1260.24) | Let's see.                                                                                         |
| [21:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1261.24) | So nest just you could start a new selector sky's the limit and it just put some new styles        |
| [21:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1266.28) | inside there and nest again.                                                                       |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1267.28) | You can kind of keep going and you can have at nest put that and in the middle, beginning          |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1271.52) | or end.                                                                                            |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1272.56) | And you can repeat the and also.                                                                   |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1274.16) | So there's some kind of cool tricks in there.                                                      |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1275.68) | You can always use at nest if you want.                                                            |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1278.28) | So you don't have to use and to begin things.                                                      |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1281.4)  | It's just as valid to say at nest and under like direct descendant H1 as it is to say              |
| [21:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1286.52) | and direct descendant H1.                                                                          |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1288.24) | I could see like linters enforcing that or something in the future.                                |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1291.32) | But here's another fun example.                                                                    |
| [21:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1292.44) | This one's fun because a child component can become aware of itself being an even or an            |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1296.88) | odd element and then change.                                                                       |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1299.48) | So let's say we have a picture.                                                                    |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1301.82) | It's got aspect ratio one.                                                                         |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1303.1)  | So it's a box.                                                                                     |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1304.4)  | But we want it to change to be a widescreen picture like 16 by nine.                               |
| [21:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1309.02) | If it's, you know, the even element.                                                               |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1312.12) | That way we bring some like dynamic appearance to all of our boxes.                                |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1314.88) | We could say inside of that picture elements styles right after aspect ratio one, we can           |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1319.6)  | say at nest space dot card colon and the child open parentheses even.                              |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1325.64) | So what we've just said there is find all the cards, find the even cards, and then we              |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1330.56) | do space and and that brings in the picture selector.                                              |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1334.2)  | Pops it at the end there and now we can write a new style aspect ratio colon 16 by nine.           |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1339.64) | So now our picture element is aware of some of its parents context in order to give itself         |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1344.68) | a new style and it's all co-located right in one space.                                            |
| [22:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1348.14) | And it's so powerful.                                                                              |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1349.14) | It's so powerful and so succinct.                                                                  |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1351.04) | So at nest definitely knows much less bounds than and and really lets you reach into some          |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1355.66) | complex scenarios.                                                                                 |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1356.76) | That's super cool.                                                                                 |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1358.24) | Yeah, it's really cool to see this kind of syntactic sugar like coming to CSS because              |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1363.16) | I think one of the reasons that people still use this preprocessors is because of how powerful     |
| [22:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1368.8)  | they are in terms of letting you write things condensed in a condensed way.                        |
| [22:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1373.08) | You don't have to write things out as much.                                                        |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1375.58) | And so I think having this is really, really nice.                                                 |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1379.0)  | But it's also important to understand what it's turning into and what you're really getting        |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1382.82) | out of it.                                                                                         |
| [23:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1383.88) | I think that that is pretty core to understanding is where a nesting and it is really interesting  |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1389.24) | to me to think of this as is a nesting being one to one of each other, like the inverse            |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1395.16) | of each other, beginning the same results, depending on how you write it.                          |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1398.46) | So there are a few gotchas and powers and things that you should know.                             |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1404.9)  | Let's talk about some of those.                                                                    |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1406.52) | Awesome.                                                                                           |
| [23:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1407.52) | One of the first ones that people always are surprised by is that you can nest media queries       |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1412.6)  | and add support queries.                                                                           |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1414.38) | So a lot of people are like, oh, I probably can't do that.                                         |
| [23:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1415.92) | And I'm like, yes, you can, I made sure that I made that into the spec.                            |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1419.24) | It was not there at first.                                                                         |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1420.88) | And I was like, wait a sec, we can do that.                                                        |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1423.34) | But here's the kicker, though, is that it's not as terse as it is in your preprocessors.           |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1428.16) | So where you may have been like div and you open up your curlies and then inside of there          |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1431.56) | you say app media max width is 400 pixels.                                                         |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1434.68) | You know, here's some new styles.                                                                  |
| [23:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1436.16) | You can almost do the exact same thing.                                                            |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1438.34) | So with the nesting spec, you would write div curly braces.                                        |
| [24:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1441.6)  | Here's some styles.                                                                                |
| [24:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1442.6)  | You'd say app media, you'd write your whole media query.                                           |
| [24:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1444.56) | You'd open up your curly brackets.                                                                 |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1446.2)  | What you have to do is you forgot an and.                                                          |
| [24:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1449.62) | You have to put an and somewhere or else it doesn't know where to continue your selector.          |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1456.06) | So this is a little bit more to write in the CSS spec.                                             |
| [24:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1459.96) | But what it ends up doing is it takes out this humongous amount of ambiguity from the              |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1463.84) | parser.                                                                                            |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1465.08) | And so Sass ends up, and Stylist, these are doing massive amounts of like trying to figure         |
| [24:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1469.88) | out what you meant.                                                                                |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1471.02) | And when you put the and there, you sort of take the question out of it.                           |
| [24:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1473.9)  | So anyway, you can nest a media query and a support media query.                                   |
| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1477.08) | Just make sure you put like open your curly braces after media query put and and do your           |
| [24:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1480.92) | curly braces.                                                                                      |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1481.92) | So that way that selector context goes inside of that media query, right?                          |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1484.76) | You're like at max width 400, I need my picture element to be 16 by 9.                             |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1489.12) | Well, in order for it to know that the picture elements what you wanted to target, you got         |
| [24:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1492.2)  | to put that and in there.                                                                          |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1493.24) | So it was the and inside of the curly braces or is it next to the app property?                    |
| [24:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1498.32) | It is inside the app media curly braces.                                                           |
| [25:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1502.48) | So it'd be, yeah, app media, open parentheses, whatever media query space curly brackets,          |
| [25:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1508.72) | space and space curly brackets.                                                                    |
| [25:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1511.6)  | Got it.                                                                                            |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1512.6)  | Interesting.                                                                                       |
| [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1513.6)  | Cool.                                                                                              |
| [25:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1514.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1515.6)  | Another thing to note is that if you are using commas, which you can use, they create new          |
| [25:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1517.92) | lines.                                                                                             |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1518.92) | So you have to be careful here.                                                                    |
| [25:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1519.92) | Commas and the ampersand character, aka and, need to exist one to one.                             |
| [25:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1525.2)  | So if you put a comma into a selector and turn it into a list, you'll need another ampersand       |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1529.8)  | in there to make it valid and work the way that you expect it to.                                  |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1533.72) | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [25:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1534.72) | And and is required.                                                                               |
| [25:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1535.72) | So this is another kind of like gotcha for folks is they're coming from SAS or Stylist             |
| [25:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1539.2)  | and they're like, oh, I could just, right now I don't need and I just do a direct descendant       |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1544.24) | thing and go direct descendant P or I can just say P and it sort of figures it all out.            |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1548.84) | Oh, so ignore me earlier where I was like, oh, and then if you didn't have the ampersand,          |
| [25:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1552.2)  | this is what it would look like.                                                                   |
| [25:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1553.2)  | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [25:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1554.2)  | I thought I might've heard you say that in there and I was like, I'm just going to assume          |
| [25:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1556.68) | that-                                                                                              |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1557.68) | You can't do that with the nest spec.                                                              |
| [25:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1558.68) | You can't do that with SAS, but now with the CSS part of it.                                       |
| [26:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1561.08) | All right.                                                                                         |
| [26:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1562.08) | That's important to know because I didn't realize that either.                                     |
| [26:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1564.92) | That's why it's in the gotchas here.                                                               |
| [26:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1565.92) | I'm like, these are just really common things for folks when they're hearing about the spec        |
| [26:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1569.48) | and it kind of like, I at first thought that was kind of annoying cause I'm used to not            |
| [26:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1574.04) | writing it also, but I've come to really appreciate the explicitness and how much more readable    |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1578.8)  | and it takes out all the questions out of things.                                                  |
| [26:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1580.72) | Like especially when your nesting gets complex, having this requirement makes it end up being      |
| [26:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1585.0)  | a lot simpler.                                                                                     |
| [26:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1586.0)  | But yeah, you can do a thing like div and inside of there you could say and.p, so no               |
| [26:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1591.0)  | space and that'd be a div with the class of P. You could have div and space P and that's           |
| [26:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1597.12) | div space P, right?                                                                                |
| [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1598.52) | So by having the and there, you're really being explicit about like, is this directly              |
| [26:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1602.8)  | attached?                                                                                          |
| [26:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1603.98) | So this continuation, am I attaching it and stacking and combining it or am I sort of              |
| [26:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1607.88) | starting a new space and a new selector?                                                           |
| [26:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1610.32) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1611.32) | That's key.                                                                                        |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1612.32) | So having like the and space element that is the same as what in SAS you would not need            |
| [26:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1617.96) | the ampersand for.                                                                                 |
| [26:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1618.96) | But in this case you just have that to be explicit and I honestly think that's better.             |
| [27:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1622.84) | Yep, me too.                                                                                       |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1623.84) | I think it's better.                                                                               |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1625.2)  | The more I used it, the more I realized how ambiguous SAS was.                                     |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1628.64) | I was like, oh, cause you'll talk to some of the folks that work on these pre-processors           |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1631.96) | and they'll send you like these one selectors and they're like, what do you think this means?      |
| [27:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1635.04) | Right?                                                                                             |
| [27:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1636.04) | And you look at it and you're like, Ooh, that's some SAS magic.                                    |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1637.72) | And then you'd start unpacking it and you're like, wow, there's four ways you could make           |
| [27:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1641.98) | a decision here.                                                                                   |
| [27:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1642.98) | And I'm not really sure.                                                                           |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1643.98) | And you're like, what did the author mean?                                                         |
| [27:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1644.98) | We're all like, I don't know.                                                                      |
| [27:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1646.6)  | And this doesn't have that problem.                                                                |
| [27:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1647.84) | So while it has this one requirement that and must be present in all of your continuations,        |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1654.08) | it at least takes away all of the questions about where should that be?                            |
| [27:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1657.72) | And it also gives you some new powers.                                                             |
| [27:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1659.48) | Like you can use and more than once.                                                               |
| [27:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1661.84) | Like there's in the spec, I have like a foo foo foo example.                                       |
| [27:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1664.48) | And it's just like, well, it's just continuing the selector name foo and it's just building        |
| [27:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1668.84) | a foo foo foo.                                                                                     |
| [27:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1669.84) | Like it doesn't matter.                                                                            |
| [27:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1670.84) | Anyway, bunny foo foo again showing up.                                                            |
| [27:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1673.44) | All right.                                                                                         |
| [27:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1675.2)  | So and is required.                                                                                |
| [27:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1676.2)  | That one like gets people all the time.                                                            |
| [27:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1678.26) | Mixing declarations and rules is invalid.                                                          |
| [28:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1680.28) | So I mentioned this earlier and it will result in styles being thrown away.                        |
| [28:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1684.14) | So like, let's say you wrote like color red font size three rem at nest direct underscore          |
| [28:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1689.34) | foo with an and, and then you said margin zero and they need to like at nest bar.                  |
| [28:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1694.68) | You can't sort of be like font size at nest margin at nest, you know, background color             |
| [28:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1700.06) | at nest.                                                                                           |
| [28:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1701.06) | It's just not going to work.                                                                       |
| [28:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1702.06) | You're going to have to put all of your rules at the top.                                          |
| [28:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1704.0)  | And so do all of your margin and background colors and stuff there.                                |
| [28:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1707.12) | And then underneath that, do all of your nesting.                                                  |
| [28:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1709.8)  | So that's a gotcha.                                                                                |
| [28:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1711.2)  | And just essentially don't mix, which is probably a good practice anyway, because specificity      |
| [28:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1716.28) | can get really awkward at that point if you are mixing, cause you don't really know how            |
| [28:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1719.34) | these things are unfolding and where you are in that cascade.                                      |
| [28:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1723.42) | So and then here's another tip, which is you can use where with nesting.                           |
| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1727.8)  | If you just do colon where open parentheses and so you can take the selector that you're           |
| [28:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1732.3)  | working with and wrap it in where using nesting.                                                   |
| [28:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1735.6)  | And so that would be like at nest space colon where open parentheses and you just nested           |
| [29:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1740.62) | whatever this selector context was into a where using nesting pretty swift.                        |
| [29:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1746.04) | Right.                                                                                             |
| [29:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1747.04) | And then the last kicker here is you cannot do BEM syntax concatenation creation inside            |
| [29:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1755.44) | of the nesting spec and that comes down to, you mentioned it earlier, this is a runtime            |
| [29:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1760.9)  | nesting scenario.                                                                                  |
| [29:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1762.06) | This isn't a compiled or pre-computed.                                                             |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1765.86) | So what BEM is, right, is like you'd have like, you'd want to build a selector by nesting          |
| [29:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1771.34) | and in BEM we always do the same where it's like you just sort of like don't even use              |
| [29:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1774.82) | a signifier.                                                                                       |
| [29:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1775.82) | You just start like a dash, right?                                                                 |
| [29:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1776.82) | You're like, oh, here's my modifier.                                                               |
| [29:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1777.82) | And so you dash and you just sort of build it on top of the previous one.                          |
| [29:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1781.18) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [29:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1782.18) | You're building a string essentially.                                                              |
| [29:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1783.18) | You're building a string.                                                                          |
| [29:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1784.18) | And the reason the nesting spec is we're not building strings.                                     |
| [29:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1786.94) | The thing that you're referencing, that paragraph, that div, that whatever that you're bringing    |
| [29:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1791.3)  | in with the and symbol is not a string.                                                            |
| [29:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1794.5)  | That is a real object.                                                                             |
| [29:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1795.98) | That's a typed object.                                                                             |
| [29:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1797.54) | It's rich and it has lots of additional properties.                                                |
| [30:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1802.14) | It's not just some bland string.                                                                   |
| [30:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1803.46) | So it's not like you can just build these things out of nowhere.                                   |
| [30:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1806.58) | Because if you think about it, like how about like dot, you have like div.p versus.p div.          |
| [30:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1812.26) | Anyway, it's like, you know, like a combinators can sort of like rearrange, but they always        |
| [30:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1815.9)  | match the same thing.                                                                              |
| [30:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1817.28) | It's the same thing in CSS where you're dealing now with a interactive rich object selector,       |
| [30:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1822.38) | not a string.                                                                                      |
| [30:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1823.38) | So you cannot concatenate strings in your nesting to sort of build some BEM solution.              |
| [30:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1827.46) | You're still going to have to BEM your way.                                                        |
| [30:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1829.66) | Like if you want to build BEM selectors, you can do it in your preprocessor and then use           |
| [30:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1833.3)  | a, you know, native nesting for the rest of your nesting if you want to.                           |
| [30:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1836.66) | So yeah, that's the final gotcha.                                                                  |
| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1838.74) | No BEM.                                                                                            |
| [30:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1839.74) | You got to have that AND and you can nest media queries.                                           |
| [30:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1842.58) | Just got to have that AND.                                                                         |
| [30:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1843.58) | Yeah, that's a good gotcha.                                                                        |
| [30:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1845.14) | It's a good thing to note because it does not work exactly like Sass nesting.                      |
| [30:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1850.18) | The couple of ways of the ampersand and because it's not a string, it is runtime.                  |
| [30:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1854.06) | So you need to have a valid selector to nest.                                                      |
| [30:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1858.26) | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [30:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1859.26) | Yes, exactly.                                                                                      |
| [31:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1860.26) | Very cool.                                                                                         |
| [31:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1861.26) | This was quite a journey.                                                                          |
| [31:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1862.74) | Definitely something that I want to use more of.                                                   |
| [31:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1864.86) | I think that is and where are super powerful and they work in modern browsers, so there's          |
| [31:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1870.06) | no reason not to use them.                                                                         |
| [31:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1871.58) | So definitely check those out.                                                                     |
| [31:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1873.94) | There's probably also polyfills and we'll have those in the show notes.                            |
| [31:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1877.54) | I'm sure that there's polyfills.                                                                   |
| [31:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1880.02) | Not for selective or for giving selector lists or squashing specificity, but for the grouping      |
| [31:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1885.34) | concepts.                                                                                          |
| [31:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1886.34) | I'm sure you could do that.                                                                        |
| [31:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1887.34) | Yeah, I'm sure for the grouping because essentially PostGSS could just read that and then write    |
| [31:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1892.58) | it out in long form.                                                                               |
| [31:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1894.18) | So that's not going to be for where, but it's going to be for is.                                  |
| [31:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1898.06) | We have plugins for the nesting spec also and those even get rid of the is.                        |
| [31:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1902.42) | So they'll take your at nest clever syntax and totally output something that's good enough         |
| [31:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1907.42) | for IE9 or whatever.                                                                               |
| [31:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1908.98) | Yeah, very cool.                                                                                   |

| [32:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3WiLji83Iz2kuKuQGxJ6DY?&t=1926.0)  | functional pseudo class selectors.                                                                 |
