| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=17.48)   | Today's episode is about layout, specifically about Flexbox.                                        |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=21.0)    | Flexbox!                                                                                            |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=22.0)    | And today we're covering the flexible box model.                                                    |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=24.44)   | Really, you should see the position this spec can't get into.                                       |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=28.0)    | Woo!                                                                                                |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=29.0)    | Welcome, and we're talking about the more commonly known Flexbox spec.                              |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=32.52)   | It was standardized in 2018.                                                                        |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=34.64)   | This made responsive layouts easier because responsibility of layout could be put on the            |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=38.8)    | parent, just like how Grid works today.                                                             |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=40.84)   | I remember this struggled with a few names too.                                                     |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=42.8)    | It was DisplayBox and then DisplayFlexbox and finally settled on DisplayFlex.                       |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=47.76)   | What makes it bendy though, Yuna?                                                                   |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=49.24)   | Well, with Flexbox, elements can shrink and grow to fit their available space.                      |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=54.04)   | With Flexbox, a parent has better control over the placement of its children within                 |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=58.24)   | the layout.                                                                                         |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=59.72)   | Layouts can either be vertical or horizontal.                                                       |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=62.04)   | This is bi-directional styling, which is super cool.                                                |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=65.24)   | With Flexbox, responsive layouts without media queries become possible.                             |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=69.18)   | It's such an exciting revelation in CSS land, and you've probably used it before, but are           |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=74.28)   | you using Flexbox to its full power?                                                                |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=76.6)    | We're going to find out in this episode.                                                            |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=78.5)    | As an overview, the Flexbox model and display property give us a few types of power.                |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=83.28)   | One of them is layouts can be in any direction.                                                     |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=85.96)   | They can flow in any direction like row, column, or reversed.                                       |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=88.72)   | They can be aligned linearly to never wrap or allowed to wrap to multiple lines along               |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=93.96)   | a secondary axis, also known as the cross axis.                                                     |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=97.08)   | They can dynamically collapse or un-collapse along the main axis while preserving the container's   |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=101.68)  | cross size.                                                                                         |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=102.9)   | And layouts can have their visual display order reversed independent of the content                 |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=107.24)  | order on the page.                                                                                  |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=108.24)  | This one's tricky.                                                                                  |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=109.24)  | I agree.                                                                                            |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=110.24)  | It's a little different than writing mode.                                                          |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=111.24)  | It's elements that flex, shrink, or stretch their sizes to respond to available space               |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=116.12)  | based on intrinsic or extrinsic influences.                                                         |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=119.04)  | And those child elements can be aligned either with respect to their parents or to each other.      |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=124.22)  | So that's super cool and just reminds me of aligning things in Illustrator, and it's just           |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=128.96)  | so exciting.                                                                                        |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=129.96)  | I agree.                                                                                            |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=131.08)  | I think of Flexbox all the time.                                                                    |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=132.48)  | I even had a CSS project that made it even show the align panel, but Flexbox is a lot               |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=136.96)  | like that align panel on design tools.                                                              |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=138.6)   | For sure.                                                                                           |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=139.6)   | It's a panel where you can either align to your artboard or to the selection.                       |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=142.08)  | Anyway, yeah, it's got those buttons to center things vertically or horizontally, but it            |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=145.44)  | also has those buttons to distribute things evenly, which is really nice.                           |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=148.94)  | And that's totally what Flexbox is empowering you as a layout author.                               |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=152.52)  | Flex, ignoring that it can wrap for now to just keep them until a load light, is a single           |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=156.32)  | direction layout strategy, rows or columns aligned and distributed into a container.                |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=161.22)  | When you apply a display of flex to an element, you're essentially placing the parent into          |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=165.64)  | the block flow of the page and applying the flexible box model to its children.                     |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=170.38)  | When you apply inline flex, the parent stays in the inline flow of the page.                        |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=174.52)  | Check out our episode about spacing to hear more about block versus inline.                         |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=178.68)  | And there's a lot more about these display types.                                                   |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=180.68)  | So episode nine is the episode you want, which is last episode to hear more about this.             |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=185.14)  | But before we get into the properties of Flexbox and all different capabilities and what they       |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=189.52)  | mean, we have a few terms to go over.                                                               |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=191.86)  | We already mentioned the terms cross axis and cross size, so let's break those down                 |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=196.82)  | and how those compare to the main size and the main axis.                                           |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=200.24)  | Totally agree.                                                                                      |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=201.24)  | And so let's start with main axis or the main dimension.                                            |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=204.84)  | And it has a start and end concept.                                                                 |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=206.78)  | So to explain the main axis, I want you to visualize three boxes on a shelf in a row                |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=210.66)  | side by side.                                                                                       |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=212.04)  | Now picture Zoro.                                                                                   |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=214.1)   | You are Zoro.                                                                                       |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=215.18)  | Take out your sword and slice the boxes in half from left to right.                                 |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=218.88)  | Okay, you just sliced along the main axis.                                                          |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=221.36)  | You got some Fruit Ninja action.                                                                    |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=223.64)  | It's super Fruit Ninja.                                                                             |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=224.64)  | I even sliced my air over here.                                                                     |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=226.96)  | But you entered at the main start and you exited at main end and traveled in the reading            |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=232.22)  | direction from left to right.                                                                       |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=233.8)   | So it's really important to think about us as Latin readers.                                        |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=236.66)  | We read this direction and that's the direction of this main axis and its slice.                    |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=240.96)  | This main axis is a horizontal axis for flex children to align and distribute along.                |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=245.52)  | And let's quickly cover what happens when they wrap.                                                |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=248.16)  | So imagine now we have five boxes instead of three and the two new boxes couldn't fit               |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=251.84)  | on the top shelf.                                                                                   |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=252.84)  | So we put them on a shelf just below.                                                               |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=254.7)   | Each row gets a main axis and that means that each shelf gets a visit from Zoro.                    |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=259.32)  | Slice slice.                                                                                        |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=260.32)  | That's two slices across the main axis.                                                             |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=262.2)   | And I guess Zoro is the flex compiler now.                                                          |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=264.84)  | Anyway, so that was the main axis and how it travels.                                               |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=267.62)  | It goes directionally and it starts and ends somewhere and it should be applicable to the           |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=272.0)   | reading mode.                                                                                       |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=273.0)   | So then we have main size.                                                                          |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=274.24)  | And in the case of our visual, main size is shared amongst the two rows somewhere defined           |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=278.52)  | on the parent and so much that three boxes could fit.                                               |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=281.24)  | So this is the container's width essentially, but more specifically, it's the inline size.          |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=285.92)  | Flex can have an unknown main size where it's the total of the children items or it can             |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=290.08)  | be fixed to a length which is great for wrapping child items.                                       |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=293.28)  | So then we have the cross axis or the cross dimension.                                              |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=296.7)   | If the main axis is horizontal, if it's that cut that you made horizontally, then the cross         |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=301.56)  | axis is vertical.                                                                                   |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=303.18)  | So this would be akin to the default block flow of the content.                                     |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=306.36)  | But with flexbox, we can determine that flow in the direction.                                      |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=309.84)  | And then you also have the cross start and the cross end.                                           |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=313.18)  | So these are flex lines.                                                                            |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=314.58)  | Like when you wrap lines with content in flexbox, you place the overflowing content onto the        |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=320.8)   | container starting on the cross start side of the flex container and going toward the               |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=325.36)  | cross end size.                                                                                     |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=327.0)   | So again, you could think of that as akin to the block flow of your flex layout.                    |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=330.14)  | When you have items wrapping, they're going to start going from top to bottom in a left             |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=334.32)  | to right, top to bottom language like English.                                                      |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=337.42)  | Now for cross size, this is either the width or the height of a flex container or flex item,        |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=342.44)  | whichever is in the cross dimension.                                                                |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=345.14)  | That is its boxes cross size.                                                                       |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=348.44)  | Flex elements stretch by default.                                                                   |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=350.38)  | So if you apply flex to a parent, you might notice the elements are stretching to all               |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=354.32)  | maintain the same vertical size.                                                                    |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=356.92)  | And this is that max cross size.                                                                    |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=359.28)  | The min cross size describes the element with the smallest width or height based on that            |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=363.52)  | cross dimension.                                                                                    |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=364.66)  | So if it's the default of row, that min cross size would be the minimum height.                     |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=368.48)  | It's almost like instead of Zoro who slices from left to right, you show up with a battle           |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=372.68)  | axe and you chop it from top to bottom.                                                             |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=374.52)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=375.52)  | So I guess Fruit Ninja wasn't the perspective because you can do either in that.                    |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=380.48)  | It's like the main access is Zoro and the cross access is a brutish Dwarven elf.                    |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=385.52)  | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=386.52)  | Anyway, I've been playing too many fantasy video games apparently.                                  |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=388.36)  | Listen, we're all playing video games.                                                              |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=391.08)  | I agree.                                                                                            |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=392.08)  | All right.                                                                                          |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=393.08)  | It's okay.                                                                                          |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=394.08)  | So with all these advanced concepts and all these meaningful contexts like writing direction        |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=398.16)  | and reading direction for our layouts to use comes a succinct set of tools by Flexbox.              |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=403.3)   | So while we don't expect anyone to memorize how Flexbox axes and dimensions work, we did            |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=408.72)  | feel they could be super helpful if you're debugging something complex or if you're just            |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=412.48)  | looking at the Firefox dev tools and the way that they handle Flexbox.                              |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=415.88)  | So now onto some of the familiar flex props we've come to know and love.                            |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=419.28)  | They give us the powers of ordering, aligning, distributing, and stretching.                        |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=422.64)  | And we're going to start with ordering and orientation.                                             |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=425.9)   | And that leads us to flex direction.                                                                |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=428.34)  | So flex direction can take row or row reverse or column or column reverse, and it establishes       |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=433.68)  | the main access.                                                                                    |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=434.92)  | So like our swords slice direction.                                                                 |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=436.8)   | So if you row reverse, you would now slice from right to left.                                      |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=439.82)  | So anyway, just kind of interesting.                                                                |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=440.9)   | This is the direction.                                                                              |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=441.9)   | The flex direction sets the main access and the direction.                                          |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=445.5)   | So respectful of the current writing mode is flex direction by default, and it affects              |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=449.88)  | overload scrolling containers as well.                                                              |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=451.6)   | So if you set something to row reverse, it will scroll from the other direction.                    |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=455.82)  | And reverse values don't reverse the box ordering.                                                  |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=458.68)  | They only change the flow direction.                                                                |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=460.22)  | So Yuna, you'd mentioned that earlier.                                                              |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=461.72)  | Yeah, so that's just something that you have to be cognizant of because with screen readers,        |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=466.16)  | you're not going to be reading it in the visual order that you apply to Flexbox.                    |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=469.68)  | You're going to be reading it based on what the DOM says, how you wrote it in the markdown.         |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=474.24)  | Another great feature of Flexbox is flex wrap.                                                      |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=477.32)  | Wrap brings us into the cross-dimension mentality of Flexbox where you're slicing from top to       |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=481.76)  | bottom.                                                                                             |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=482.8)   | Flex items in a flex container are laid out and aligned within flex lines, which are these          |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=488.18)  | hypothetical containers used for grouping and alignment by the layout algorithm.                    |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=492.82)  | So these can either be single or multi-line depending on this flex wrap property.                   |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=496.8)   | And we'll get to that in a second.                                                                  |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=498.4)   | By default, these Flexbox items stay in a single file flex line among the main axis,                |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=504.6)   | so either aligned horizontally or vertically depending on the flex direction that you set.          |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=509.32)  | But when you set a flex wrap of wrap, this allows for those items to be placed onto the             |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=513.86)  | next row or the cross axis, along that cross axis.                                                  |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=518.6)   | So what does that look like?                                                                        |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=519.98)  | Say you have a grid of cards and you want those cards to fit their space.                           |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=523.12)  | But when that space is too tight, you want them to flow into the next line and expand               |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=527.06)  | for a nicer view, you'd need the wrap property set.                                                 |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=530.8)   | You can write this as a shorthand that looks like display flex space wrap, or you can set           |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=535.2)   | it as flex wrap wrap in its own property.                                                           |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=538.3)   | Now I want to go write a flex wrap about flex wrap.                                                 |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=541.64)  | Oh, stupid dad joke.                                                                                |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=543.88)  | You should freestyle.                                                                               |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=544.88)  | Yeah, just freestyle about flex.                                                                    |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=546.36)  | It's all good.                                                                                      |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=547.36)  | Okay, so jokes aside, nice recap of that flex wrap.                                                 |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=551.16)  | Let's move on to flex flow.                                                                         |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=552.92)  | And this is shorthand for direction and wrap in one fell swoop.                                     |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=556.0)   | So this defines the flex containers main and cross axes at one time.                                |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=561.0)   | Ooh, flex flow, bi directional.                                                                     |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=563.64)  | So this handy prop can take such gems as column wrap, or row reverse wrap reverse so that           |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=569.84)  | new lines actually start to wrap upwards.                                                           |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=572.64)  | That's kind of interesting.                                                                         |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=573.92)  | So the default value of flex flow is row no wrap.                                                   |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=577.2)   | So that's why flex containers aren't wrapping by default, and they go from left to right.           |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=581.32)  | But you could just set flex flow column wrap and you could do a wrapping column set.                |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=584.98)  | So anyway, this is also writing mode sensitive.                                                     |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=586.96)  | So imagine a B and C are boxes, and then a new line for the letter D. Now row wrap tries            |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=592.66)  | to tuck everything into the top left row wrap flex flow row wrap top left.                          |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=598.0)   | Now flip on Japanese with writing mode vertical dash RL and the same flex flow wrap starts          |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=603.92)  | in the top right corner flowing new lines to the left.                                              |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=607.12)  | And so we'll include a demo of this in the show notes.                                              |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=609.06)  | You can find the code pen, but it's really neat.                                                    |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=610.88)  | You see ABC and then a new line for D in English is all on the top left and then ABC D D's          |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=616.76)  | on a new line, but it's actually on the left of a new line and everything's tucked in the           |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=620.08)  | top right in Japanese and you get that all for free.                                                |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=622.72)  | So so cool.                                                                                         |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=623.72)  | That's awesome.                                                                                     |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=624.72)  | And we will have an upcoming show where we dive deeper into logical properties and directionality   |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=628.88)  | and what all that means.                                                                            |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=630.88)  | But Adam, are you going to flow in your flex wrap?                                                  |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=634.72)  | Oh, you know it because I but I'm going to reverse the order just like Nosted.                      |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=640.52)  | Oh, a flow reverse.                                                                                 |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=642.28)  | I quit the dad joke game.                                                                           |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=643.84)  | Not very good at it.                                                                                |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=644.84)  | I loved it.                                                                                         |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=645.84)  | It's great.                                                                                         |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=646.84)  | But Adam, did you know that you can also change the order of your flex items?                       |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=650.96)  | Shut up.                                                                                            |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=651.96)  | No.                                                                                                 |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=652.96)  | This one is something that you also need to be careful with because changing the order              |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=656.76)  | only applies to visual changes, as I mentioned earlier, and not changes in the DOM tree.            |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=661.56)  | The DOM tree retains their original structure.                                                      |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=664.12)  | So for a screen reader, if you adjusted order or direction of flex box, the screen reader           |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=669.02)  | would still read the DOM tree, not the visual screen representation, which you altered by           |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=674.0)   | using these flex properties.                                                                        |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=676.44)  | But if you want to do this, living life on the edge, you can use the order property.                |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=681.88)  | One way to order items is to explicitly set numeric orders for each flex item.                      |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=686.28)  | Like you can write order colon three.                                                               |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=688.8)   | That's the order property setting it to three for a specific item within the flexible box           |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=693.64)  | parent.                                                                                             |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=694.64)  | And another technique is to use order negative one to have any item that you set it to proceed      |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=700.4)   | all the other items within the flex container.                                                      |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=703.12)  | So if you use negative one, it's always going to be the first item because it's going to            |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=705.88)  | be before any other items.                                                                          |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=707.58)  | So an example of this is, say you have a tab group on a web page, but inside that you have          |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=713.4)   | content, and you want the current tab to always be pinned to the front of the tab group.            |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=717.96)  | You could give the tab group a display flex as its parent, and then have an active class            |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=723.46)  | where that active class gets order negative one.                                                    |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=726.72)  | So this will visually bring the active tab to the first spot in that tab group flex box             |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=732.6)   | appearance of that tab group flex box box.                                                          |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=737.76)  | So again, you get this cool interaction for free, but you got to keep accessibility in              |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=742.4)   | mind.                                                                                               |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=743.4)   | It's probably better to do this in JavaScript, but you can make adjustments with visual flow        |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=748.28)  | and order of your page by using flex box.                                                           |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=750.76)  | It reminds me a lot of the WordPress sites we built back in the day would need a sticky             |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=754.96)  | post.                                                                                               |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=756.34)  | And a sticky post wasn't like the CSS sticky we have today, but it just is this.                    |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=760.0)   | Basically I could have set order to negative one and always had it be first in the list             |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=763.22)  | and I'd have a sticky post.                                                                         |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=764.68)  | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                      |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=765.68)  | Anyway, editorial site.                                                                             |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=767.42)  | Really cool.                                                                                        |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=768.42)  | Very nice.                                                                                          |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=769.42)  | All right, so let's talk about the flexibility of flex.                                             |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=771.88)  | What about flex makes it flexy?                                                                     |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=774.12)  | Or why does it even get the cool word of flex?                                                      |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=776.28)  | And is it talking about its muscles or is it talking about its ability to stretch?                  |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=779.96)  | It's talking about its ability to stretch.                                                          |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=782.12)  | So as a quick shorthand, the flex shorthand.                                                        |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=784.08)  | So we're talking about flex as in like the rule that you're setting, the CSS properties.            |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=788.28)  | So flex colon something.                                                                            |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=790.02)  | Usually you might set this to like flex colon one or flex colon two.                                |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=792.92)  | And I like to use this to describe priority, percentage or ratios, but really you can kind          |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=797.4)   | of use it in a few different ways.                                                                  |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=798.48)  | It has multi uses.                                                                                  |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=799.98)  | And I personally like to think of it as like space priority where the following patterns            |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=803.28)  | are like a minimum and maximum of space to fill, but it's not limited to that.                      |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=806.84)  | So like I'll say, this is a stronger item in this layout and I'll give it a flex of                 |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=810.08)  | two and everything else has a flex of one.                                                          |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=811.96)  | And it's just kind of fun to express my ratios that way.                                            |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=814.64)  | This shorthand can be fully used to specify grow, shrink and basis, which we'll cover               |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=818.64)  | in a second in one fell swoop.                                                                      |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=820.34)  | And you know, the default is flex colon zero space one space auto.                                  |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=824.52)  | What does that mean in terms of like the flexibility of your children when that's the default?      |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=829.36)  | Zero one auto.                                                                                      |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=830.52)  | With flex zero one auto, we're looking at the grow factor, the shrink factor, and then              |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=835.28)  | the flex basis.                                                                                     |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=836.52)  | So what zero one auto says is I don't want this element to grow in the horizontal space.            |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=842.12)  | I do want it to shrink in the horizontal space.                                                     |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=844.88)  | And the default flex spaces of that is going to be automatically set based on the size              |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=849.32)  | of the content itself.                                                                              |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=850.92)  | So that's the default when you set this to flex.                                                    |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=853.64)  | Excellent.                                                                                          |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=854.64)  | And authors are encouraged to set the flex grow and flex shrink values in the flex shorthand        |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=859.84)  | like this, but they are also individual values and you can write them individually.                 |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=865.32)  | Flex grow and flex shrink are comparative values based on other flex items and that                 |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=870.96)  | available space.                                                                                    |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=872.02)  | So if we look at flex grow, flex grow is a number which specifies the flex grow factor              |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=877.12)  | that determines how much an item will grow relative to the rest of the items in the flex            |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=881.36)  | container when positive free space is distributed.                                                  |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=885.04)  | This means as free space increases, this factor determines how each item will fit into that         |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=890.76)  | space accordingly.                                                                                  |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=892.26)  | So as I mentioned earlier, items get a flex grow value of zero by default, meaning they             |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=896.26)  | don't grow to fit available space along the main axis unless you're using the flex keyword          |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=901.24)  | and omitting the flex grow value.                                                                   |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=903.24)  | This is kind of tricky.                                                                             |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=904.88)  | In that case, flex grow becomes one by default.                                                     |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=908.4)   | That flex grow value of one means the item takes up 100% of the free space.                         |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=913.08)  | So if you're setting flex with just a flex basis unit value, you're going to get a flex             |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=918.1)   | grow value of one by default.                                                                       |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=920.52)  | Interesting.                                                                                        |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=921.52)  | Yeah, this I thought was really interesting because I didn't realize until I started actually       |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=924.92)  | looking into the spec and the code itself.                                                          |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=927.48)  | So if that's applied to every item, it's a bit like the CSS grid concept of fractional              |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=931.72)  | space units, which we'll get into in our next grid episode.                                         |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=935.42)  | If you want one item to take up more space as available space expands, you could set                |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=939.42)  | that to two.                                                                                        |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=940.42)  | You could set the flex grow to two, so that'll make the growth two to one compared to other         |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=944.86)  | items that have maybe one or zero as their flex grow factor.                                        |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=948.48)  | So we also have flex shrink, which is the opposite of flex grow, and this determines                |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=952.28)  | how much the item will shrink relative to the rest of the items in the flex container               |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=956.84)  | when negative free space is distributed.                                                            |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=959.6)   | Meaning when you need those items to squeeze into a smaller available space, and this is            |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=963.54)  | set to one by default.                                                                              |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=964.54)  | Awesome.                                                                                            |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=965.54)  | I like that flex shrink at zero means never shrink below my min content, which is kind              |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=970.04)  | of like a fun, it'll never have word wrapping and stuff, but it's like flex shrink at zero          |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=974.56)  | is shrink wrap, essentially.                                                                        |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=976.04)  | Anyway, I like that was a good visual.                                                              |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=978.64)  | All right, so the last one here we have is flex basis, and this is the default size that            |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=982.36)  | an element will take up before trying to shrink or grow.                                            |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=986.02)  | So it can be a length or a keyword, it could be min content, and it's relative to the main          |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=990.74)  | size.                                                                                               |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=991.74)  | So you can kind of set this to be an explicit value or something that's a little bit more           |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=995.24)  | flexible and it's relative to the main size.                                                        |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=997.36)  | So that was like the width of our container, the inline size of our container.                      |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1000.72) | By default, flex basis is set to auto, which pretty much means look at my width or height           |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1004.52) | property for a value here, which means it's intrinsic.                                              |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1007.3)  | So I love it.                                                                                       |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1008.32) | And if flex basis is set to zero, extra space around it isn't a factor, which normally extra        |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1013.04) | space is distributed based on the flex grow value, setting it to zero is kind of like               |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1017.16) | shrink wrapping it again.                                                                           |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1018.16) | It's like denying the space outside of you.                                                         |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1019.96) | It's kind of interesting.                                                                           |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1021.28) | Our next big topic is positioning, which is justification and alignment of items.                   |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1026.48) | And this one is really big, so we're just going to dive right into it.                              |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1029.46) | So the first topic of conversation is justify content in typography, justified text appears         |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1035.6)  | even at both ends, taking up all space in the road to create perfect columns.                       |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1040.4)  | Like you would see in a newspaper, the space between that line of text is then analyzed             |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1045.68) | to allow the two end points to align to the edge and the space between evenly distributed           |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1050.6)  | among those words.                                                                                  |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1051.92) | So in the flex world, this would be justify content space between that's if the flex direction      |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1057.96) | is horizontal, just to give you that visual.                                                        |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1060.74) | With justification, you can space the flex containers children on its main axis.                    |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1065.54) | So if the flex direction was vertical, you could use that to align card items to the                |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1069.56) | height of the card with the space between being evenly distributed.                                 |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1073.58) | There's a lot of flex fun to be had here, but there are more justification strategies               |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1077.72) | than just the space between there's space around, where you can justify your content                |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1081.98) | with even margins, which divide the available space around the elements.                            |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1086.76) | The biggest difference here with space between and space around is that with space around,          |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1091.34) | the two outermost items are not flush the edges of the flex box, but have some spacing.             |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1096.38) | Also note that this is not a replacement for the gap property in flex box, which currently          |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1100.86) | isn't supported yet, but soon will be.                                                              |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1103.52) | The items here when using space around will not be evenly distributed since the interior            |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1108.3)  | items will get double spacing as compared to the outer items.                                       |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1112.52) | There's also the justification for justify content center.                                          |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1116.24) | This just centers all your flex items on that main axis.                                            |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1119.8)  | There's justify content flex start, which pushes all the flex items to the start of                 |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1123.86) | the flex box.                                                                                       |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1125.06) | And there's flex end, which pushes all the flex items to the end of the flex box.                   |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1129.08) | Nice breakdown of justify content.                                                                  |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1130.9)  | I'm always reminded, or at least I try to remind myself and think about text alignment              |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1134.3)  | icons and like a document editor app when I'm thinking about justify content, because               |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1138.14) | it helps me remember it's not vertical alignment.                                                   |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1140.98) | It's like I still to this day, I'll write display flex and I'm like, is it justify                  |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1143.8)  | content or align items that puts it vertically center or like I want to align to the right          |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1148.1)  | and say, okay, so justify content.                                                                  |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1149.9)  | I just think of those icons.                                                                        |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1151.42) | Yeah, anyway, hopefully that helps somebody out there.                                              |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1154.02) | Okay, so speaking of vertical alignment, because that was essentially justify content is horizontal |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1158.3)  | alignment.                                                                                          |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1159.3)  | We have two types of vertical alignment in flex box.                                                |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1162.4)  | We have align items and we have aligned content.                                                    |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1165.42) | So this is the cross axis.                                                                          |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1166.96) | This is like the ax that was coming down on top of the boxes.                                       |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1169.64) | It's perpendicular to our main axis and it's complimentary.                                         |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1172.54) | So we can align both horizontally and vertically.                                                   |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1174.34) | This is pretty much our vertical alignment strategy.                                                |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1177.3)  | And in these two types, let's talk about how they're different and then dig into their              |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1180.7)  | accepted values.                                                                                    |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1182.08) | So align items.                                                                                     |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1183.5)  | This is for vertical alignment of items inside a single row.                                        |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1187.38) | Reading mode is the left to right, top to bottom reading mode or right to left, top                 |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1191.64) | to bottom.                                                                                          |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1192.64) | Yes, it's always reading mode contextual.                                                           |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1194.24) | So this is the cross axis and how it's, yeah, this is why it's so special and awesome.              |
| [19:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1198.28) | So that was by items.                                                                               |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1199.68) | And so if you think about our example where we had three boxes and then two boxes on two            |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1203.48) | shelves, align items would reference each shelf.                                                    |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1206.76) | Now align content is for, and it only works if there's multiple rows, like in our example,          |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1212.2)  | we just specified.                                                                                  |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1213.28) | And it's great for moving flex children around as a group where align items was per each            |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1217.56) | row.                                                                                                |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1218.56) | So that's the sort of critical thing here is align items would say each shelf gets aligned          |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1222.8)  | this way and align content says, no, all the shelves need to go to the top of my container          |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1227.1)  | or all the shelves should go to the bottom of my container.                                         |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1229.32) | Essentially, one is container focused cross axis alignment and the other is row by row              |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1233.88) | cross axis alignment.                                                                               |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1235.16) | Anyway, I hope that helps somebody out there.                                                       |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1237.64) | Align items and align content default to stretch also, which I think is a very interesting          |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1242.14) | choice as it's one of the first things I tend to remove in a flex container.                        |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1245.88) | I like that their width is intrinsic, but then their height gets stretched to match.                |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1249.76) | Anyway, so just a little side note from me, let's go back to aligning our items here.               |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1254.68) | So we also can pass in so in line items and align content, you have the following properties        |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1259.84) | you can pass which are similar to justify content.                                                  |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1261.92) | We have flex start, which aligns items to where the reading direction starts.                       |
| [21:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1265.64) | You could think of this like top flex end aligns items to where the reading direction               |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1269.28) | ends.                                                                                               |
| [21:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1270.28) | Or you could think about this like the bottom center vertically center on the main axis.            |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1273.84) | So remember, if we have two rows, that's going to be center of each of those axis.                  |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1277.44) | But if we're doing justify or align content, we're going to do the axis of the container            |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1282.2)  | as a group.                                                                                         |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1283.2)  | So anyway, just a reminder that could be multiple axis and so center and all these kind of work     |
| [21:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1287.28) | within there.                                                                                       |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1288.28) | We also have baseline.                                                                              |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1289.32) | And this one's really special and interesting.                                                      |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1291.08) | Baseline is where the items are along to the typographic baseline shared amongst the flex           |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1294.92) | items.                                                                                              |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1295.92) | It's very unique and really interesting.                                                            |
| [21:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1297.6)  | It can make some really cool layouts.                                                               |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1299.44) | And I'd love to see what other people are doing with this property.                                 |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1301.56) | I've only used it a couple times.                                                                   |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1303.2)  | And then we have stretch.                                                                           |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1304.24) | So this is the final attribute you can pass to align items or align content.                        |
| [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1307.88) | And this is also the default just to remind you.                                                    |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1309.86) | And this will cause the children to stretch to fit the block size or vertically as it               |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1313.56) | may appear or you might like to think about it.                                                     |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1315.48) | So it's like it'll stretch to the height.                                                           |
| [21:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1316.68) | And this can be handy for having three cards having the same height next to each other,             |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1320.08) | which is pretty typical use case.                                                                   |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1321.56) | I thought that was a really great explanation of the align contents versus align items,             |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1326.04) | which I'm constantly fumbling about.                                                                |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1328.36) | But there is also a weird flexbox gotcha to remember.                                               |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1332.0)  | And that is that justify items does not exist in flexbox.                                           |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1335.96) | It works in grid.                                                                                   |
| [22:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1337.64) | And at the same note, justify self does not exist in flexbox.                                       |
| [22:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1342.2)  | It's actually ignored in flexbox table and block display context.                                   |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1346.28) | But you can set it on the child element in a grid layout to align it on that inline axis.           |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1351.52) | So we will talk about this a little bit more in our next episode when we cover grid.                |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1356.52) | Right on.                                                                                           |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1357.52) | All right.                                                                                          |
| [22:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1358.52) | So that means the last one we have then is align self.                                              |
| [22:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1360.44) | And this is for individual exceptions and the element in the items child themselves                 |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1365.96) | can provide a way to escape the group alignment or the group justification and take over this       |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1370.88) | alignment at the item level itself, almost like it's claiming its own alignment, which              |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1374.8)  | is kind of neat.                                                                                    |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1375.8)  | Totally.                                                                                            |
| [22:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1376.8)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L7jidxKmTcF1eo915Y9ZZ?&t=1377.8)  | So we hope that you learned a lot about layout, flexbox, alignment and justification today.         |
