| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z index.                      |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=17.32)   | Today we're talking about CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables.                                |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=23.12)   | CSS custom properties were a huge change to CSS when they were first introduced in browsers                  |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=28.72)   | because they truly enable dynamic CSS variables.                                                             |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=33.28)   | What do I mean by that?                                                                                      |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=34.28)   | Well, before CSS custom properties were native in browsers, creating variables in preprocessors              |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=39.44)   | like Sass was pretty popular, except those variables eventually got converted into static                    |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=44.66)   | variables.                                                                                                   |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=45.76)   | They were only build time variables, not run time variables.                                                 |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=49.72)   | With custom properties, all of that changed because now you could write CSS values that                      |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=54.6)    | were updatable and adjustable that lived within your CSS files and allowed access to                         |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=59.6)    | create styles that weren't possible before.                                                                  |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=62.8)    | You could now separate logic and styling, writing the styles in your CSS and updating                        |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=67.36)   | them in JavaScript where you needed, and that kept things a whole lot more readable.                         |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=72.24)   | Good call.                                                                                                   |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=73.24)   | We got reactive properties which propagate to all the uses like a state store would in                       |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=78.4)    | JavaScript updating subscribers, declared on any element, inherited by default, resolved                     |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=84.24)   | via the cascading, can even be made into conditionals with media queries in JavaScript.                      |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=89.38)   | In CSS, they're free, super fast, make things easier to read, unlock lots of superpowers,                    |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=94.76)   | they're accessible via JavaScript, they can be animated, and maybe they're even kind of                      |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=98.92)   | fun and stuff, but there's also complex.                                                                     |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=102.24)  | So classic CSS, right?                                                                                       |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=104.02)  | Super easy to get started with, wicked hard to master.                                                       |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=107.36)  | And when you're getting started with custom properties, you're going to have to set them                     |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=110.72)  | or create them.                                                                                              |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=112.12)  | And in CSS, we're allowed to assign just willy-nilly values to a custom property as long as you              |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=117.6)   | give it a name.                                                                                              |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=118.6)   | And I mean willy-nilly arbitrary whatever.                                                                   |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=121.76)  | It's awesome because you can store just the channels of a color value in there or even                       |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=126.28)  | just a fraction of a channel.                                                                                |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=127.6)   | Like it just doesn't care.                                                                                   |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=129.4)   | It's awesome.                                                                                                |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=130.4)   | So this also is why app property is valuable because, well, that goes in there and it's                      |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=134.12)  | very specific about what it can accept.                                                                      |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=136.08)  | It's kind of like the opposite of willy-nilly.                                                               |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=137.56)  | You kind of give it a little bit of some structure.                                                          |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=140.42)  | So you can now give that magic number of 37.5 pixels in your style sheet a name, like Annoying               |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=146.6)   | Offset for blah, blah.                                                                                       |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=147.6)   | You know, dash, dash, Annoying, blah, blah.                                                                  |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=148.6)   | Are those names that you use?                                                                                |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=149.6)   | I mean, if they are annoying, I would be tempted to do that.                                                 |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=156.04)  | But it's nice, right?                                                                                        |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=157.04)  | So you just people behind you can just go read it and feel like, ah, this is just an                         |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=160.2)   | Annoying Offset for blah, blah.                                                                              |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=161.64)  | Okay, makes more sense now because 37.5 pixels sounded a little weird.                                       |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=166.52)  | So when you set these, you always start them with a double dash.                                             |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=170.34)  | The first you'll create with a double dash at the start of the property, at which point                      |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=174.04)  | you are free to provide a custom alias.                                                                      |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=176.8)   | So side note, CSS loves to call aliases idents as the type.                                                  |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=181.32)  | So in case you're wondering where's our type nomenclature today, well, there it was, ident.                  |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=185.44)  | It stands for identifier.                                                                                    |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=187.08)  | So identifier.                                                                                               |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=188.08)  | So it makes some sense.                                                                                      |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=189.08)  | It does.                                                                                                     |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=190.08)  | Yeah, it's just a big word.                                                                                  |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=192.4)   | But it's cool.                                                                                               |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=193.4)   | It's the type.                                                                                               |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=194.4)   | Yeah, so they type all things that are idents get this type.                                                 |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=196.26)  | So just like at keyframes, we'll probably go over that soon in a second.                                     |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=199.54)  | So okay, so you do dash dash, your custom ident, a colon, and then provide the value                         |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=204.68)  | that the variable should hold like a color, percentage, an entire box shadow, part of                        |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=208.4)   | a box shadow, an entire gradient, part of a gradient, whatever, it's willy nilly, right?                     |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=212.64)  | So just to recap, they'd be like dash dash, var name, colon, prop value, semicolon.                          |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=218.08)  | That's it.                                                                                                   |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=219.08)  | That's it.                                                                                                   |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=220.08)  | That easy to get started with.                                                                               |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=221.08)  | Now these are case sensitive idents.                                                                         |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=222.08)  | Well, I mean, they're idents.                                                                                |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=223.16)  | So idents are case sensitive, just like at keyframe names.                                                   |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=226.16)  | So you could have dash dash foo and dash dash capital F O O foo coexisting in your style                     |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=232.48)  | sheet.                                                                                                       |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=233.48)  | They are unique custom properties.                                                                           |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=235.42)  | But don't tell that to a little buddy foo foo because she's probably wondering why foo                       |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=239.92)  | is all over your style sheets.                                                                               |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=241.64)  | Anyway, that was a really bad joke.                                                                          |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=243.56)  | But if you see the double dash, I'm not even going to go into that joke more.                                |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=248.32)  | Okay, if you see the double dash, you know that the definition is coming.                                    |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=252.8)   | So okay, where can you create these variables?                                                               |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=254.8)   | You can create them in the root.                                                                             |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=256.2)   | You can create them logically or locally scoped to an element, or you can use a scoped root.                 |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=261.3)   | And so what I mean by root is, yeah, you kind of like colon root and you open up your parentheses            |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=267.04)  | or your what are the squiggly ones again?                                                                    |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=270.36)  | Curly braces, curly braces.                                                                                  |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=272.08)  | They're curly, not squiggly.                                                                                 |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=273.56)  | Duh, come on.                                                                                                |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=275.56)  | And so yeah, you can open them up and then put your styles inside of there where you                         |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=279.64)  | put your custom properties there.                                                                            |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=281.44)  | And if you use root, it's the same thing as a class, which is 10 points.                                     |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=286.92)  | And if you're looking at the sort of like scoring of points there.                                           |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=289.94)  | And so yeah, it's kind of nice if you're writing them in root, you just should know that you're              |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=292.56)  | giving them a little bit more specificity than if you were using star, for example.                          |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=296.46)  | And you can also locally scope them to a button.                                                             |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=298.42)  | So maybe you have these global custom properties, and then you have these local custom properties            |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=301.92)  | that only this button cares about, you know, button background, color thing or whatever.                     |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=307.08)  | So you can scope them there.                                                                                 |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=308.56)  | And then you could also scope your root.                                                                     |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=310.2)   | So this is nice if you're making a theming or you can have a dark theme on your colon                        |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=314.0)   | root.                                                                                                        |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=315.0)   | And so you're kind of combining classes or attributes on your HTML tag with that root                        |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=318.52)  | tag.                                                                                                         |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=319.52)  | And then you can sort of pivot all your colors in one spot.                                                  |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=321.28)  | So there's lots of ways to do it.                                                                            |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=322.88)  | You can go local or global.                                                                                  |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=325.0)   | It's on you.                                                                                                 |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=326.0)   | You can name them however you want.                                                                          |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=328.32)  | That's the brief intro of like creating them.                                                                |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=330.76)  | Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of ways you can create them.                                                     |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=332.8)   | You could also call certain custom properties from others.                                                   |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=337.24)  | So you can like kind of chain them.                                                                          |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=339.8)   | And you can also do this in JavaScript.                                                                      |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=341.6)   | So putting this declaration CSS is one place, but a great use for these custom properties                    |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=349.28)  | is the dynamic aspect of them.                                                                               |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=351.8)   | So you can write these as variables, match those throughout your UI for color values,                        |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=357.8)   | spacing, sizing, et cetera.                                                                                  |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=359.48)  | But then you can also adjust them as you are interacting with your UI.                                       |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=364.08)  | So you could set the value in your CSS, like you have a border and a header that both use                    |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=368.72)  | color primary, and then when something happens, we can update that to a different color.                     |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=372.76)  | And you can do that in your CSS or your JavaScript.                                                          |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=375.6)   | So if you wanted to set these in your JavaScript, you could do style.setproperty.                            |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=380.16)  | And that within that is going to take two values, the variable name and the property                         |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=384.68)  | value.                                                                                                       |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=385.86)  | So you could do something like document.documentElement.style.setproperty and then give it a name and value. |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=392.68)  | And this would be setting the value in the HTML root, so the style attribute.                                |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=396.22)  | And so that's the 10 points of specificity where you have your global custom property                        |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=400.52)  | styles.                                                                                                      |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=401.52)  | Usually you do document.documentElement there, but you can also set this more locally, just                  |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=406.36)  | like with CSS, you could set it more locally within an element.                                              |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=410.32)  | You can do this in JavaScript.                                                                               |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=411.88)  | So instead of document.documentElement, you can do something like document.querySelector                     |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=417.24)  | and then a specific element.                                                                                 |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=418.96)  | And then on that element, do.style.setproperty name and value.                                               |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=424.04)  | So if you wanted to set a property, like, I don't know, say you had a variable on a                          |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=429.76)  | login form, you would do document.querySelector and then maybe add a class called login form                 |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=435.08)  | or an ID of login form.                                                                                      |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=436.76)  | And then you would do the style.setproperty.                                                                 |

| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=441.64)  | Nice.                                                                                                        |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=442.64)  | I use it all the time too.                                                                                   |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=443.64)  | Like if you think about like a slider that slides from zero to 100, you can connect that                     |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=447.48)  | slider's value to like the gradient stop color or like something in a gradient just by watching              |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=454.28)  | the slider, taking the slider's value and assigning it as a custom property with that                        |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=458.48)  | JavaScript you just listed.                                                                                  |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=459.48)  | And now all of a sudden that custom property is alive and it's interactive and it's just                     |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=463.76)  | so succinct and so powerful.                                                                                 |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=466.56)  | I know.                                                                                                      |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=467.56)  | I wanted to get into that, but then I was like, oh, we're talking about adjusting later.                     |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=470.56)  | This is just how to set it.                                                                                  |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=471.82)  | So we'll get into all of those different ways that you could adjust it.                                      |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=475.2)   | But if you wanted to create a custom property, you can do it in CSS or in JavaScript and                     |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=480.16)  | you could do it globally or locally in both.                                                                 |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=482.28)  | Totally.                                                                                                     |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=483.28)  | OK, good call.                                                                                               |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=484.28)  | All right.                                                                                                   |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=485.28)  | So that's right.                                                                                             |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=486.28)  | Our next section here is on getting values.                                                                  |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=487.28)  | So sure, you set them from JS, from CSS.                                                                     |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=489.16)  | They're somewhere, they're local, they're global.                                                            |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=490.6)   | Who knows?                                                                                                   |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=491.6)   | But now you want to use them, right?                                                                         |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=493.04)  | If you just define them, that's not necessarily the same as assigning them anywhere, right?                  |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=497.28)  | You could define 100 colors.                                                                                 |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=498.28)  | And if you don't use them anywhere, if you don't get them and put them anywhere, they                        |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=502.04)  | just don't have any use.                                                                                     |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=503.6)   | OK, so you have your dash dash set.                                                                          |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=506.36)  | And then if you want to get one, you look for the var function.                                              |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=509.56)  | So this is a runtime function.                                                                               |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=510.96)  | You call the function and you pass the ident, the name of the custom property that you want.                 |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=515.52)  | And it has one cool trick up its sleeve.                                                                     |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=517.6)   | So it's simple in the beginning.                                                                             |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=519.16)  | Just say var open parentheses dash dash my custom variable name in parentheses.                              |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=523.48)  | And it will go access that and find it and return its value in real time, just like a                        |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=527.78)  | live variable right there as a value.                                                                        |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=530.16)  | But it has a trick up its sleeve where you can put a comma after that custom property                        |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=534.36)  | and specify a fallback value.                                                                                |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=537.0)   | So if you call the var function, ask for a custom property by name.                                          |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=540.4)   | And if it's not in scope or it's not found, then you say here, here's a known value and                      |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=545.32)  | it's OK to be used in this place.                                                                            |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=547.08)  | So it's kind of cool.                                                                                        |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=548.08)  | It's like a default value on a switch or something.                                                          |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=549.96)  | I feel like this is a little known CSS thing that you could send fallback values when you're                 |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=554.16)  | accessing var.                                                                                               |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=555.52)  | But it's very useful.                                                                                        |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=557.0)   | And I think not just with that switch example, but if you have a custom property that you're                 |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=561.36)  | updating, say in JavaScript, that might have a value that comes back that's maybe not formatted              |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=567.72)  | properly or isn't, you know, if you're looking for a color syntax and comes back with a number               |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=573.44)  | of NAN, like doesn't work, you could have at least some fallback.                                            |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=578.06)  | So this is like a way to error handle in CSS.                                                                |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=581.44)  | Good call.                                                                                                   |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=582.44)  | Definitely.                                                                                                  |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=583.44)  | And you can use the var function inside of other functions.                                                  |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=586.56)  | So like calc, you could call a calc function, call the var function that gets access to                      |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=590.72)  | some sort of custom property and do math on it inside of that.                                               |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=593.76)  | Right.                                                                                                       |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=594.76)  | It's just like other CSS functions where they nest and they because they're pure functions,                  |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=598.92)  | they're just going to return a value.                                                                        |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=600.32)  | They're flexible and malleable.                                                                              |

| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=603.16)  | Yes.                                                                                                         |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=604.16)  | And dynamic.                                                                                                 |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=605.16)  | We keep saying dynamic.                                                                                      |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=606.2)   | So now we're kind of moving on to adjusting these values.                                                    |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=609.9)   | So we kind of hinted about this, but there are a few ways to adjust custom properties                        |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=614.56)  | because they're dynamic.                                                                                     |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=615.56)  | So you can do this in CSS.                                                                                   |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=620.28)  | You can do this with specificity in CSS, so overriding values or with pseudo classes,                        |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=626.84)  | or you can do it in JavaScript with the style.setproperty.                                                   |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=629.36)  | So let's quickly talk about specificity.                                                                     |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=631.88)  | You can update custom property values that have a more local scope.                                          |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=634.8)   | So if you wanted to do something like set a global primary theme color, you could set                        |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=639.48)  | a color primary on the roots and then you could rewrite that for more specific elements.                     |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=644.92)  | So if say you had a card and you wanted to rewrite what the color primary is for that                        |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=649.92)  | specific card, you don't have to change all the CSS for that card.                                           |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=653.0)   | So you can use global things like if all of your borders or all of your H1s had the color                    |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=658.08)  | of color primary, you don't have to update that color every place.                                           |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=661.28)  | You would just update what color primary is in that more specific scope.                                     |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=665.12)  | So the way to do that is just by updating that color value or that custom property value                     |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=670.88)  | inside of that element, just like any other CSS property value pair.                                         |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=675.12)  | So you would do dash dash color primary and then colon the value.                                            |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=679.44)  | So instead of putting it in your root, you're putting it inside of an element.                               |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=682.8)   | So for example, you could do like in yellow card, you can update color primary to yellow                     |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=688.12)  | and then any of those base elements where it plays there using that variable will get                        |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=693.06)  | updated and they're using it by using that var and then in parentheses the dash dash                         |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=697.4)   | and that's getting, that's the getter.                                                                       |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=699.84)  | You can also update values for pseudo classes, like if you have a hover state, a focus state,                |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=705.64)  | anything that you would otherwise be able to style within CSS and you can also update                        |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=710.86)  | these within CSS animations, within key frames.                                                              |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=713.52)  | So you can use key frames solely to update custom properties and then not have to adjust                     |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=718.88)  | where those are set as a baseline, which could be really great for if you have a big transformation          |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=724.28)  | or if you have other values that you want to set.                                                            |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=728.7)   | And a beautiful thing about custom properties is because they can be fragments, because                      |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=733.88)  | they could be any sort of string, you could put them within other, I guess, bigger structures.               |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=743.1)   | So for example, if you had like an HSL color, you could set just the hue or just the saturation              |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=749.44)  | or just the lightness to a custom property value and then you could update any of those                      |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=755.32)  | individually with either user feedback, like sliders, or even you could write some logic                     |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=760.72)  | in JavaScript to update the hue value based on where the X position of the mouse is on                       |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=766.48)  | the page.                                                                                                    |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=767.48)  | So if you did like a document element dot style dot set property in the root and you                         |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=775.08)  | had just like the whole body's background color pulling from that global color value                         |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=779.92)  | and within that color value you had like a hue variable, you could set like background                       |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=785.3)   | color HSL and then in the HSL declaration var dash dash hue var, so the hue variable,                        |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=792.8)   | then you'd be able to access just the hue and you could set that to anything.                                |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=796.16)  | So like a range slider or mouse position or any other kind of interaction.                                   |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=801.12)  | Like say you have a store and you have logic that says that you're logged in or that you've                  |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=806.0)   | bought something that's added to cart.                                                                       |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=807.72)  | You could change a bunch of styles about any part of your page without having to write                       |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=812.32)  | out all these styles again in JavaScript.                                                                    |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=814.48)  | You are just updating the values.                                                                            |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=817.12)  | So I think that's pretty cool.                                                                               |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=818.68)  | It is super cool.                                                                                            |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=819.96)  | I think of them sometimes like a scalpel where, you know, we're just making the most tiny                    |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=824.64)  | incision that we can and we're adding this like super dynamic real time chunk and you're                     |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=830.28)  | like, ha ha, this color has no idea that it's hue.                                                           |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=834.76)  | It's just given a dynamic, because that's just been our fun, been given a dynamic variable                   |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=840.04)  | to just be updated and CSS is so reactive and so real time that it's like, oh, oh, my                        |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=845.84)  | color changed.                                                                                               |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=846.84)  | I got to go repaint.                                                                                         |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=847.84)  | Oh, my color changed again.                                                                                  |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=848.84)  | I got to repaint and it doesn't really know or care who's changing it.                                       |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=851.0)   | It's just like the colors changed and my values changed.                                                     |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=854.24)  | It's just like we get so much for free and custom properties really do sort of unlock                        |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=857.92)  | this targeted, interactive and powerful ability to manage tiny atoms that are dynamic.                       |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=866.34)  | So okay, anyway, let's talk about app property next, all right, because we've set them, we've                |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=873.18)  | got them, we've adjusted them, but how do we sort of like give them a little bit more,                       |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=879.04)  | you know, structure?                                                                                         |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=880.04)  | Yeah, we want to sort of prevent errors.                                                                     |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=881.7)   | We want to make sure that there are fallbacks and sort of like kind of create more of a                      |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=885.08)  | user friendly access to these.                                                                               |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=887.68)  | And so that's where app property, at least this is part of what app property does is                         |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=891.4)   | it gives you those powers.                                                                                   |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=892.4)   | So it's part of the Houdini API and we did an episode of this on an episode 26 on properties                 |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=897.2)   | and values API, and it expands on custom properties even further beyond the name value pairing               |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=903.0)   | and reduces the willy-nilliness, right?                                                                      |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=905.46)  | This is what we're going to do is we're going to give semantic structure to it by giving                     |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=908.2)   | it a type of syntax that this custom property can only have.                                                 |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=912.04)  | So when you make a custom property, it can be willy-nilly anything, but if you make an                       |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=916.04)  | app property, it's required that you specify what kind of syntax is this going to be?                        |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=919.96)  | Is this going to be a percentage, an angle, and it must stay that way the whole time,                        |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=924.7)   | unless you specify that it can be multiple syntax types, which anyway, we're a custom                        |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=928.32)  | identifier or a custom ID, right?                                                                            |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=930.64)  | So there's exceptions.                                                                                       |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=931.64)  | And if you want to learn more about those, definitely check that episode out.                                |
| [15:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=933.84)  | But yeah, you can give this a structure.                                                                     |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=935.12)  | You say, no, expect an angle here and you can specify whether or not this inherits,                          |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=940.06)  | and you can provide a fallback value right there in the initial creation of it.                              |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=943.64)  | So you're sort of like setting this variable up with a bunch of guardrails at the beginning                  |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=948.4)   | to sort of help it get integrated into the browser engine and help it sort of user facing                    |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=953.16)  | error handling.                                                                                              |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=954.16)  | It unlocks interpolation and other sort of really cool Houdini integrations.                                 |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=958.08)  | Do you want to tell us more about the Houdini stuff?                                                         |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=960.24)  | Yeah.                                                                                                        |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=961.24)  | So with app property, again, check out episode 26, but there are two ways to write custom                    |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=966.6)   | properties with Houdini with this app property.                                                              |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=969.24)  | And I like to think of this as just like, you know, CSS custom properties plus plus                          |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=972.76)  | as Adam said, it gives you superpowers.                                                                      |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=974.48)  | It lets you have more syntax, allow fallback values that are inherent to that declaration                    |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=980.48)  | itself.                                                                                                      |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=981.48)  | So you don't have to write the fallback every time you declare the variable.                                 |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=984.0)   | So it trickles out really, really cool.                                                                      |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=987.44)  | So the first way to do this was through register property in JavaScript.                                     |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=991.66)  | And more recently, there is a supported app property rule in CSS.                                            |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=996.24)  | So if you wanted to register it in JavaScript, you would do CSS dot register property.                       |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1002.24) | So it's on the CSS interface.                                                                                |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1004.04) | And then within that, you would input an object which has a name, a syntax, an initial value                 |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1010.76) | and inherits if it's true or false, if it inherits or not.                                                   |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1013.98) | So the name that would have the double dash and then the name of the custom property has                     |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1018.56) | to have that double dash.                                                                                    |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1019.8)  | The syntax, as I mentioned, it could be, you know, percentage, angle, color.                                 |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1023.84) | There are a wide variety of syntaxes.                                                                        |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1026.84) | Initial value when you're writing in JavaScript is camel case.                                               |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1029.84) | And then when you write it in CSS, it is snake case.                                                         |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1032.4)  | So that's like a fun little thing, asterisk there.                                                           |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1035.42) | So yeah, you can have your initial value, your fallback value and then if it inherits.                       |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1039.12) | And not all these are required.                                                                              |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1041.42) | So you don't have to say if it inherits or not.                                                              |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1043.88) | I think you just can have like an initial value.                                                             |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1046.92) | But it's good to have all of it.                                                                             |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1048.0)  | I think it's good to be complete.                                                                            |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1049.96) | And so then in Chromium 85, App Property landed, which now allows you to write CSS custom properties,        |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1058.44) | Houdini custom properties in CSS.                                                                            |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1062.08) | So you don't even have to have a separate JavaScript file.                                                   |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1064.44) | You can just keep it all together.                                                                           |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1066.04) | And so here you would do App Property and then the name.                                                     |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1069.72) | So like dash dash my color.                                                                                  |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1072.16) | And then you'd have the CSS declaration with the syntax, which in quotes you would have.                     |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1077.48) | And then for the syntax you have to have carets on either side.                                              |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1080.04) | So you could do percentage, initial dash value.                                                              |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1083.02) | And then here would be the initial value and then inherits, true or false.                                   |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1087.72) | So I think that App Property is awesome.                                                                     |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1090.2)  | I prefer to write things in my CSS where I can.                                                              |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1092.88) | You know fewer dependencies, fewer things to manage.                                                         |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1094.36) | This is where all my other property values are.                                                              |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1096.72) | And then you can update values and they interpolate.                                                         |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1099.96) | And you can do cool things like animated gradients with percentages or colors.                               |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1104.88) | Because as we mentioned earlier, you can write a part of a larger declaration by using custom                |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1111.6)  | properties.                                                                                                  |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1112.6)  | And a gradient is interpreted as an image.                                                                   |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1115.76) | But it also is a function that allows for multiple values within it.                                         |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1119.08) | And when you have a value within it that can interpolate because it has a syntax, you can                    |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1123.96) | attack sort of with that scalpel just that bit that you want to interpolate and change.                      |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1129.78) | And it allows for us to have a lot more control over some of these larger bits of CSS by having              |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1137.6)  | that very scoped view into it.                                                                               |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1141.68) | So nice.                                                                                                     |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1142.68) | It's like remember when Angular 1 came out and everyone was so stoked on the concept                         |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1147.64) | of like a variable changed and my view updated for free.                                                     |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1151.96) | That's what we get with CSS variables for free.                                                              |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1155.28) | There's so much invalidation that has to happen.                                                             |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1157.32) | Because yeah, just like you're talking there, it's an image.                                                 |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1159.24) | But it was.                                                                                                  |

| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1168.48) | And it's just CSS is so amazing, so powerful.                                                                |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1171.28) | I bet that development cycle internally for browsers had to be a lot of work to get these                    |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1178.16) | in there.                                                                                                    |

| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1181.6)  | All right.                                                                                                   |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1182.6)  | So final remarks and stuff about custom properties because that's the essentials.                            |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1186.8)  | That essentially gives you the essentials.                                                                   |

| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1191.36) | But there's all sorts of fringe and edge cases.                                                              |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1193.92) | Right at CSS, this is a humongous surface area of API.                                                       |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1197.16) | And this one reactive concept can really impact lots of areas.                                               |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1201.12) | So the first one I want to talk about is a it's not funny, but it sounds like it should                      |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1205.1)  | be funny.                                                                                                    |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1206.1)  | It's the billion laughs attack.                                                                              |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1207.52) | And really no one's laughing if you if there's a billion laughs happening here.                              |
| [20:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1211.32) | But essentially, you can make a like dash dash prop one and then dash dash prop two                          |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1216.4)  | is equal to dash dash prop one and then dash dash prop three is equal to dash dash prop                      |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1220.8)  | two, which is equal to anyway.                                                                               |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1222.04) | So you can create this sort of nested structure.                                                             |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1224.48) | And by Prop 30, you can create a billion instances of your custom property in CSS's memory.                  |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1231.08) | And so that's just by hand.                                                                                  |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1232.48) | In 30 lines of CSS, you can hack a browser and crash it until they edited the spec and                       |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1237.36) | said, we're going to limit that.                                                                             |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1238.92) | So we're going to do what we can to make sure that CSS variables can only be nested so many                  |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1243.32) | times.                                                                                                       |

| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1255.64) | Maybe make a thousand bucks from Chrome.                                                                     |

| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1258.16) | So another thing to note is that custom properties are not reset by doing something like all                 |
| [21:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1263.8)  | colon unset.                                                                                                 |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1264.8)  | So the all property allows for you to basically reset a bunch of properties so that you could                |

| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1315.72) | They can take that custom property value and evaluate it and turn it into something.                         |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1322.08) | Yeah, you can eval with Houdini.                                                                             |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1324.72) | Yeah, right?                                                                                                 |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1325.72) | The power of willy nilly.                                                                                    |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1327.2)  | So CSS is just in there willy nilly making definitions kind of just like laying out lines                    |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1331.78) | of code for other engines to execute.                                                                        |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1335.18) | And they're just stashed silently in these custom properties.                                                |
| [22:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1338.48) | Yeah, that's actually really funny because I when this first came out, I remember I was                      |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1342.96) | doing a lot more like weird experimental things with it.                                                     |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1345.64) | And evaluating a statement within a custom property is a thing that you can do.                              |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1350.28) | And that is just like so weird.                                                                              |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1352.04) | It is weird.                                                                                                 |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1353.04) | It's not really practical, but it's funny.                                                                   |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1356.78) | So another thing about like kind of like all inset, you know, initial values, the initial                    |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1361.72) | value.                                                                                                       |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1362.72) | So initial is what I'm talking about.                                                                        |
| [22:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1364.88) | The initial value of a custom property is a guaranteed invalid value.                                        |
| [22:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1369.3)  | So it would be like if you used var with an empty statement, a value needs to come back                      |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1375.78) | and its default is a guaranteed invalid value.                                                               |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1378.6)  | So you can't really use initial there.                                                                       |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1381.76) | It's true.                                                                                                   |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1382.76) | And it does.                                                                                                 |
| [23:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1383.76) | It sounds so arbitrary that there's a guaranteed invalid value.                                              |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1387.2)  | But I mean, everything in CSS is typed.                                                                      |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1389.22) | So it's not like you can just return null.                                                                   |
| [23:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1391.6)  | Like it's a typed, it's like a known invalid.                                                                |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1394.4)  | Anyway, so yeah, it's guaranteed invalid.                                                                    |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1396.68) | And what it can be used for, though, is these people are like hacking these to make switch                   |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1402.0)  | type behaviors or space toggles.                                                                             |
| [23:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1404.44) | So in your custom properties.                                                                                |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1406.8)  | So see the show notes for libraries and folks who are hacking custom properties to make                      |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1410.32) | switches because they're leaning into this guaranteed invalid value and sort of these                        |
| [23:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1415.26) | strategic edge cases of how custom properties behave when they're empty or when they have                    |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1420.08) | a space or yeah, it gets really niche and there's kind of some interesting stuff in                          |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1424.92) | there.                                                                                                       |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1425.92) | So the thing with custom properties is be careful.                                                           |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1427.88) | You can create cyclical dependencies.                                                                        |
| [23:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1430.8)  | So let's say it's also kind of hard to do.                                                                   |
| [23:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1433.04) | You can only do it if you do it in the same block because otherwise, anyway, whatever,                       |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1437.64) | you can go research some more.                                                                               |
| [23:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1438.64) | But it just be something like you have like button dash dash var a is equal to dash dash                     |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1444.4)  | var b.                                                                                                       |
| [24:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1445.4)  | And then next line you have dash dash var b is equal to dash dash var a.                                     |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1449.24) | And it's like, well, those are never going to resolve are they?                                              |
| [24:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1453.08) | Yeah.                                                                                                        |
| [24:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1454.08) | Yeah.                                                                                                        |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1455.08) | So another like sort of error handling thing is custom properties are loosely declared                       |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1459.12) | at declaration time, but the error handling isn't actually done until they're used.                          |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1463.44) | So until they're used in some kind of like property value pair for it to actually analyze                    |
| [24:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1469.52) | if it can be if it's true or if there's an error there, if it can be handled or if not                       |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1475.64) | at that time.                                                                                                |
| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1476.64) | Good call.                                                                                                   |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1477.64) | And that kind of goes into this next tip, too, which is computed value time can get                          |
| [24:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1480.52) | you as you may think a custom property change will propagate upwards, but it doesn't.                        |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1484.96) | Or maybe you think it's going to propagate laterally or anyway, there's like a relationship                  |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1489.48) | here about computed value time.                                                                              |
| [24:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1491.6)  | And you might be left wondering why your value didn't update.                                                |
| [24:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1493.94) | And it's usually because you changed a custom property lower or with higher specificity                      |
| [24:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1498.48) | than where it was defined.                                                                                   |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1499.88) | And there's sort of like this anyway, there's a computed time value scenario.                                |
| [25:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1504.88) | We might even just like have to do a show on it because it's well, this makes sense                          |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1507.64) | to me because with custom properties, you can declare a color primary red and you can                        |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1512.6)  | use color primary red as a color value, but you can also do like margin and then var color                   |
| [25:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1518.22) | primary.                                                                                                     |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1519.22) | And that is invalid.                                                                                         |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1521.42) | But where you use color, color primary is valid.                                                             |
| [25:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1524.72) | So it really depends on where you're using it.                                                               |
| [25:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1526.74) | It wouldn't make sense to do the error handling at the top level because there's something                   |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1529.68) | to error handle yet.                                                                                         |
| [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1531.42) | You just set it.                                                                                             |
| [25:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1532.42) | Nice.                                                                                                        |
| [25:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1533.42) | Makes sense.                                                                                                 |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1534.42) | Yep.                                                                                                         |
| [25:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1535.42) | One last thing that's kind of funny, Adam just sent this to me before we recorded today,                     |
| [25:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1538.48) | is that dash dash in itself is a valid custom property name.                                                 |
| [25:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1543.12) | You could technically write a custom property that's just dash dash colon and then the value.                |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1549.28) | This is supposed to be reserved for CSS to use in the future, but apparently our browsers                    |
| [25:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1553.12) | haven't updated the implementation yet.                                                                      |
| [25:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1554.78) | So it works today if you try it.                                                                             |
| [25:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1557.16) | Yeah.                                                                                                        |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1558.16) | It's really popular for use with code golfing where folks are trying to write the least                      |
| [26:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1561.32) | amount of code to take out these CSS challenges.                                                             |
| [26:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1564.2)  | And so they're shaving characters off of their CSS deliverables by leveraging this little                    |
| [26:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1570.64) | trick.                                                                                                       |
| [26:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1571.64) | That is really funny.                                                                                        |

| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1575.4)  | I love talking about custom properties.                                                                      |
| [26:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1576.72) | This is definitely something that I have used in every single project I've ever worked on                    |
| [26:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1582.56) | since they really were a thing that you can use cross browser.                                               |
| [26:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NUzPqu3NcA8OkxdYJkiU4?&t=1587.44) | Something that I can't live without and something that I think is really great to get a good                 |
