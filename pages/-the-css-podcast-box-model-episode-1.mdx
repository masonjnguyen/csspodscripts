| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=17.2)   | I'm Una Kravitz.                                                                                    |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=18.2)   | And I'm Adam Argyle.                                                                                |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=19.6)   | And today we're talking about the box model.                                                        |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=21.6)   | The box model!                                                                                      |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=22.98)  | Like the most fundamental thing in CSS, right?                                                      |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=25.16)  | It's just little boxes.                                                                             |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=26.16)  | We'll move the little boxes around the screen.                                                      |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=27.76)  | Our job is so easy, right?                                                                          |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=29.04)  | Oh, the complexity behind those little boxes.                                                       |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=32.44)  | There's so much complexity.                                                                         |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=34.04)  | Where does it start?                                                                                |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=35.04)  | Where does the complexity start, Una?                                                               |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=36.04)  | I mean, it's just a box.                                                                            |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=37.24)  | It is a box, but the box really starts with the content that lives inside of that box.              |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=41.96)  | So we can kick it off by talking about how that content affects the rest of the box by              |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=45.88)  | talking about intrinsic and extrinsic sizing.                                                       |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=48.84)  | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                         |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=49.84)  | This is one of my favorite topics, and this is stupid.                                              |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=51.6)   | I'll probably say that many times on this show, but intrinsic and extrinsic, I feel,                |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=55.12)  | is insanely core to how you think about your layouts.                                               |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=58.82)  | If your layouts are more extrinsic, I feel like it's coming from print, where you would             |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=63.36)  | make a box for your text to go, and then you'd paste some text inside.                              |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=66.5)   | But intrinsic, the web, has this alternative thing where you can just put a box around              |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=71.88)  | the text, and then the text can change languages.                                                   |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=74.24)  | Anyway, yeah.                                                                                       |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=75.24)  | Yes.                                                                                                |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=76.24)  | Before we get into it, let's define what intrinsic and extrinsic actually mean with an example      |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=80.72)  | on the web.                                                                                         |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=81.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=82.72)  | So what is an intrinsic layout versus an extrinsic layout if you had an example of, say, a photo    |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=86.76)  | of a flower?                                                                                        |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=87.76)  | Yeah, so if we have a photo of a flower, if I make a box and I say, here's, it's 200 pixels         |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=92.88)  | by 200 pixels, and then I take an image that maybe is landscape or 4 by 3, and I put that           |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=98.28)  | image into the box, that's an extrinsic layout.                                                     |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=101.24) | The box was predefined, and then I put content in it, and that content has to fit to the            |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=106.04) | box.                                                                                                |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=107.04) | So you can also tell that content how to fit.                                                       |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=109.46) | You can tell that content if you want it to span the whole box, if you want it to fit               |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=113.18) | within the box.                                                                                     |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=114.18) | That's a whole other show, but what the concept is here is that we are setting the content          |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=118.4)  | box size.                                                                                           |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=119.4)  | Yes, we're explicitly setting the content box size and then saying, hey, content, you               |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=123.92) | must fit into my zone, which works in a lot of cases.                                               |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=127.8)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=128.8)  | And then what about this intrinsic sizing?                                                          |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=131.12) | Intrinsic is more like asking the content how much space does it need?                              |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=135.62) | And it's like having a box that is shrink wrapped is a fun way to think about it.                   |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=139.48) | And I also like to think about it's shrink wrapped and that text can change and that                |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=144.24) | box will also change.                                                                               |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=145.64) | So it's a very dynamic box that looks into itself to discover what its sizing that it               |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=151.32) | needs to have.                                                                                      |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=152.32) | So the base image size of that flower would then affect the content size.                           |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=156.92) | And as you mentioned, if we have text here, if it's a paragraph, the bigger or smaller              |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=160.84) | that paragraph is, would affect the actual size of that content box.                                |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=164.2)  | Yep.                                                                                                |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=165.2)  | Cool.                                                                                               |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=166.2)  | So that's the first part of the box model, the content that lives in that element.                  |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=171.52) | And now what is the second layer from inside of the content out?                                    |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=176.68) | Let's just say we have an extrinsic box that we're working with right now.                          |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=180.04) | It's 200 pixels by 200 pixels and we'll just say the word CSS inside of it and we're going          |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=184.72) | to center the text vertically and horizontally.                                                     |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=187.2)  | So hopefully you have like a box that's bigger than the text and the text is inside.                |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=191.36) | So that's our content box.                                                                          |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=193.2)  | Outside of the content box is the padding box.                                                      |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=196.0)  | This is where we would say it needs this much from the edge of where it's going to be soon.         |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=200.6)  | We're going to talk about the border, but we're not quite to the border yet, but the                |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=203.36) | padding box is the one just outside of the content.                                                 |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=206.1)  | So the padding lives between the content itself and that edge up to the border, like you mentioned. |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=212.24) | And then we have this border box and the border is a box because the border could be as thin        |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=216.44) | as one pixel or as thick as a million pixels.                                                       |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=219.6)  | I've never seen that, but you know, we're exploring new things in the web today.                    |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=223.44) | The border box itself can contain images.                                                           |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=226.3)  | You can have a border image.                                                                        |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=227.9)  | So after we have this padding box, we then have the border box and the border box does              |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=232.56) | affect the size of this element.                                                                    |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=234.2)  | It affects the geometric placement on the page, the dimensions of this element.                     |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=239.2)  | But there's also the outline and the box shadow and those elements don't actually affect the        |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=245.36) | physical geometric size of that element.                                                            |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=248.16) | Yeah, they're painted.                                                                              |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=249.52) | So while we're talking about the box model and we're talking about a border box, these              |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=253.64) | are nice because they not only can create additional space, but they can be additionally            |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=258.2)  | painted.                                                                                            |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=259.4)  | And so this is why border is kind of interesting, right?                                            |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=261.24) | You had border image and other things you listed.                                                   |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=263.4)  | That's a cool opportunity to paint a part of the box.                                               |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=267.2)  | And outside of that border box, you mentioned outline and box shadow.                               |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=270.0)  | Those are generally outside of that box and those are only painted.                                 |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=273.56) | No matter how big or how small you make an outline or box shadow, you'll never change               |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=276.92) | the size of that box.                                                                               |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=278.32) | That box is only being sized by, well, its content, its padding and the border.                     |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=283.24) | So it's kind of interesting to separate things that are being painted on the box versus things      |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=287.36) | that are changing the box's dimensions, right?                                                      |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=289.88) | All this little stuff is getting so complex so fast.                                                |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=292.4)  | Yeah, and I think that it's also an interesting point because something that we commonly see        |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=297.04) | when people debug CSS is people will add a red border around elements.                              |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=301.68) | I do that all the time.                                                                             |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=303.16) | But it's important to note that adding a border will affect the size of that element.               |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=307.22) | So as you're doing that, your elements might shift on the page, whereas adding an outline           |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=311.4)  | would not change the placement of those elements on the page.                                       |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=315.08) | And the same thing with box shadow.                                                                 |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=316.16) | You could have a thousand box shadows on an element if you want.                                    |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=319.24) | They just are a comma separated list and that element itself will always retain its geometric       |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=324.72) | placement on the page.                                                                              |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=326.28) | Yep, and that's really nice.                                                                        |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=327.52) | So then, all right, so we've got a box.                                                             |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=329.32) | There's the word CSS inside of it.                                                                  |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=331.02) | It's a white box.                                                                                   |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=332.02) | I've added some padding so that there's a space around my content.                                  |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=335.24) | I have a black border and now how do I push away from my border?                                    |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=339.9)  | Is there another box in this hold?                                                                  |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=341.32) | There is another box and that is the margin.                                                        |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=343.96) | So this margin box is what actually separates your element from other elements and allows           |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=348.08) | it to breathe, gives it some white space.                                                           |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=350.52) | It's something that is a part of the box model of that element because that element owns            |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=355.26) | that margin, but it also is not a part of the content itself.                                       |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=360.4)  | It is affected by the content.                                                                      |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=361.6)  | It's affected by the size of the content, the padding, and the border, but it is separate           |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=365.56) | of that in the sense that it creates space between elements.                                        |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=368.4)  | Now this is also important to note because when you're applying things like a grid gap,             |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=372.8)  | the grid gap is not owned by every individual element.                                              |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=375.64) | It's owned by the parent grid, whereas the margin is owned by every individual element.             |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=380.34) | I love that you broke that down, like who owns that spacing?                                        |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=383.96) | That's really nice.                                                                                 |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=384.96) | And I just want to recap it because it's fun.                                                       |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=386.58) | We've got CSS in the center.                                                                        |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=388.54) | We have a white box that has a sufficient amount of padding with a black border and                 |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=392.1)  | has a sufficient amount of margin.                                                                  |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=394.04) | That's essentially the box model.                                                                   |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=395.42) | So if you can visualize about four boxes layering and getting larger as they go out, that's         |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=400.8)  | ultimately what the browser uses to then associate it with other boxes and to lay these boxes       |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=406.5)  | out in total altogether.                                                                            |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=408.06) | And we will have a link to a code pen that Adam has provided to give you a better understanding     |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=411.98) | and visualization of this that you can also go and play with.                                       |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=414.84) | I do want to comment and note that if you are getting started with CSS and applying                 |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=420.5)  | elements on your page, you may notice that some elements already have spacing applied               |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=425.28) | to them.                                                                                            |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=426.42) | For example, if you have an unordered list with list items inside of that, you see this             |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=431.38) | padding on the left side of your list if you're in a left to right language or a right to           |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=435.94) | left language would be on the opposite the right side.                                              |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=438.86) | And you might be wondering where is this coming from?                                               |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=441.08) | It's coming from the user agent style sheets that ship with browsers like Chrome and Firefox        |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=446.22) | and Microsoft Edge.                                                                                 |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=447.22) | Yep, the user agent style sheet will change the way that those elements and their box               |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=451.46) | model behaves in the browser per browser.                                                           |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=454.1)  | It's a good point to bring that up.                                                                 |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=455.22) | If you don't want that additional spacing, you can use a normalized or a reset CSS file.            |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=460.54) | But this user agent style sheet is also the reason why you're seeing headline one bigger            |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=464.58) | than headline two and three.                                                                        |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=466.18) | It is something that browser provides as a base styling for a web page that has no additional       |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=471.22) | CSS on top of it.                                                                                   |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=472.9)  | But let's go back to that code pen because there is a really interesting thing that you're          |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=477.34) | pointing out to me as we were preparing for the show, and that's scroll bars.                       |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=481.86) | Where do the scroll bars live?                                                                      |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=483.06) | Yeah, they're weird and they're all dynamic too.                                                    |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=485.14) | Like each platform kind of handles them different.                                                  |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=487.02) | There's platform settings.                                                                          |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=488.02) | It's like as a user, I can say I want to always see scroll bars or I want them to overlay.          |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=493.28) | So sometimes you can see there's like a gutter that gets created for the scroll bar and sometimes   |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=497.3)  | not.                                                                                                |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=498.3)  | And then even in CSS, we have the ability to say like overflow visible or overflow scroll           |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=503.26) | and we can say whether or not we want the scroll bar to be visible and take up space                |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=507.5)  | or not.                                                                                             |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=508.5)  | So the long story short is that scroll bars consume the same space as the padding box,              |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=512.98) | which starts to make sense as you think it out a little bit.                                        |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=515.1)  | But yeah, initially when you get asked the question, you're like, I don't know, is the              |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=518.7)  | scroll bar inside or outside of the border?                                                         |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=520.58) | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=521.58) | That's exactly how I react.                                                                         |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=522.58) | I didn't think about it.                                                                            |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=523.58) | It makes sense though.                                                                              |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=524.58) | They do live in the padding box, which is weird because they do create that additional              |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=527.7)  | space, but they live inside that border and you probably want to have everything contained          |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=530.9)  | within the border that's like the outside frame of your element, which also lives inside            |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=536.34) | the outline of box shadows.                                                                         |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=537.62) | So lots of asterisks, lots of complexity to the box model, unexpected complexity.                   |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=543.54) | And it's important to understand the box model when you are doing things like clipping and          |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=547.58) | masking and doing more advanced CSS.                                                                |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=550.06) | For example, with the background clip property, you can background clip to the content box,         |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=554.46) | the padding box or the border box.                                                                  |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=556.98) | And hopefully this podcast helps you understand what the difference is between all of those.        |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=561.7)  | And if not, check out that code pen because it is a great visualization of the concepts             |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=565.3)  | we talked about today.                                                                              |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=566.3)  | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=567.3)  | I like that you brought up photo frame because I like to think about the box model in a couple      |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=570.38) | of fun metaphor ways and a photo frame is a good way because your content is sort of                |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=574.26) | the image in the center.                                                                            |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=575.9)  | Padding is like, what do you call it when you have a photo frame and it has the, it's               |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=579.34) | just like padding.                                                                                  |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=580.34) | I know exactly what you're talking about.                                                           |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=581.98) | You like cut a frame that's inside of the actual photo frame to give it more space.                 |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=587.06) | I can't remember the name, but this is like a common technique that artists do.                     |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=591.46) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=592.46) | Cause usually your image doesn't go right to the frame of the picture.                              |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=595.54) | There's some padding there.                                                                         |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=597.02) | Anyway, so right in this metaphor, you have an image, then you have that padding piece              |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=602.7)  | and then you have the frame of the actual photo and then margin would be like the photo             |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=607.14) | saying, I need space, I can never touch another photo frame ever.                                   |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=611.28) | You need to always keep me four inches from every other photo frame.                                |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=614.38) | And that's a cool model.                                                                            |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=615.58) | Yes.                                                                                                |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=616.58) | Wait, I like this.                                                                                  |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=617.58) | So building on top of this, you've got that padding, which is that space.                           |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=619.82) | You have the border, which is the frame.                                                            |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=621.38) | You have the outline, which could be the place that you place it on the wall.                       |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=625.28) | If you were to lay out like a gallery view, you'd outline where you place it and the box            |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=630.7)  | shadow is a physical shadow from the light that doesn't actually affect, you know, the              |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=635.66) | content itself, but it is there and you could have different light casting, different types         |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=639.3)  | of shadows.                                                                                         |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=640.38) | And then the margin is the space between those pictures on your wall in the gallery.                |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=646.02) | That's between those elements.                                                                      |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=648.14) | I like this analogy.                                                                                |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=649.14) | Oh, we have a helper and it's called a mat.                                                         |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=653.14) | It's a photo mat.                                                                                   |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=654.38) | A photo mat.                                                                                        |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=655.38) | That's the word for padding.                                                                        |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=656.38) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=657.38) | Oh, that's so funny.                                                                                |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1j2EhMoMkbiuC9LkrLG1gX?&t=659.68) | Great visual though.                                                                                |
