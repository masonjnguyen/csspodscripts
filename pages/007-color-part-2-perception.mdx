| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=17.36)   | In today's episode, we're going to go over how users perceive color and what that means              |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=21.0)    | for us as web developers.                                                                            |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=22.94)   | Color isn't just what we define in our UI.                                                           |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=25.28)   | It's what our users perceive and what they see.                                                      |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=27.68)   | So today we're talking about screen gamut differences, biological considerations, accessibility,     |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=32.6)    | and more.                                                                                            |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=33.6)    | We'll answer questions like, what is gamut and luminosity?                                           |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=36.8)    | How does that differ from lightness?                                                                 |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=38.36)   | Does it?                                                                                             |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=39.36)   | What's color contrast?                                                                               |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=40.36)   | What are color spaces and which should you be using?                                                 |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=43.16)   | This is a two-part episode, so if you missed part one about color usage, make sure to go             |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=47.84)   | back and check that out to get some context into what color syntaxes are and what's available        |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=52.12)   | and how to use them.                                                                                 |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=53.12)   | But let's kick off this chat about color perception.                                                 |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=56.02)   | What you got, Yuna?                                                                                  |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=57.02)   | Well, okay, when you want your users to see a brand color, say that brand color is red,              |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=61.24)   | you're using pure red, that's RGB 25500 to display your colors.                                      |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=66.32)   | Do you know that not all screens will see the same exact results?                                    |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=70.2)    | I'm sure that you've experienced this yourself over the years, whether it's on a projector,          |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=73.64)   | a Kindle, or old monitor.                                                                            |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=75.12)   | Well, the reason is because of the screen's color gamut.                                             |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=78.64)   | Yes, and gamut is defined as the complete range or scope of something.                               |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=82.96)   | And in the context of colors, it's how many colors you have to choose from.                          |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=86.9)    | So less gamut generally results in color clipping, where a color system looks at the requested       |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=91.76)   | color, tries to make it within the gamut, but has to chop off some of the information                |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=95.64)   | in order for it to display.                                                                          |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=97.52)   | It kind of makes sense, right?                                                                       |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=98.52)   | If it can't reach there, it can reach here, and so it'll use that.                                   |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=102.0)   | And so you'll start to see these differences across different screens.                               |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=105.02)  | And there's also scenarios where the gamut is better than what you've specified.                     |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=109.78)  | And in this case, your color might be stretched or transformed into higher quality colors            |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=114.54)  | automatically for you.                                                                               |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=115.92)  | So it can go up or down, depending on the gamut and the capability of where you're trying            |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=119.24)  | to put your color.                                                                                   |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=120.44)  | And when we're talking about hundreds or millions of colors, it's pretty daunting to think about     |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=124.76)  | gamut and color potential.                                                                           |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=126.7)   | But let's take this for example.                                                                     |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=128.28)  | You walk into a store and you see a wall of different TVs.                                           |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=131.72)  | The subtleties in browser color gamut start to become really obvious there.                          |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=136.64)  | Once they're all next to each other, right?                                                          |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=138.3)   | So on the web, the sRGB gamut is used to define most color spaces as it's the most widely            |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=144.16)  | supported on monitors.                                                                               |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=145.64)  | This is the lowest common denominator gamut range and used to be the most common that                |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=149.72)  | screens could handle displaying.                                                                     |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=151.58)  | This lets us see a subset of all possible colors, but at least it's more consistent                  |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=155.24)  | across all these different screens.                                                                  |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=156.74)  | On higher end monitors, another popular color space is Adobe RGB with a wider gamut, especially      |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=162.04)  | in the saturated blues and greens.                                                                   |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=164.02)  | So if you can visualize a layout of all visible color, sRGB would be one subset, so say one          |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=170.56)  | triangle of that color, and then this Adobe RGB would be a bigger triangle outside of                |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=176.08)  | that that sways towards these blues and greens.                                                      |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=179.34)  | There's a newer color space called P3 or DCI-P3, which many displays support these days.             |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=184.74)  | This is newer, you have higher end displays supporting this, and it's similar to Adobe               |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=188.54)  | RGB in that it extends outside of the sRGB range, but it skews more into the reds and                |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=193.98)  | yellows and leans less into those blues and greens.                                                  |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=197.18)  | The bit depth also affects the depth of visible color.                                               |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=200.24)  | So this is another big reason why those TV monitors are all displaying similar but different         |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=204.66)  | colors with various saturation shades.                                                               |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=207.38)  | When you have an 8-bit display, for example, you'll see 255 shades of red, 255 shades                |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=212.46)  | of green, and 255 shades of blue.                                                                    |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=215.74)  | In a 10-bit display, you'll see 1,023 shades of each of those color channels, totaling               |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=221.78)  | over a billion color combinations overall, making gradients appear smoother and seeing               |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=228.06)  | more colors that are visible in a range.                                                             |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=231.54)  | Your smartphone and laptop might even display different screen views to you as a user, even          |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=237.88)  | if they're rated the same exact gamma display.                                                       |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=241.0)   | You have changes in hue, saturation, and lightness that the user might have set or is set by         |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=245.02)  | default, so there's just a lot of different things that are happening here in those displays         |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=250.2)   | where your users are going to see that end color.                                                    |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=252.7)   | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=253.7)   | And I kind of want to recap that in like a little bit of a metaphor, because if you think            |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=257.02)  | about a limited gamma set as something that you could hold in your hand, like maybe a                |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=260.76)  | bad projector, like an old projector, it's got a golf ball size of colors that it can                |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=265.74)  | handle.                                                                                              |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=266.74)  | Now, we're going to deal with things in this metaphor that are circular, but think about             |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=269.86)  | things as you know, saying like in triangles and maybe even reaches where a triangle's               |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=274.14)  | one side might reach further into another color set than another.                                    |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=277.34)  | But anyway, so we have a bad projector, it's like a golf ball, and then you have a MacBook           |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=280.66)  | Air, which is like a tennis ball, so this would be like an older Air, and you have a                 |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=284.08)  | Retina MacBook, and that has like a soccer ball available of colors, and then you have               |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=288.02)  | something like a Cinebo display or like a movie theater, like when you go to a proper                |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=291.68)  | IMAX theater, and that could be anywhere from like a volleyball to like Jupiter amount of            |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=296.38)  | colors that are available.                                                                           |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=297.62)  | So kind of cool to think about gamut that way is that it is this two-dimensional or                  |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=301.58)  | three-dimensional thing that colors exist within, and it has to be supported in order                |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=306.22)  | for it to be displayed.                                                                              |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=307.22)  | So anyway, kind of cool.                                                                             |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=308.22)  | Yeah, I really like that analogy.                                                                    |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=310.74)  | When we go and give talks, sometimes the display is going to be really making our talk fade          |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=315.3)   | out in color, and sometimes if it's a really nice new display, it's even more saturated              |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=318.86)  | than we expected or that we're seeing on our screens or practicing on our laptops, so it             |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=323.3)   | really does make a difference the kind of screen that users are looking at your site                 |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=326.94)  | from.                                                                                                |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=327.94)  | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=328.94)  | So when you write a color request, say your brand red, I mentioned in the beginning, you're          |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=332.22)  | usually writing that in the sRGB color space, but that color space isn't device independent.         |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=337.94)  | You have this device dependent namespace you're asking for within that sRGB gamut.                   |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=343.86)  | The colors that you write are directly tied to the device that you intend to display it              |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=347.46)  | on.                                                                                                  |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=348.46)  | And this has some problems because you don't always have control over those devices that             |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=351.9)   | folks are using to see your colors.                                                                  |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=354.16)  | So even though you're writing within this color space, they might not see the true color             |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=357.62)  | that you're intending to visualize for them.                                                         |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=360.7)   | So what happens when there's not a match?                                                            |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=362.14)  | You get this color clamping starting to happen.                                                      |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=365.18)  | Write about your color choices being lost in translation and in conversion.                          |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=369.46)  | So a good example of like a classic device dependent color space that, by the way, will              |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=374.1)   | be available in color level four is CMYK.                                                            |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=378.16)  | So hopefully you've heard of that color before.                                                      |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=380.02)  | It's directly tied to the equipment and the inks that are available inside of that equipment.        |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=385.02)  | So device dependent very strictly.                                                                   |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=387.38)  | So it's kind of a cool example.                                                                      |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=388.9)   | And that's important because people totally write print style sheets in CSS.                         |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=392.32)  | You could even write books in CSS and make sure that what users see when they print things           |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=396.0)   | out is what you expect.                                                                              |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=397.94)  | If you're styling a design system or style guide online, you want to make sure that what             |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=402.1)   | they're printing is the true color that you're trying to showcase.                                   |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=404.82)  | Oh yeah.                                                                                             |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=405.82)  | We've all printed something and been like, that is not the blue that I saw on my screen.             |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=409.14)  | For sure.                                                                                            |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=410.14)  | Don't fear too much, though, about changes in visible color through these color spaces               |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=414.02)  | because there are color spaces that allow for device independent color application.                  |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=418.14)  | Now what does that mean, Adam?                                                                       |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=419.38)  | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=420.38)  | Device independence.                                                                                 |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=421.38)  | So this kind of came about in the early 1900s.                                                       |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=424.58)  | CIE is the most famous of them where they were trying to create these device independent             |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=428.58)  | color systems.                                                                                       |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=429.58)  | And you could think of it as like a sibling to RGB, like a brother or a sister.                      |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=434.24)  | So instead of the colors being very device relevant, they're device independent and kind             |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=438.68)  | of can have some of their own motivations because of that.                                           |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=440.96)  | So since they're not specifically tied to some hardware or some equipment, they can                  |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=445.38)  | be free and liberated a little bit and not have to be so kind of maybe number specific               |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=449.5)   | like we were seeing before.                                                                          |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=450.62)  | So this kind of sounds like Pantone colors for print, but for the web.                               |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=454.1)   | Oh, I see what you mean.                                                                             |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=455.46)  | Yeah, but maybe that's kind of what keywords are too.                                                |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=457.78)  | Keywords are like these web Pantones.                                                                |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=458.78)  | Yeah, but the idea of Pantone was if you want to get like a paint color.                             |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=463.46)  | So say you wanted to get like a Tiffany blue.                                                        |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=466.72)  | That Tiffany blue could vary, but it's a brand color.                                                |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=469.26)  | Like it's a specific color that you always want to be the same for everything.                       |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=472.14)  | Sweatshirts for, say, painting your walls for print invitations.                                     |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=478.1)   | Like that color value when it's a Pantone color, like it keeps that color value consistent.          |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=483.66)  | Interesting.                                                                                         |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=484.66)  | Yeah, I mean, I'm intrigued.                                                                         |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=486.02)  | I would like to go learn more.                                                                       |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=487.9)   | So under this CIE color space that is a sibling to RGB, we have new syntaxes and these new           |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=495.04)  | syntaxes are lab and LCH, gray and color.                                                            |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=499.7)   | You can find these in the color level four spec and I'm going to go over lab first here.             |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=504.28)  | And so again, this episode is all about perceptual colors and just like the perception of color.     |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=509.6)   | And that gets really important here with the CIE space because that's its entire goal is             |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=514.86)  | the CIE space was it's not just device independent, it's perceptually consistent.                    |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=520.82)  | And we're going to hear us kind of talk about that over and over again.                              |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=523.1)   | And we'll get into some of those examples, but like, okay, so lab is a human perception              |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=527.26)  | motivated color syntax, human perception motivated.                                                  |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=531.38)  | And what I mean by that is like the idea for perceptually uniform lightness across its               |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=535.26)  | color coordinate system.                                                                             |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=536.96)  | So we want to have the same lightness in blue, be the same lightness that we have in yellow,         |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=541.3)   | but that has to be the perceptual uniform lightness, not necessarily like the mathematical           |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=546.72)  | actual lightness like that's built into the color.                                                   |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=549.14)  | So okay, really quick example.                                                                       |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=551.18)  | HSL is not perceptually uniform, but it is mathematically uniform.                                   |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=556.18)  | Lab is perceptually uniform.                                                                         |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=558.22)  | And so what I really mean is like HSL lets me say I want a 50% light green next to a                 |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=562.78)  | 50% light gray.                                                                                      |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=564.38)  | And to my human eye, I'll perceive them as actually looking like different lightnesses.              |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=568.62)  | Like that's crazy because HSL is like, no, they're both 50%.                                         |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=571.18)  | I'm like, well, no, they're not.                                                                     |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=572.34)  | My eye is disagreeing with you.                                                                      |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=574.56)  | Now in lab, they are the same to my eye or their intent, their motivation is to be as                |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=581.04)  | close to what my eye perceives as 50%.                                                               |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=583.88)  | And this really comes out with like yellows and blues where even though they're the same             |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=587.94)  | lightness, the yellow seems much brighter than that blue does.                                       |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=590.62)  | Yeah, in some ways it's even annoying.                                                               |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=592.88)  | It's kind of like a trade off.                                                                       |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=593.88)  | There's a trade off that guy made and anyway, it's kind of fun, but it's motivated by perceptual     |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=597.52)  | uniformity so that humans can stay sane when they're managing their colors and managing              |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=602.7)   | the colors that they want to define them and codify them and the way that they see them.             |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=606.66)  | So the lab syntax, okay, this is just like HSL and RGB.                                              |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=610.02)  | You open this up by saying the three letters and then an open parenthesis.                           |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=613.5)   | So it'd be LAB parenthesis and inside of here it takes a percentage, then a number, then             |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=618.02)  | a number.                                                                                            |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=619.02)  | And if you want alpha, it'd be a slash and an alpha value.                                           |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=621.62)  | So lab as a color syntax takes a lightness percentage as its first parameter, which makes            |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=626.58)  | sense since it's motivated by lightness.                                                             |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=629.16)  | Then it takes two numbers after that.                                                                |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=631.64)  | The first A, so we have L as lightness.                                                              |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=634.22)  | A is not actually an acronym for anything.                                                           |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=636.74)  | The first letter A in lab is just a number between green and red, a number.                          |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=641.68)  | And the second B, the letter B, the channel B is a number between blue and yellow.                   |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=646.98)  | So the trade off here with lab is while we gained consistent lightness, we lost the sort             |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=651.5)   | of articulation power that we had in the other ones with hue and saturation.                         |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=655.9)   | Like that was some pretty sweet syntactical DX that we had with those other colors.                  |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=660.98)  | But there are some little superpowers found inside a lab that I think are worth noting.              |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=665.06)  | Also some constraints.                                                                               |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=666.06)  | So just some cool little info about lab that will be worth your time.                                |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=669.34)  | First one is lightness, while it's a percentage data type, so in CSS it's a data type of percentage, |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=674.62)  | it has some interesting extra behaviors.                                                             |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=677.06)  | So it can go up to 400%.                                                                             |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=679.62)  | So you can say the lightness of this red is 400% light red.                                          |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=684.34)  | And while a lot of gametes won't know what that means and they'll clamp it to maybe 100%,            |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=689.62)  | a system that does have a red to represent that can be reached to its maximum.                       |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=694.62)  | Very interesting feature of lab.                                                                     |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=696.42)  | It also turns out that LCH has this too in its lightness.                                            |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=699.14)  | So another kind of fun thing about lab is the generic numbers that are accepted as the               |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=702.42)  | A and the B allow decimal places.                                                                    |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=705.02)  | They allow positive and negative numbers, but in practice they should never exceed 160.              |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=711.3)   | And lastly, the other color level for modern syntax of this allows you to do a slash and             |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=715.54)  | indicate transparency.                                                                               |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=716.82)  | So a couple of examples of lab, we have LAB parenthesis 0% 00 slash 0% would be zero black.          |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=724.66)  | It's like a black that's also has zero transparency.                                                 |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=727.38)  | But here's a more realistic example, which is LAB open parentheses 50%.                              |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=731.46)  | So we have 50% lightness, 24 space 78.                                                               |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=735.84)  | And that color I believe was a hot pink that I chose.                                                |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=738.46)  | So it's like a 50% lightness hot pink in lab.                                                        |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=741.64)  | So anyway, that's lab.                                                                               |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=742.64)  | It's kind of cool.                                                                                   |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=743.64)  | So it's perceptually uniform.                                                                        |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=744.78)  | It's oriented towards human lightness perception and has a couple of these abilities to go           |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=749.6)   | super into the CIE color space and kind of expose greater potentials out of the displays             |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=756.34)  | that you're sending it to.                                                                           |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=757.5)   | Anyway, it's super neat, nerdy color stuff.                                                          |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=760.3)   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=761.3)   | I think LAB is awesome and all, but authoring it doesn't really feel super straightforward,          |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=766.62)  | especially with the red green, with the blue yellow color channels.                                  |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=770.26)  | So this is why I think that LCH is super cool.                                                       |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=773.02)  | And LCH stands for lightness, chroma and hue.                                                        |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=776.3)   | Sometimes people refer to it as HCL, but essentially LCH is a hybrid between HSL and lab sort of,    |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=783.62)  | where you still get these consistent perceptual lightness values, which is the whole point           |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=788.02)  | of what we're trying to fix with lab.                                                                |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=790.22)  | But you also get to specify the hue and chroma, which is a little bit easier to grok than            |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=796.22)  | the color channels of red green and blue yellow and a little bit easier to edit without a            |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=800.94)  | GUI to set the color for you.                                                                        |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=804.22)  | Chroma here is a new vocab word that we haven't mentioned yet, but it essentially means color        |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=808.7)   | intensity.                                                                                           |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=809.7)   | So you can sort of think of it like vibrance or the color that is vibrating off of a real            |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=815.38)  | world object.                                                                                        |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=816.82)  | And so the syntax for this is LCH and then in the parentheses you have a percentage,                 |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=823.18)  | a number for the chroma and then a hue.                                                              |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=825.42)  | So lightness is in percentage.                                                                       |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=826.86)  | And then as with all the other color level four, you could add the alpha value with the              |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=830.88)  | slash and the alpha value, which can be a number or a percentage.                                    |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=834.44)  | So the syntax then just showcases that LCH with lightness, percentage, number, value                 |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=839.5)   | for chroma and then hue as a number value as well.                                                   |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=843.7)   | LCH is lightness is interpreted the exact same way as lab.                                           |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=847.02)  | So again, you can overshoot for turbo vibrant colors if you want to set it to 400%.                  |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=853.74)  | You probably won't see that any modern screens, but I do think that's a cool, neat thing that        |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=857.22)  | I just learned from Adam.                                                                            |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=858.94)  | And the chroma accepts negative numbers, but it will clamp them to zero and you don't want           |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=863.62)  | to extend 230 in this case.                                                                          |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=867.18)  | Last one LCH hue is similar to the hue types that we discussed before.                               |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=871.74)  | When you think about hue on this color wheel, meaning that it's an angle, you can map it             |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=876.18)  | to degrees.                                                                                          |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=877.66)  | It doesn't map the same way as all the other ones though.                                            |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=881.3)   | So remember this is perceptual lightness, not that calculated lightness and don't expect             |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=886.46)  | a one-to-one match to HSL.                                                                           |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=888.96)  | If you are specifying an HSL value and you're trying to make a chromatic HSL comparison,             |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=894.18)  | it's not going to be identical.                                                                      |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=895.9)   | So some examples of what this looks like, you could write LCH and then in parentheses                |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=899.86)  | 0% 00 slash and the percent that you want for the alpha numeric transparency.                        |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=906.08)  | So if you had a lightness of 50%, a chroma of 60 and a hue of 313, it would just be LCH              |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=912.5)   | and then in parentheses 50%, 60, 313.                                                                |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=916.16)  | And then you'd have the hue of 313 in the color wheel with a vibrance of 60, that chroma             |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=920.02)  | of 60 and a lightness of 50%.                                                                        |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=922.26)  | Right.                                                                                               |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=923.26)  | So I am sold on LCH.                                                                                 |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=924.7)   | It means I get the sort of syntactic articulation power that I got from HSL, but I get the lightness |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=930.58)  | consistency from the CIE space, which also I think I get more colors so that there's                 |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=936.0)   | even another benefit, which is I can reach further into color spaces and potentially                 |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=940.06)  | get these more vibrant.                                                                              |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=941.06)  | Anyway, so LCH, I'm sold.                                                                            |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=943.06)  | Why would I use anything else now?                                                                   |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=944.3)   | I don't know.                                                                                        |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=945.3)   | I know me too.                                                                                       |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=946.3)   | I love it.                                                                                           |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=947.3)   | Yeah, that's awesome.                                                                                |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=948.3)   | But I just support could be better.                                                                  |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=949.3)   | We'll see.                                                                                           |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=950.3)   | We're working on it.                                                                                 |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=951.3)   | So the second function, if you are wanting to use LCH or lab in your UIs is the color                |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=955.78)  | function, which is color as a function in CSS and it takes some arguments.                           |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=960.74)  | So the color function takes one or more comma separated arguments with each argument specifying      |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=965.9)   | a color in a color space and later colors acting as a fallback if earlier colors can't               |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=971.58)  | be displayed.                                                                                        |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=972.62)  | So for example, if the color space it specifies hasn't been loaded yet, if one browser supports      |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=977.88)  | it and another one doesn't, or if it goes out of a gamut range.                                      |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=981.28)  | So if you wanted to use lab and it turns out the calculated color is out of that gamut               |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=985.42)  | range, if you're using 400% of that lightness value, then you can set fallbacks.                     |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=991.66)  | So you can set the color space that is accepted that works in the gamut that the screen lives        |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=996.34)  | within and can provide.                                                                              |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=998.78)  | And then you don't have to worry about what crazy color would end up being calculated                |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1003.06) | without your knowledge.                                                                              |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1004.06) | You have more control over this.                                                                     |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1005.56) | It also lets you explicitly set the color space.                                                     |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1008.56) | This function is pretty complex, all bundled up into one color keyword.                              |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1013.86) | So what that looks like is you have color, the keyword that in parentheses you can put               |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1018.0)  | in identifier here, which for example could be RGB if you want to set the color space                |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1022.26) | there.                                                                                               |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1023.26) | And then you'd either have numbers or strings with your alpha value as you specify CSS for           |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1027.34) | colors.                                                                                              |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1028.34) | And then you have a comma and then the next color.                                                   |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1029.86) | So here, for example, you could have color RGB 50, 50, 50.                                           |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1033.92) | You're specifying the RGB color space and then you could have a fallback value to whatever           |
| [17:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1038.84) | color value there, or you could specify it with LCH to start with and then have it fallback          |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1042.9)  | to the RGB.                                                                                          |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1043.9)  | Anyway, color function is super cool.                                                                |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1046.06) | And if you do want to start playing with the stuff, highly recommend using the color function        |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1049.1)  | along with it.                                                                                       |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1050.1)  | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1051.1)  | I'm excited about that color function because it sounds to me like almost like image set             |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1053.7)  | where I get to say, here's four colors, starting with the most optimal one and ending with           |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1058.08) | the one that I'm least excited about.                                                                |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1060.06) | But go ahead and fall back this way.                                                                 |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1062.1)  | And you just kind of get the benefits of all the worlds.                                             |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1064.1)  | You get the color space and you get to all the syntaxes that you want.                               |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1067.5)  | It's sort of all wrapped up in one function.                                                         |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1070.42) | That's cool stuff.                                                                                   |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1071.42) | Who came up with that?                                                                               |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1072.42) | They're awesome.                                                                                     |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1073.42) | All right.                                                                                           |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1074.42) | So that was all of the upcoming device independent colors that you'll have available in the next     |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1077.62) | year or two.                                                                                         |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1078.62) | There's some browsers have even begun hacking on them.                                               |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1081.5)  | Hi Safari.                                                                                           |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1082.5)  | We love you.                                                                                         |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1083.5)  | And in addition to those rad upcoming syntaxes, we also have CSS color level five right behind       |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1089.58) | color level four and Yuna and I are co-editors on this and we're working to create color             |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1095.26) | modification functions.                                                                              |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1096.82) | So it's simpler to color adjust all of those syntaxes that we've gone over through a centralized     |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1101.78) | and CSS owned syntax.                                                                                |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1103.82) | So it's not stable.                                                                                  |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1105.3)  | And there's even in this spec two competing specs.                                                   |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1107.9)  | So we have two ideas at how we want to do this and we're trying to play them out to                  |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1110.76) | see which one's better than the other.                                                               |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1112.98) | And this is pretty far reaching color stuff, but we wanted to mention that color level               |
| [18:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1116.7)  | five is being worked on and it has even more goodies for you.                                        |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1120.02) | Who would have thought more color goodies just for you.                                              |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1122.86) | You're so lucky.                                                                                     |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1124.02) | Love color goodies.                                                                                  |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1125.26) | So that completes all the color level four and new syntaxes that you can use.                        |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1128.74) | I love going through all the syntaxes and options, but devices aren't the only color                 |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1132.94) | consideration which will affect how your users see the color on their screens.                       |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1137.34) | Biological differences can play a big role in this too.                                              |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1139.62) | Do you know that 8% of biological males have some sort of color blindness?                           |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1144.9)  | The most common one of those is red green color blindness.                                           |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1148.3)  | And that's not just one type.                                                                        |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1149.58) | There's a few different types of red green color blindness, but they're the most common.             |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1153.2)  | And that's a really big group of users that affects every single web experience.                     |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1158.22) | Because of that, we'd recommend not relying on red and green colors to indicate staying              |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1162.22) | your UI, such as feedback from login forms and to accompany any UI element that uses                 |

| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1172.74) | If you're using color in a data visualization, for example, adjust the bars or lines to have         |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1176.74) | slightly different patterns to help with the visual comprehension of your data.                      |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1181.1)  | Great tip.                                                                                           |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1182.1)  | And low clarity in vision also is a problem for many users.                                          |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1185.7)  | The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, sometimes said WCAG, were created to make                  |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1189.78) | sure that all users have equal access to content online.                                             |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1193.14) | And we just want to ensure that all the content can be accessed by everyone.                         |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1196.74) | And there's three different levels of accessibility compliance, single A, double A, and triple       |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1200.94) | A. And as a website author, you should be able                                                       |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1202.72) | to see that the visual contrast ratio is a little bit different.                                     |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1205.26) | And you should always strive for double A compliance.                                                |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1207.82) | This means that for small text, a contrast ratio, which is an algorithm used to determine            |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1212.18) | visual contrast between the foreground and background, should be at least four colon                 |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1216.58) | five colon one, like four to five to one for all text on the page, and at least one to               |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1221.34) | three for large text, which is above 150% of your baseline of your font size of your                 |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1226.22) | web page.                                                                                            |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1227.22) | So it's important to think about your users and their perception and their devices when              |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1231.06) | you're out that allows you to simulate some of these color deficiencies and empathize                |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1235.46) | with your users, test your colors in your design, and make any contrast adjustments                  |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1240.74) | as you need to.                                                                                      |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1241.86) | Go DevTools.                                                                                         |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1242.86) | And DevTools also help you to see what the closest color would be that would be in an                |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1247.22) | accessible range.                                                                                    |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1248.76) | So it helps you sort of determine an adjustment to make if you need to adjust your brand colors      |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2wdKgTolHCMXS1YD24WMHH?&t=1252.7)  | or your site colors.                                                                                 |
