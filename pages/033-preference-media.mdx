| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.                |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=17.08)  | Today we're talking about user preference media queries.                                               |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=20.76)  | These range from user preferences around motion, contrast, light or dark theming, transparency,        |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=26.8)   | data and more.                                                                                         |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=28.28)  | I love that web development is getting much more customizable and I like to think of these             |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=32.24)  | preference media queries as the next axis of responsive design.                                        |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=36.86)  | Now we're able to respond to user settings and I think that's pretty cool and a pretty                 |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=40.58)  | big deal.                                                                                              |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=41.58)  | That's a huge deal and I find I get a lot of joy from bringing these to a page.                        |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=47.32)  | I mean I get a lot of joy as a user when I visit somewhere and I'm like, hey, dark theme.              |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=51.12)  | That makes like all the specs now that all the CSS specs can be in dark theme.                         |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=54.16)  | That makes me really happy.                                                                            |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=55.4)   | But I also like delivering reduced motion experiences for folks where I'm like, I know                 |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=59.34)  | someone is pleasantly surprised that there's no more motion in here and I'm hoping that                |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=64.78)  | they recognize even if they don't, I know that it's just they don't have to worry and                  |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=68.28)  | that's what I like is their preference that their operating system has made its way into               |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=72.64)  | my page and I'm listening for that hook and that's really cool.                                        |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=77.0)   | So most of the preferences referenced by these media queries are coming from the operating             |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=80.96)  | system like Eunice said.                                                                               |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=82.28)  | For example, macOS offers a preference in its system settings to reduce motion.                        |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=86.56)  | The browser is acting as a proxy for these preferences by allowing CSS to pivot based                  |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=90.92)  | on the value.                                                                                          |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=92.18)  | This proxy or broker situation that the browser is in represents most of the underlying workings       |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=96.6)   | for these preference media queries.                                                                    |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=98.28)  | But there are a couple of exceptions.                                                                  |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=99.8)   | We'll get into those.                                                                                  |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=100.92) | And furthermore, like on Android, there's settings for reduced data and color scheme                   |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=104.88) | and what's neat here is that affordances that have been created and loved by users, yeah,              |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=108.88) | they're making their way into our CSS.                                                                 |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=110.6)  | It's just so nice.                                                                                     |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=111.94) | And the way that they affect the cascade is really interesting.                                        |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=114.04) | The user can change these preferences at any time in their operating system and so can                 |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=118.5)  | your page respond.                                                                                     |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=120.1)  | So these queries change in real time.                                                                  |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=122.28) | They match their Booleans in real time and it can make for some really fun interactions                |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=125.9)  | too as you can just go toggle these things off and see your page transform.                            |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=130.04) | The current support of these is pretty good and we'll make sure to cover that for each                 |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=133.52) | of these queries but I do want to talk about the potential privacy issues that come up                 |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=136.66) | all the time with these preference media queries.                                                      |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=139.12) | And the reason is information about our user can be used as an active fingerprinting vector.           |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=144.26) | And what that really means is like your preference for reduced motion or your preference for           |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=147.86) | dark theme, these are items that they just know about you.                                             |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=150.84) | They're going to stash enough of these to create this like data profile for you and                    |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=154.74) | with that profile, they'll follow you around the internet.                                             |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=156.96) | So that's what they mean by fingerprint vector.                                                        |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=158.76) | It's like a profile that's been built about you with all the just public-y type of stuff               |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=164.08) | that you're doing on the web.                                                                          |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=165.64) | So it's a really healthy concern that we're being weary to release more user information               |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=170.44) | to the public.                                                                                         |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=171.44) | Like if I prefer reduced data, prefer reduced motion, it is something we should be considerate         |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=175.14) | of to make sure that we're not just willy-nilly releasing a hundred different attributes about         |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=180.14) | a user to the world so that the fingerprinting gets even better.                                       |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=183.24) | They'll know that you're a hacker because you like dark theme.                                         |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=186.44) | Yeah, they're going to send me hacker clothing ads because I prefer dark theme.                        |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=193.4)  | Actually it's probably already happening.                                                              |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=195.4)  | Yeah, I'm sure that's already happening.                                                               |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=197.88) | So those are definitely concerns that are valid and it is weird that styling has privacy               |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=205.44) | implications but everything, yeah, on the web.                                                         |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=209.72) | So one strategy that I like to use in general when writing websites and theming things is              |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=214.72) | using global CSS custom properties for page theming and having your entire app use values              |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=220.04) | of custom properties allows for you to easily and dynamically adjust those values.                     |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=225.0)  | And for the sake of this podcast, that means that you can easily adjust those values based             |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=229.56) | on the preference media queries that your users set.                                                   |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=233.46) | So one example would be having variables like background color and text color, button color,           |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=238.56) | on button color, those sorts of variables.                                                             |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=241.02) | You could then swap the original theme values to a dark or light theme based on user preferences       |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=246.86) | with prefers color scheme.                                                                             |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=248.6)  | You could change semi-transparent colors for prefers reduced transparency or adjust an                 |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=253.44) | animation speed for prefers reduced motion if you have all these in custom properties.                 |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=258.46) | And since these preferences are written as media queries, you would just need to update                |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=263.08) | the variable value once at the global scope and the effects would then trickle down throughout         |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=267.28) | your entire application.                                                                               |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=269.0)  | So I'm so glad you brought that up.                                                                    |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=271.04) | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=272.04) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=273.04) | So this is just an approach that I like to take and I've seen other sites do this and                  |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=277.64) | I think that it's sort of the future of theming and writing styles, especially global styles.          |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=285.12) | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                      |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=286.24) | I do this with my dark and light themes.                                                               |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=288.0)  | You know, I set custom properties on root and then I have a media query that's looking                 |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=291.16) | to see and it will just update those custom properties.                                                |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=293.62) | It's really awesome and prefers reduced motion.                                                        |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=295.76) | You can set a variable for transition duration and then if they prefer reduced motion, just            |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=300.64) | say duration is zero or 0.1 second and now motion is gone and all you had to change was                |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=306.08) | one like sub value in a transition.                                                                    |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=309.0)  | It's just really amazing stuff.                                                                        |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=310.08) | So that leads into our first one that we're talking about today is prefers reduced motion.             |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=314.12) | It accepts two values, which is no preference or reduce.                                               |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=317.16) | It's kind of confusing to be honest, right?                                                            |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=319.04) | Prefers reduced motion reduce.                                                                         |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=320.96) | Shouldn't it be true?                                                                                  |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=321.96) | Like I do prefer anyway, whatever.                                                                     |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=323.4)  | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=324.4)  | So and no preference means you have not changed anything in your settings.                             |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=326.86) | So it kind of means someone is okay with motion.                                                       |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=330.8)  | There's no IE support, but otherwise really great support for this in browsers.                        |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=334.36) | So I suggest using prefers reduced motion right away.                                                  |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=337.08) | It's very fun and it detects the user preference just if they want less motion.                        |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=341.24) | Now the key word here is less motion, not no motion.                                                   |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=344.52) | Scrolling is a primary interaction on the web after all, right?                                        |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=346.64) | That is motion and I've come to learn that it's more about the control of the motion                   |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=350.68) | than the motion itself.                                                                                |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=352.36) | Motion the user isn't invoking themselves can make them sick, right?                                   |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=355.44) | If they're standing there looking at the screen and things are moving, they're not in control          |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=359.32) | that it's similar to them as being on a boat that's moving.                                            |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=361.86) | But if they're the ones moving the page and moving the elements across, it's no big deal.              |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=366.6)  | And if you look in a lot of the operating systems that have this feature where you can                 |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=369.56) | turn off motion, if you look to see how they continue operating the system without motion,             |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=375.98) | it's almost always a crossfade.                                                                        |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=378.14) | So essentially if the user doesn't like motion, then you construct a crossfade as a transition.        |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=382.52) | So this means color and opacity.                                                                       |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=384.28) | These are fair game and you just crossfade your heart away.                                            |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=387.04) | There's a lot of really rad ways to stay inside of this user preference.                               |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=390.92) | Like I don't find this hindering.                                                                      |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=391.92) | I find this just makes me flex my creativity and that's why I like it so much.                         |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=395.96) | Yeah, I really liked that hot tip there with when you are applying styles for reduced motion,          |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=400.76) | you don't have to completely remove motion.                                                            |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=402.38) | In fact, motion is often good for showcasing transitions or changes in your UI and that's              |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=409.96) | important and necessary.                                                                               |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=411.62) | So next we have prefers reduce transparency and like prefers reduce motion, there's two                |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=415.4)  | values here.                                                                                           |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=416.4)  | One is no preference and one is reduce.                                                                |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=418.3)  | So it's kind of the same thing where like, does that make sense to do prefers reduce                   |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=421.92) | transparency reduce when it's kind of just like prefers reduce transparency true, but                  |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=426.28) | that is a preference to reduce.                                                                        |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=427.92) | So an important thing to note here is that there is no current browser support, but this               |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=431.46) | is a part of the media queries level five spec and it's usually brought up along with                  |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=435.92) | the rest of the preference media queries.                                                              |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=437.8)  | It's just like a part of this like bucket of feature sets and this detects user preference             |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=443.22) | for those who prefer reduce transparency and therefore more opaqueness.                                |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=447.26) | So that would improve legibility on the page.                                                          |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=450.52) | So why would we potentially need this?                                                                 |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=452.2)  | Well, right now builders will often use semi-transparent backgrounds to help text be more visible that |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=458.6)  | might be on top of something like a hero image, but it might still be a little bit difficult           |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=463.04) | to read because you do have a little bit of the transparency.                                          |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=466.16) | So when designing for reduced transparency, you might want to consider providing that                  |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=471.0)  | opaque experience or at least something with a little bit more opaqueness.                             |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=475.14) | So if you had a transparency of like 60%, maybe bring that up to like 90%.                             |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=480.12) | So you could still have some sort of see-through, but it will be reduced transparency.                 |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=485.54) | And honestly, I think the best use case here is probably just make it opaque, you know.                |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=490.68) | So this is also a good opportunity to test for color contrast accessibility.                           |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=495.36) | You should be doing that anyway when you do have semi-transparent areas.                               |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=501.32) | This is really tricky to test because you don't have a solid layer behind the transparent              |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=506.28) | one when you're doing this over top of an image usually.                                               |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=509.32) | And so it's best to test with a few different color pickings of areas in that photo if you're          |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=517.76) | doing that.                                                                                            |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=518.76) | Yeah, like a small sampling of things around the text to gauge its average contrast or                 |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=524.72) | something.                                                                                             |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=525.72) | Yeah, it is a tough one.                                                                               |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=526.72) | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=527.72) | And you mentioned preferring contrast in there, just making sure that you're passing contrast,         |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=531.08) | which is definitely something as a baseline that you should be passing.                                |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=534.64) | But we also have a prefers contrast media query that's coming down the pipeline as well.               |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=539.16) | And this would be discrete and it has four values.                                                     |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=542.32) | It takes no preference, less, more, and forced.                                                        |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=544.56) | And I want to first talk about less and more because I think this is a really common design            |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=549.02) | request is that I would, you know, a designer is like, well, I want to stay in a less contrasted       |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=554.04) | main design, but if someone wants more contrast, I should go add more contrast.                        |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=559.12) | And then, you know, in the extreme scenario, we get to forced.                                         |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=561.72) | And I think that's, that could be really, really meaningful because I think a lot of                   |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=564.6)  | designers feel like they have to make a lot of sacrifices to pass contrast ratios on the               |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=568.72) | web and having this user preference would let them have their cake and eat it too.                     |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=572.4)  | So I'm excited to see where this one goes.                                                             |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=574.36) | It's currently only behind a flag in Firefox.                                                          |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=576.08) | So it works like the others.                                                                           |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=577.48) | It detects the user preference for increase or decreased color contrast, but it also has               |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=581.84) | the ability for the user can force colors and contrast even so you don't have to, you                  |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=586.76) | know, be trifled with contrast at all.                                                                 |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=589.2)  | And the contrast choices aren't really present in any operating system, but you can choose             |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=593.44) | forced colors in Windows.                                                                              |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=595.5)  | And forced is super special here.                                                                      |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=596.84) | It kind of needs a whole different explanation than the rest.                                          |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=599.64) | Like all these preference media queries, they are essentially like saying, hi, the user                |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=603.52) | has this preference.                                                                                   |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=604.6)  | You can make style changes now, but forced is a little bit different.                                  |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=607.64) | It says, hi, we forced colors.                                                                         |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=609.7)  | Everything is different now.                                                                           |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=610.7)  | Would you like to make changes?                                                                        |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=612.88) | And so it's a little unique in that way.                                                               |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=616.16) | So hopefully that explanation helps you understand what's going on.                                    |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=618.76) | Forced is saying something already happened versus less or more contrast preferences would             |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=622.44) | be people asking the developer to make something happen.                                               |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=625.72) | So the spec is full of nested notes and exceptions for the spec entry.                                 |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=630.16) | And I estimate it'll change a little bit.                                                              |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=631.96) | The previously used forced colors media query feature seemed more in line with this, but               |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=637.08) | it does show up here in the preferences.                                                               |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=638.92) | And I just trust that the smart and considerate people working on this, that they're making            |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=643.2)  | the right decisions.                                                                                   |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=644.2)  | So we'll see.                                                                                          |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=645.2)  | What happens with prefers contrast less, more enforced over time?                                      |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=648.48) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=649.48) | So that's a really good note about the forced versus the prefers contrast, because I think             |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=656.88) | that low contrast things are kind of trendy right now, but they don't always work for                  |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=660.68) | everyone.                                                                                              |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=661.68) | So this is an important one to include for your best user experience.                                  |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=667.74) | Next we have prefers color scheme, which is really fun.                                                |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=671.62) | So the values here are light and dark.                                                                 |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=674.16) | There's no in between color scheme and operating system preferences.                                   |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=677.56) | It's usually light, dark, or auto, which would detect, I guess, if it's either dark or light           |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=683.88) | around the screen or use like time of day to make those shifting preferences.                          |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=690.0)  | This one is supported in all modern browsers, but it's not supported in IE.                            |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=693.76) | So it would be sort of like a progressive enhancement for your users.                                  |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=697.92) | And the reason I said this one was really fun because you as a web author get to create                |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=702.08) | multiple themes based on those user preferences.                                                       |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=705.24) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=706.24) | And I mentioned earlier, like using custom properties to set up themes for this.                       |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=711.6)  | I think that is the best way to do it because you can just have all of these values trickle            |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=717.14) | out into your entire application.                                                                      |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=718.8)  | And it's very rewarding to see, you know, you turn on that switch either in dev tools                  |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=723.68) | or in your operating system and see your entire app just like switch to dark or light mode.            |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=729.0)  | And yeah, I've been including this with all the apps I've been building lately because                 |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=733.44) | I think it's important.                                                                                |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=735.28) | Also on mobile devices, you'll see a lot more use of dark mode and dark themes.                        |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=739.6)  | And those take up less battery life than OLED screens.                                                 |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=742.92) | So they're becoming more and more popular.                                                             |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=745.42) | And we're starting to see many more dark theme enabled websites and web apps.                          |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=751.24) | So if you're designing mobile first, you should definitely be designing with the dark theme            |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=755.72) | in mind.                                                                                               |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=756.78) | So an app that I think is really interesting that uses both dark and light themes and takes            |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=761.92) | advantage of those is the Robinhood app.                                                               |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=764.8)  | So this one, if you go on Robinhood.com and their website, you can see their entire theme              |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=769.88) | in their body.                                                                                         |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=770.88) | They use custom properties to set it all up and they're not yet doing a dark theme there,              |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=777.08) | but they do like a dark first light based on if market hours are open and closed.                      |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=782.28) | And so I think that that is really clever and they're also changing the color from green               |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=787.2)  | to red based on if your portfolio is up or down for the day or the hour, whatever the                  |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=791.76) | time limit, which I think is really clever.                                                            |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=795.36) | I wonder if that works for colorblind users, but I think it's like a cool little user experience       |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=802.52) | booster for their app.                                                                                 |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=805.32) | So I think it's a cool example, especially if you're thinking about using custom properties            |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=810.12) | for theming, check out their website and you can see a good example of that.                           |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=813.92) | The last prefers media query we have here is prefers reduced data and the values are                   |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=820.24) | similar to the others, no preference or reduce.                                                        |

| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=828.08) | data when loading a page.                                                                              |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=829.2)  | This can be triggered by things like light mode in a browser, but it's not specific to                 |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=832.92) | an operating system like some of the others.                                                           |

| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=839.12) | So there's browsers that ship data saver mode on by default and what it does is it on their            |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=843.64) | server they'll compress files and do all this stuff so that by the time it gets to your                |

| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=859.96) | And if someone's browsing in a really constrained scenario and asking for reduced data, you            |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=864.0)  | can request smaller images.                                                                            |

| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=873.52) | So those are the preference media queries.                                                             |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=876.26) | I think that these are great that they're a part of the web now and many of them work                  |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C4WFzNYXzFt7JRhtlX9Qd?&t=880.6)  | in several browsers, especially prefers color scheme.                                                  |
