| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=0.0)    | Hello and welcome back to the CSS podcast where we break down CSS properties and concepts      |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=17.52)  | to bring you the best bits and pieces of what's happening on the web platform.                 |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=21.74)  | There's so much going on right now and it's definitely one of the most exciting times          |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=25.96)  | I can remember in my career for UI developers.                                                 |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=28.96)  | So we want to keep you in the loop about all of these changes and especially the ones you      |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=33.0)   | can use in browsers now.                                                                       |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=34.92)  | So today we're talking about one of the biggest landings happening in responsive design space  |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=40.08)  | and that is container queries.                                                                 |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=43.06)  | Container queries.                                                                             |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=44.06)  | Container queries.                                                                             |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=45.52)  | If you haven't heard about it's just fun to say too.                                           |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=49.24)  | If you haven't heard about container queries before, no worries.                               |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=52.08)  | We're going to go over what they are, how to use them and talk about what you can and          |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=55.12)  | can't do in web browsers today.                                                                |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=56.72)  | So Yuna, how would you describe to someone what a container query is?                          |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=60.64)  | Good question.                                                                                 |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=61.64)  | And it's kind of funny to describe something so visual in a podcast format, but let me         |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=66.06)  | paint you a picture.                                                                           |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=67.44)  | If you've built anything in the past 10 years, it's likely that you've had to think about      |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=71.88)  | how it would adapt to different screen sizes.                                                  |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=75.22)  | You want your website to look good on both mobile and desktop and whatever's next.             |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=79.24)  | And you don't want to create a separate m.site for the different versions for the mobile       |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=83.46)  | site.                                                                                          |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=84.46)  | So what do we use for that?                                                                    |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=86.46)  | Media queries.                                                                                 |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=87.46)  | Exactly.                                                                                       |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=88.46)  | You likely used a media query to set up some logic, which adjusts components styles at         |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=94.24)  | different screen sizes.                                                                        |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=95.8)   | And you might go from a single column layout to a two column layout when the component         |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=99.56)  | has more screen real estate to take up.                                                        |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=101.4)  | Oh yeah, we had an episode on page media queries, episode 32.                                  |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=104.84) | Yeah, good call.                                                                               |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=106.44) | The problem is using media queries, we only have access to the page's global viewport          |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=110.8)  | information, not the information of where the component appears.                               |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=114.52) | And in today's framework and component based UI design systems, we're usually building         |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=119.04) | reusable components that get placed on multiple pages and in multiple environments.            |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=123.8)  | With container queries, we can apply more granular logic to enable these components            |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=129.04) | to own their responsive styles.                                                                |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=131.52) | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=132.52) | Yes, you might want a card component to have a single column portrait type layout if it's      |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=136.62) | in a sidebar.                                                                                  |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=138.16) | But even though your user is looking at it from a really wide viewport, with container         |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=142.64) | queries, you can actually write this logic and attach it to your target element.               |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=145.84) | So you don't have to worry about where it lives in the UI and what the rest of the page        |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=150.12) | looks like.                                                                                    |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=151.12) | When combined with flexible properties like grid and flexbox, there's even more cool things    |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=155.96) | you can do.                                                                                    |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=156.96) | And you can write really robust, intrinsic design systems.                                     |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=159.94) | It's a new entry point for responsive design.                                                  |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=162.0)  | Nice, you have so many cool phrases to save our container queries.                             |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=165.92) | All right, so to use container queries, we first need to set containment on the parent         |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=171.0)  | element.                                                                                       |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=172.0)  | We also have an episode all about containment.                                                 |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=173.92) | Now it's episode 43.                                                                           |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=175.28) | This is like an episode just pointing you to other episodes.                                   |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=177.32) | I know, because we've made so many at this point that we've covered like most of CSS.          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=182.8)  | This is true.                                                                                  |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=183.8)  | And so now that's why this season we're talking about the new stuff.                           |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=187.86) | That's true too.                                                                               |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=188.86) | And there is and there's still so much.                                                        |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=189.86) | Yeah, we're gonna have a big season.                                                           |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=191.04) | So be excited everyone.                                                                        |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=192.04) | And for more really catchy phrases.                                                            |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=194.24) | Okay, so we have an episode on containment as episode 43.                                      |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=198.12) | And you can do this by using the new container type property and setting it.                   |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=201.78) | So what we meant by you can do this is you can create a container.                             |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=205.32) | And you can do this by setting it to size, style, or state.                                    |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=208.76) | And this is the container type property.                                                       |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=211.02) | So there are three broader types of containment and they correspond to types of queries.       |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=215.32) | Currently browsers have only implemented size queries.                                         |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=218.46) | But in the future, you may be able to query a parent's style and its state.                    |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=222.74) | So size queries can be broken down into inline size, like width, and block size, like height,  |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=227.64) | which would query the elements inline logical axis, right?                                     |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=230.68) | This I could cover its horizontal in a Latin language or block logical axis, which is vertical |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=234.84) | in Latin languages.                                                                            |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=236.16) | So to sum up, you can write container dash type colon inline dash size on a parent element     |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=241.88) | whose children you want to style with container queries.                                       |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=245.34) | And it'll look for the inline size horizontal space in this case.                              |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=248.84) | Yeah, so then you can set the type, but you can also name that parent container using          |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=254.22) | the container name property.                                                                   |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=255.4)  | My daddy gave me a name.                                                                       |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=259.44) | You could call it like sidebar or card container.                                              |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=263.0)  | Container name accepts a custom identifier string and it works in the same way that you        |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=266.88) | would name a grid area if you've ever done that.                                               |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=269.6)  | So once you've given your container a name, you can then reference that name when writing      |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=273.72) | a container query.                                                                             |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=275.18) | So that might look like at container, card container, and then in parentheses, min width       |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=280.5)  | 350px.                                                                                         |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=281.88) | And that might be the inline size that you're querying with the previous setup that you        |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=285.68) | put with the container type.                                                                   |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=287.52) | In your container, a name is optional, but it's the best practice to make things a little      |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=291.8)  | bit more clear.                                                                                |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=293.3)  | And also named containers can really come in handy if you have an element with multiple        |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=297.54) | parents that you're querying.                                                                  |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=299.2)  | So for example, I made a demo once where I had this responsive shopping cart that shifted      |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=303.6)  | from icon only to like incrementally adding like detail and then text based on how much        |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=308.46) | space it had.                                                                                  |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=310.26) | And it also lived inside of a product card container that I wanted to sometimes query          |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=316.76) | that product card container.                                                                   |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=317.76) | So I was applying different container styles based on different container names to that        |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=322.24) | product card based on how I wanted to style it.                                                |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=324.8)  | And it was pretty critical that I had these different name containers, otherwise I wouldn't    |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=328.04) | know what it wanted me to look at.                                                             |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=330.08) | Right.                                                                                         |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=331.08) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=332.08) | Like if you don't name it, it'll just kind of query to find the nearest container with         |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=335.98) | containment on it, right?                                                                      |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=337.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=338.6)  | So yeah, having a name makes it so that you don't have to guess which it's going to traverse.  |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=342.84) | You get to know and you get to point right to this container, like, hey, this container        |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=345.5)  | that I set containment on, I would like to query you.                                          |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=348.36) | If your width is above this, here's some special styles for your SVG.                          |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=351.56) | Yeah, very nice.                                                                               |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=353.0)  | All right.                                                                                     |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=354.0)  | So you can write container name and container type in one line using the container shorthand   |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=358.48) | property if you like shorthand, which I do.                                                    |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=361.2)  | So this is also a new property that lands with container queries.                              |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=364.02) | So container accepts, so this is the new shorthand is just container.                          |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=368.32) | Just container accepts a container name and a container type all in one with name coming       |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=372.8)  | first.                                                                                         |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=373.8)  | So you can give your container name to use this shorthand.                                     |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=376.1)  | But then after that, you can write, for example, container colon card dash container space     |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=381.36) | inline size to be a bit more concise with the name of the type.                                |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=385.28) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=386.28) | So that's essentially just giving it a name and saying I want to query it in the inline        |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=390.44) | size direction.                                                                                |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=391.66) | So all in one, nice and handy.                                                                 |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=394.42) | It is important to note that you have to have a name.                                          |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=396.48) | You can't just write container inline size, which you used to be able to in early versions     |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=400.1)  | of the spec, but no longer.                                                                    |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=401.74) | So update your demos if you had the old syntax.                                                |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=405.2)  | Can you use an emojis container name?                                                          |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=407.56) | Probably.                                                                                      |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=408.56) | Probably.                                                                                      |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=409.56) | That sounds like fun.                                                                          |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=410.56) | You can do that with grid names.                                                               |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=411.56) | So yeah.                                                                                       |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=412.56) | Cool.                                                                                          |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=413.56) | I don't see why not.                                                                           |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=414.56) | Query the emoji.                                                                               |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=415.56) | Emoji queries.                                                                                 |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=416.56) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=417.56) | So now that we've set up our parent container, we can actually query it.                       |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=420.76) | You can style any child element using at container and look for changes on its parent to apply |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=426.28) | the style specified in the at container rule.                                                  |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=429.0)  | And this is where the similarities between media queries and container queries come into       |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=432.58) | play.                                                                                          |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=433.8)  | You write a container rule and then in curly braces, you put all the styling logic for         |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=438.28) | the children inside of it.                                                                     |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=440.2)  | So for example, a non-named rule on an inline size container could look like at container      |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=446.36) | space in parentheses min dash width colon 500 pixels close parentheses, open the curly         |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=452.24) | brace, and then inside that you'd have your styles like dot title and then font size to        |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=458.56) | rem.                                                                                           |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=459.56) | You could change the font size with the width if you wanted to.                                |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=461.92) | For a name container, it would look like at container space card dash container if that        |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=466.16) | was the name and then space in parentheses min width colon 350 px close the parentheses,       |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=473.08) | open the curly brace, and then inside of that you would have your elements and your styles     |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=478.04) | like dot title font size to rem.                                                               |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=479.96) | So yeah, you could do this two ways, but you'd use at container to write the entire container  |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=484.58) | rule and you'd have a whole block of styles.                                                   |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=486.88) | Got it.                                                                                        |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=487.88) | Okay, so we've got like a three-part thing here.                                               |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=490.04) | First you have to establish a container.                                                       |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=491.92) | So something has to tell the browser, I will be queried and my width will be queried, for      |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=497.28) | example, like my inline size.                                                                  |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=498.86) | Here's my name, maybe.                                                                         |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=500.68) | And then some sort of container query gets authored that targets that container, queries       |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=506.76) | its width just like it would be the browser viewport, and then supplies a whole set of         |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=510.34) | selectors and styles to be applied to that.                                                    |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=512.44) | Okay, and then your first one was just at container with no name, which means it's just        |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=516.44) | going to look to the nearest parent element that has containment on it, query that versus      |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=521.92) | the second example where you explicitly said, I want to look at the card container container.  |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=526.64) | Well, that was just fun to say.                                                                |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=528.54) | And then you can provide styles for the case where that's either over or below that width      |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=532.76) | that you're at.                                                                                |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=533.76) | Okay, awesome.                                                                                 |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=534.76) | Well, where does that leave us with?                                                           |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=537.0)  | I guess some DevTools.                                                                         |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=539.14) | Let's talk about some DevTools.                                                                |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=541.0)  | If you're playing with container queries, there's also great DevTools in Chrome that           |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=544.24) | you can try out.                                                                               |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=545.24) | First, we'll show you a container badge in the DOM panel next to all the container parents,    |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=549.12) | just like it does with like CSS Grid parents.                                                  |
| [09:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=551.16) | And if you click on that badge, it highlights all the children that query this parent.         |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=555.56) | It's pretty sweet.                                                                             |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=556.84) | And then in the elements panel, you can see all of your container declarations when they're    |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=560.04) | active and fulfill the query's condition.                                                      |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=563.28) | When hovered over, the name turns into a link to the element in the elements panel and the     |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=567.0)  | styles pane displays the queried property and its current value, which could be the width      |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=571.48) | of the parent if querying inline size and like a Latin language.                               |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=574.6)  | And finally, just like media queries, you can make adjustments and changes to any of           |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=578.72) | the code in the styles pane, including the at container declaration.                           |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=582.64) | And to top it off, there's a polyfill.                                                         |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=584.36) | If you want to use size-based container queries today, there's a polyfill on Google Chrome     |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=589.16) | Labs.                                                                                          |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=590.16) | It works on Safari 13.4, Chrome 79, Edge 79, Samsung Internet 9.2, and Firefox 69+.            |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=598.72) | So now let's talk about the future.                                                            |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=603.2)  | So I briefly hinted at this earlier, but querying size isn't the only thing you can do with    |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=608.24) | container queries.                                                                             |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=609.56) | In the future, you'll also be able to query a parent's CSS styles.                             |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=614.56) | That means you can query to test against any style of a target elements DOM tree and apply     |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=621.04) | style containment on it.                                                                       |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=623.44) | Also, the working group did resolve to make style containers the default.                      |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=629.4)  | If you are wanting to look for an immediate parent, you're able to do that, unlike with        |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=634.6)  | size containers where you have to set a containment type to size or inline size or block size. |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=641.28) | So why would you want to do this?                                                              |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=643.88) | So say you want to make text stand out inline.                                                 |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=647.4)  | Like say you have an italicized quote in a paragraph.                                          |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=650.36) | You might use an itag to make it italic.                                                       |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=652.92) | And that would work.                                                                           |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=653.92) | It would be italic.                                                                            |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=654.92) | But then what if that itag was inside of a block quote that also got styled with font          |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=660.76) | style italic?                                                                                  |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=661.76) | No.                                                                                            |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=662.76) | You wouldn't be able to see the italic text of that itag.                                      |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=666.52) | So maybe you'd want to give it a pink background instead to make it stand out in some other    |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=670.32) | way.                                                                                           |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=671.32) | This kind of speaks to the problem that we have with global information when really in         |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=675.12) | this case, we need local information, local logical styles.                                    |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=679.2)  | So with style queries, you can query against apparent styles to write more defensive CSS.      |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=685.24) | And regardless of the type of element, if it's an itag or a span tag or a p tag or any         |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=690.26) | other tag, style queries let you look at the specific style of any parent element to make      |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=694.88) | styling decisions.                                                                             |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=696.3)  | You can also do this for CSS custom properties, which means that you can then abstract values  |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=701.02) | to higher order variables like theme dark or spotlight true.                                   |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=706.88) | You could query any parent element for a custom property state and apply a set of styles based |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=712.52) | on that.                                                                                       |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=713.52) | Wow.                                                                                           |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=714.52) | So it's pretty cool.                                                                           |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=715.52) | And to use this type of query, you would wrap the styles in a style function.                  |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=719.4)  | So it would look like at container space style open parentheses.                               |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=723.64) | And then if it was a variable, you could do like dash dash spotlight colon space true          |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=728.4)  | and then close your parentheses and then in the curly braces and you'd have the custom         |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=731.52) | styles inside of the curly braces.                                                             |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=733.12) | So if you had a card that was the spotlight card and you applied any logic to set that         |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=738.48) | to true or set that in the HTML or in the DOM or whatever you did, you could have a            |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=742.56) | whole set of styles based on that custom property value.                                       |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=746.8)  | I love that.                                                                                   |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=748.2)  | It's awesome.                                                                                  |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=749.2)  | Style queries are a part of the contain level three spec, but they are not landing in the      |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=753.72) | initial implementations of container queries in Chromium 105 and WebKit.                       |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=759.88) | But container queries will be stable for size queries in Chromium 105, which is going to       |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=767.92) | be August 30th, I think it was stable, or at the end of this month.                            |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=773.68) | But these are not supported yet with the container query polyfill either.                      |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=778.6)  | So you can only do size queries for now.                                                       |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=781.16) | Style queries are the future.                                                                  |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=782.8)  | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=783.8)  | I have a use case in my mind.                                                                  |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=784.88) | I'm thinking about a lot.                                                                      |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=785.88) | You've got a background of your website and then you usually have another layer on top         |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=791.12) | that represents some sort of surface.                                                          |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=793.08) | I always call them surface one and surface two.                                                |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=795.64) | And it works out really nice when you only have those things on that one surface.              |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=799.36) | But as soon as I need to put a surface on a surface, these style queries are going to          |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=802.92) | be really clutch for me to be like, okay, what's the color?                                    |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=805.88) | What's the style of this container I'm in?                                                     |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=808.44) | I need to be slightly darker than this or I need to be slightly lighter than this.             |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=812.4)  | And so the ability to know the background color of the context you're on is going to           |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=816.44) | allow you to make some really smart decisions about your design.                               |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=820.24) | I'm just really excited about it.                                                              |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=821.96) | It's super cool.                                                                               |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=822.96) | Also a note about stability.                                                                   |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=823.96) | By the time this podcast goes out, it will be stable.                                          |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=826.88) | We are coming at you from the past.                                                            |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=828.88) | Nice.                                                                                          |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=829.88) | And then we'll probably have a future episode where we're like, the future is now.             |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=833.84) | Style queries are here.                                                                        |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=834.84) | Okay.                                                                                          |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=835.84) | So then we also had state queries, right?                                                      |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=838.24) | Which you mentioned earlier as well.                                                           |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=839.4)  | So that's this second part, future part two is state queries.                                  |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=843.44) | And this is thinking even further in the future because where the style queries are coming     |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=847.44) | in the future, the state queries will be even further.                                         |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=850.32) | And these will be possible in CSS Contain Level 4.                                             |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=853.76) | And they're pretty early stages, but they'd enable you to check if a parent is in a specific   |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=857.72) | state, such as stuck.                                                                          |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=859.64) | Is it sticky and stuck?                                                                        |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=861.16) | Is it visible?                                                                                 |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=862.96) | Is it even in the view?                                                                        |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=864.04) | Is it in the DOM?                                                                              |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=865.54) | Can people see it?                                                                             |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=866.68) | Or is it snapped?                                                                              |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=867.84) | And so you could be able to query the state of an element and then change a style based        |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=871.84) | on those things.                                                                               |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=872.84) | Super cool.                                                                                    |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=873.84) | Should be so handy.                                                                            |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=874.84) | I feel like I keep wanting to write all my CSS in container queries.                           |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=878.96) | Yeah, might as well.                                                                           |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=881.28) | Yeah.                                                                                          |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iAiAYXHG4qztu5FDUSGOm?&t=882.28) | So that is a wrap for today.                                                                   |
