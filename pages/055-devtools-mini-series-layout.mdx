| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z index.          |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=17.8)    | You're joining us for our special DevTools mini series, where we're going over how you            |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=22.12)   | can get the most out of Chrome DevTools to help you debug and build your web projects.            |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=27.2)    | Today we're covering Layout DevTools, which are some of my absolute favorites.                    |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=30.8)    | And the new dynamic tools that were released over this past year really make an impact            |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=34.68)   | in debugging.                                                                                     |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=35.68)   | So I'm very excited to talk about all this today on the show.                                     |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=39.12)   | And for this mini series, Adam Nye, your regular hosts, are joined by our DevTools specialist,    |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=43.52)   | Jesseline Yee.                                                                                    |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=44.52)   | Hi, Jesseline.                                                                                    |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=45.52)   | Hi, everyone.                                                                                     |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=46.52)   | I'm Jesseline.                                                                                    |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=47.52)   | I'm the developer advocate for Chrome DevTools.                                                   |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=49.6)    | I'm thrilled to join you folks here to talk about Layout DevTools.                                |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=53.52)   | We're thrilled to have you on here.                                                               |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=55.12)   | Yeah, I mean, how could we have anyone else on the show other than the expert of Google           |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=60.32)   | Chrome's DevTools?                                                                                |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=62.48)   | Thank you for joining us.                                                                         |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=64.08)   | It seems fitting to start with the Layout DevTools episode with the Layout pane, a lesser         |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=70.18)   | known layout tool that I think it's kind of new.                                                  |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=73.98)   | And so let's start with where to find this pane.                                                  |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=77.0)    | You can find it under the Elements panel next to the Styles pane.                                 |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=81.18)   | If you don't see it, you may need to expand the panes with the double right arrow.                |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=85.44)   | This panel is especially useful for surfacing all of your grid and flexbox layouts into           |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=89.6)    | one area, aka you don't have to go search through the elements to find that grid or               |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=94.18)   | that flexbox badge.                                                                               |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=95.68)   | It has two sections inside of it, one for grid and one for flexbox.                               |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=100.14)  | Each can be expanded and collapsed to save space.                                                 |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=102.92)  | The grid section has a settings area with options for changing how the grid overlay               |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=106.56)  | works and looks.                                                                                  |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=107.9)   | So things like toggling the visibility of track sizes or area names or showing extended           |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=112.44)  | grid lines outside of the container.                                                              |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=114.76)  | Under the settings is a list of all the grids on the page where you can toggle their grid         |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=118.72)  | overlay and change the color of the overlay.                                                      |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=121.8)   | I change the color all the time for screenshots.                                                  |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=124.92)  | Just pick something that matches my color scheme better.                                          |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=128.16)  | That's a DevRel pro tip right there.                                                              |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=131.56)  | Change the grid lines to match your vibe.                                                         |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=134.12)  | Seriously.                                                                                        |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=135.12)  | It just all looks so harmonious and nice when you pick a good color because sometimes it          |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=139.16)  | picks a pretty vibrant clashing color.                                                            |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=143.12)  | Anyway, if that color is bugging you, you can go change it right here in this layout              |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=146.56)  | pane.                                                                                             |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=147.56)  | The flex section, which also you can change the overlay colors of, doesn't have an overlay        |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=152.4)   | setting, but it does show you all your flexbox containers with buttons for toggling their         |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=156.04)  | overlays and changing the colors.                                                                 |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=158.04)  | So again, you can visit this layout pane, find all of your grids and all of your flexboxes        |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=162.44)  | in one spot, turn on all of their overlays and get this really robust overlay on your             |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=167.08)  | webpage of all your grid lines and how all your grids are coming together.                        |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=170.54)  | It's super invaluable.                                                                            |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=172.16)  | That's actually great for if you're debugging layout and you're trying to find where all          |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=176.6)   | of your parent sections are and other sections, you could just go through here instead of         |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=181.0)   | trying to go through all the HTML and find what the right element name is within this             |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=186.76)  | list of texts.                                                                                    |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=187.76)  | It just has all of the elements with their class or however else you're targeting them            |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=194.12)  | laid out and you can go right to it on the page.                                                  |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=196.44)  | It anchors you right to it.                                                                       |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=197.72)  | It does.                                                                                          |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=198.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=199.72)  | That's the next tip is there's an arrow right next to each of these grids that are flexboxes      |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=203.24)  | that it's showing you and it'll take you right to the elements panel to the applicable container. |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=208.02)  | It's like a link to a node.                                                                       |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=209.32)  | It's really cool.                                                                                 |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=211.16)  | So that was the layout pane.                                                                      |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=212.4)   | Well, what about padding and margin overlays?                                                     |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=215.8)   | So in addition to grid and flex overlays, which will show you gap as part of that overlay,        |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=220.32)  | you can also overlay margin and padding.                                                          |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=222.34)  | And this can be critical in understanding the space in your layouts.                              |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=225.16)  | So there's three ways to see this margin and padding overlay.                                     |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=228.32)  | There's single item at a time when you're using the element picker and a common way               |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=232.52)  | is with the element picker.                                                                       |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=234.32)  | You can find the element picker in the top left of dev tools with the square and arrow            |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=238.16)  | cursor icon, or you can press command shift C or control shift C for windows users.               |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=243.52)  | Once activated, the icon will be blue and as you're hovering over elements in your webpage,       |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=247.88)  | you will be shown the margin and padding among other really useful information as an overlay.     |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=252.92)  | So you could think of this like showing the margin and padding for elements underneath            |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=256.04)  | the cursor one at a time, and you can mouse around your page and see the spacing one element      |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=260.84)  | at a time for what's underneath your cursor.                                                      |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=262.88)  | But what about visualizing spacing across multiple items?                                         |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=266.66)  | So multiple items, this can be done through the styles pane rule hover.                           |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=271.26)  | So the way to do this with dev tools, find the style rule that has some spacing in it             |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=274.92)  | like margin or padding and hovering over the values within it.                                    |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=279.0)   | So like if you selected a card element in the elements panel, then went to the styles             |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=282.6)   | pane and hovered over the padding declaration, you'll see the overlay, you'll see the padding     |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=287.14)  | overlay.                                                                                          |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=288.14)  | You can also hover over the start of the rule to see the same overlay that the element picker     |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=292.8)   | shows.                                                                                            |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=293.8)   | So essentially what you can do is you're finding a rule that might match multiple cards and       |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=297.62)  | by hovering over the padding declaration for that particular class, you'll highlight and          |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=303.14)  | show padding for all of the cards at one time.                                                    |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=306.32)  | So that's how we've gone from single item, what's underneath your cursor to showing multiple      |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=310.12)  | items.                                                                                            |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=311.12)  | We're now using the styles pane as our way to toggle this overlay.                                |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=314.44)  | And lastly, there's another way to show padding and margin.                                       |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=317.6)   | Padding and margin is the box model element at the bottom of the styles pane.                     |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=321.16)  | So if you hover over each of the boxes in this box model, you'll see a matching overlay           |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=325.36)  | on the element in your page.                                                                      |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=327.2)   | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=328.2)   | And it also leads me more to this box model diagram, which is again, it's nestled at the          |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=332.52)  | bottom of the styles pane.                                                                        |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=333.86)  | And for the selected element, it shows all the box size impacting values to position,             |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=338.16)  | margin, borders, padding, and content.                                                            |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=340.32)  | So you can see overlays for padding, borders, margin by hovering over these different boxes       |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=345.66)  | in this box model diagram.                                                                        |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=347.42)  | It's a fantastic place to visit if you're curious why an element is sized or positioned           |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=351.0)   | the way it is, because you'll see the computed values for the padding and the margin and          |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=355.4)   | the size of the element itself.                                                                   |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=357.34)  | So three different ways to see different spacing overlays in your webpage to help you debug       |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=362.42)  | your layouts.                                                                                     |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=363.42)  | That was a great overview, Adam.                                                                  |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=364.42)  | And I agree with you.                                                                             |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=365.42)  | I think the layout panel is super useful and very underutilized.                                  |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=370.08)  | So great highlight there.                                                                         |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=371.9)   | I want to talk about some grid tooling now and also Flexbox tooling.                              |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=377.96)  | Well, grid tooling is very cool.                                                                  |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=380.48)  | CSS Grid is a layout mechanism that allows you to create both horizontal and vertical             |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=384.54)  | layout in CSS.                                                                                    |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=386.04)  | You do this by creating grid rows and columns and filling those rows and columns with content.    |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=390.48)  | So you could span the content across your grid areas.                                             |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=394.24)  | These rows and columns can have a set size or be dynamic.                                         |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=397.56)  | And the content that you place within them can also be explicitly placed or automatically         |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=401.84)  | placed.                                                                                           |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=402.92)  | This makes grids an incredible layout tool because you can get some really responsive             |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=406.92)  | results without the need to explicitly create breakpoints.                                        |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=410.72)  | And you can debug a grid element by inspecting it.                                                |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=413.28)  | From here, you'll find a grid badge that you can click on inside of the HTML, or you can          |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=418.32)  | find the element in the styles panel and find grid there.                                         |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=423.98)  | But if you click on that grid badge in the HTML view, this visually separates that grid           |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=430.76)  | element from the rest of the page and extends its grid lines visually so you can align things     |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=435.46)  | to it.                                                                                            |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=436.6)   | You'll also see the size of each of the grid cells dynamically.                                   |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=439.68)  | So yes, even as you resize the page, the cell size values will change and update to show          |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=445.28)  | the new size.                                                                                     |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=446.92)  | If a grid column has a value of a 1FR unit or a fractional unit, DevTools will calculate          |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=452.24)  | the equivalent pixel value and show that pixel value next to 1FR, next to what you set the        |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=458.46)  | dynamic unit to.                                                                                  |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=459.56)  | It's pretty cool.                                                                                 |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=460.84)  | You can also see the numbered grid lines in this view.                                            |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=464.28)  | You can give your grid lines names as well if you don't want to see the numbers instead           |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=468.0)   | of referring to them as a numeric value and spanning content within those values, which           |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=473.04)  | is also completely valid in the default.                                                          |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=475.32)  | You can give grid lines explicit names like header start and header end to be a bit more          |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=480.12)  | clear and then place things on those named lines.                                                 |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=484.28)  | And then when inspecting a CSS grid in DevTools now, you'll see those named lines.                |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=489.68)  | The final and probably coolest new feature with Grid DevTools is the dynamic grid editor.         |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=495.24)  | You'll find this not in the batch view, but in the CSS next to display grid in that style         |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=500.68)  | pane.                                                                                             |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=501.68)  | So here next to display grid, you'll see a grid icon that you can click on and it will            |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=506.8)   | pop up with a design tool like view that lets you dynamically set property values for aligned     |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=513.84)  | content, justify content, align items, and justify items.                                         |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=519.0)   | The coolest thing is it's just the click of a button, a button which has a visual indicator       |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=524.26)  | even to show you what it's doing to adjust these values and see how they shift the UI.            |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=529.36)  | It saves a ton of time trying to remember the difference between what justify and align           |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=533.4)   | mean and content versus items because it's all right there in a very visual format that           |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=538.28)  | makes it a lot easier for you to build your UIs and get the layout that you're looking            |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=543.46)  | for.                                                                                              |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=544.46)  | It makes it a lot more similar to a design tool.                                                  |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=546.16)  | So I feel like these new grid tools are super cool and we also have some really great Flexbox     |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=552.02)  | tooling that lets you debug layouts in Flexbox as well.                                           |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=555.32)  | Yep.                                                                                              |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=556.32)  | Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension.           |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=562.4)   | It is good at taking a bunch of items which have different size and return the best layout        |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=567.32)  | for those items.                                                                                  |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=569.72)  | Similar to Grid DevTools, you can find a FlexBash next to any element with display flex or inline |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=575.52)  | flex.                                                                                             |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=576.64)  | Click the best to toggle the flex overlay on the selected element.                                |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=580.88)  | If you want to see a list of all Flexbox elements on your page, like what Adam mentioned just     |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=585.92)  | now, you can use the layout pane for that.                                                        |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=588.96)  | While Flexbox is a nice feature, but I must say the syntax is a bit hard to remember sometimes.   |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=596.4)   | For example, I don't always remember which properties should be used to style an element          |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=601.76)  | to be centered on the page.                                                                       |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=604.08)  | Is that align items or justify content?                                                           |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=607.84)  | With the new Flexbox editor, it helps a lot.                                                      |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=611.02)  | In the styles pane, click on the icon next to the display flex declaration to open the            |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=615.88)  | Flexbox editor.                                                                                   |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=617.76)  | The editor shows you a list of Flexbox properties like align items and justify content.           |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=624.68)  | And each property comes with different preview buttons which help you visualize how the UI        |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=629.28)  | might shift with the value applied.                                                               |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=632.18)  | Click on the button to modify the property value.                                                 |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=635.34)  | Very handy features.                                                                              |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=637.4)   | Very handy indeed.                                                                                |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=638.78)  | That's what people say when they discover these dynamic tools.                                    |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=641.36)  | I see a lot of chatter on Twitter about how useful they are and I'm very, very happy to           |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=646.28)  | see DevTools kind of shifting in a more visual direction as well.                                 |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=649.56)  | Yeah, they're emulated after the alignment tools that you'd find in Photoshop or Illustrator      |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=654.68)  | where you're sort of like, I want to align this to the artboard, you know, into the center        |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=659.12)  | or to the right and they look just like that.                                                     |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=661.02)  | But they have a very special superpower, which is if the flex direction changes or the            |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=666.44)  | grid direction changes or the writing mode or the document direction changes which shift          |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=673.0)   | the way and the alignment of flex and grid items, so does this alignment panel.                   |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=678.78)  | So if you are struggling to, you know, memorize what flex row reverse is when the writing         |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=684.58)  | direction is changed, don't worry.                                                                |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=686.66)  | This alignment panel has all of that built into it and will show you contextually appropriate     |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=692.28)  | icons.                                                                                            |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=693.94)  | It's amazing.                                                                                     |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=694.94)  | Yes, that is such a great detail to mention.                                                      |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=698.92)  | It's very cool.                                                                                   |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=699.92)  | It also kind of helped me connect the dots between the like design apps, Photoshop, Illustrator   |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=704.92)  | that I learned as a youth and flexbox and grid layout mechanisms because they do use              |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=711.82)  | the same keywords and it helps you kind of connect the dots between like designing code           |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=716.36)  | a little bit there.                                                                               |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=717.36)  | I'm like, oh, this makes sense now.                                                               |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=719.96)  | It's helpful for everyone.                                                                        |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=721.44)  | I agree.                                                                                          |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=722.44)  | Cool.                                                                                             |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=723.44)  | So nice breakdowns of grid and flexbox, y'all.                                                    |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=725.4)   | That was awesome.                                                                                 |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=726.4)   | I'm going to talk about container query tooling next.                                             |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=729.8)   | So let's say you're building layouts that have container queries in them so your components       |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=734.16)  | can react to a smaller space that's more contextual to where it is instead of the page.           |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=739.78)  | So rolling out with container query APIs, expect more to come in our dev tools to help            |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=745.22)  | you inspect and debug all of your layouts and use cases.                                          |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=749.68)  | So the best entry into the container query tooling is through the elements panel, just            |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=753.48)  | like grid and flexbox overlays and they offer their relevant badges.                              |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=757.76)  | So will elements with containment on them.                                                        |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=760.0)   | So click the badge on the element will turn the overlay on for containment or back off.           |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=765.12)  | So you can toggle it right there in elements and work in progress.                                |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=768.32)  | You can try it out in Canary.                                                                     |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=770.08)  | There's bigger plans and more coming, but that's what's available at the time of this             |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=773.56)  | recording.                                                                                        |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=774.56)  | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=775.56)  | So what you can do to visualize layout is look at your page layers and how they all               |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=779.96)  | interact.                                                                                         |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=780.96)  | And you can do this in the layers tab.                                                            |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=782.88)  | The way to get to this tab is through the kebab menu and dev tools and it's under more            |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=787.28)  | tools.                                                                                            |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=788.28)  | Once you have the layers panel open, you can see your entire page at a glance.                    |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=792.16)  | You can pan around and even rotate your page to see the Z index layers and how they stack.        |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=798.24)  | Other features in this section include showing paint and scroll rectangles.                       |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=803.32)  | So definitely check out layers tab if you are trying to see how your Z indices stack,             |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=809.16)  | how your layers look and even how many layers you have because you don't want to have too         |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=812.72)  | many layers.                                                                                      |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=813.72)  | Might get a little wild.                                                                          |

| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=824.4)   | This problem is called layout shifting.                                                           |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=826.84)  | It's usually happened when images and ads finish loading.                                         |

| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=858.28)  | Apart from that, Google introduced a metric called cumulative layout shift or CLS to help         |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=864.08)  | you address this problem by measuring how often layout shifts occurs for real user.               |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4L5wmY6jprq5Zz5gIAWnz2?&t=869.74)  | To provide a good user experience, your page should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or          |
