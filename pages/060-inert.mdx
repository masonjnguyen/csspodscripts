| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=0.0)    | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast, where we break down what's happening on the web                    |
| [00:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=16.02)  | platform for CSS and UI.                                                                                 |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=18.5)   | Today is an accessibility-related episode, so to set the tone, follow me through a quick                 |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=23.4)   | user experience scenario.                                                                                |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=26.0)   | Let's say you pushed a red button in an interface to delete something, and some sort of popup            |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=30.72)  | confirmation appears above the rest of the page, with the page itself blurred or darkened.               |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=36.16)  | As a sighted user, we can see the blurry background or semi-transparent overlay on the page, and         |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=41.84)  | this indicates that the background page is currently off limits for interaction until                    |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=46.48)  | we've completed the task in the popup, or dismissed it.                                                  |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=50.36)  | But as a keyboard or screen reader user, these visual affordances to keep us from interacting            |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=55.6)   | with the page in the background don't work because they don't have semantic meaning.                     |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=60.6)   | The keyboard can still be moving around in the background page, struggling to find the                   |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=64.84)  | popup.                                                                                                   |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=65.84)  | In comes inert to the rescue, which is the topic of today's episode.                                     |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=71.76)  | But okay, so yeah, so what you do now is you put the inert HTML attribute on your elements               |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=75.94)  | that you don't want to be keyboard or screen reader accessible while this popup is showing,              |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=81.4)   | and boom, now you've matched the visual experience with the keyboard experience.                         |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=86.36)  | Scott O'Hara calls this inclusively hidden.                                                              |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=89.08)  | I like that, inclusively hidden.                                                                         |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=91.36)  | The JavaScript alert function is a good example of this type of focus management.                        |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=95.56)  | It creates a popup that blocks all interaction around it until it's dismissed.                           |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=100.12) | It demands attention, and it has special powers through the browser, hidden from frontend                |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=105.36) | developers until we got inert.                                                                           |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=108.72) | So now we can do it too, and by now I mean in Chromium 102, Safari 15.5, and it's in                     |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=115.28) | Firefox nightly.                                                                                         |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=116.4)  | So it's almost in all stable browsers.                                                                   |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=118.2)  | Nice, and I like to think of inert as a way to create focus by making everything else                    |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=122.92) | unfocusable.                                                                                             |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=123.92) | Like, for example, hey, I'll get you to interact with this potato by making it so that you               |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=129.96) | can't interact with anything else, right?                                                                |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=132.2)  | I block the rest of the world so the potato remains.                                                     |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=135.9)  | Why a potato?                                                                                            |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=136.9)  | I'm going to do episode 37 on pointers.                                                                  |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=140.76) | This is traditionally simple to do visually, but again, it's really tough to provide for                 |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=148.4)  | non-sided users.                                                                                         |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=149.96) | So before browsers implemented the inert attribute, developers would create focus traps with JavaScript, |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=156.32) | and this would watch for focus to leave an area or component like a popup.                               |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=160.32) | And if it left, JavaScript then grabbed focus and they would put it back inside the popup.               |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=165.56) | But now that there's the inert attribute, developers don't have to trap the focus, we                    |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=169.48) | can guard the focus.                                                                                     |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=171.16) | There's no finding and grabbing focus to put it somewhere else.                                          |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=174.32) | There's only the interactive areas that we want to interact with remaining.                              |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=178.24) | Right, inert isn't interested in making you stay somewhere.                                              |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=182.8)  | It's interested in making other places unavailable.                                                      |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=186.32) | And this becomes really useful for scenarios like we've been talking about a dialogue,                   |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=190.12) | a popup, a modal, a slide out side nav, right?                                                           |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=194.44) | This is anything that's off screen.                                                                      |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=197.2)  | To you visually, it's off screen, but to a keyboard user, they can still reach it.                       |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=200.48) | So if it's off screen, make it inert.                                                                    |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=202.88) | A carousel, like I just used this in GUI challenges so that the carousel is only showing one item        |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=208.08) | at a time, so I can use inert on all the elements not in view to take them out of the keyboard           |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=213.36) | flow.                                                                                                    |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=214.36) | Right, we talked about a popup.                                                                          |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=215.96) | And then you can, just like I was saying in GUI challenges, you take it out of keyboard                  |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=220.28) | flow.                                                                                                    |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=221.28) | And it's really important to note that it's the element and all of its children.                         |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=225.48) | So like if you put inert on the body tag, everything inside of the body is inert.                        |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=230.0)  | Pretty much your page becomes unusable, unless you have a dialogue that's in the top layer.              |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=234.04) | Anyway, there's a couple of exceptions, but it's a superpower of inert versus tab index.                 |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=238.76) | So when we were doing focus trapping, tab index was your strategy and you'd have to                      |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=241.96) | put it on every interactive item all the way down your DOM tree.                                         |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=245.56) | But with inert, it does the element and all of its children.                                             |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=249.04) | So anytime a new element has appeared that's over top of existing content and deserves                   |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=253.8)  | immediate attention, inert can help.                                                                     |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=256.84) | But remember, it's also good for offscreen content, inclusively hidden.                                  |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=261.24) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=262.24) | Yeah, inclusively hidden.                                                                                |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=263.24) | I like that.                                                                                             |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=264.56) | When you put the inert attribute on an element, it does a few things that you would otherwise            |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=268.64) | have to hand manage.                                                                                     |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=270.92) | Pointer events are set to none.                                                                          |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=272.68) | User select is set to none.                                                                              |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=274.9)  | And content editable is ignored.                                                                         |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=277.2)  | So this goes for the elements and all this descendants too, as Adam just talked about.                   |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=281.92) | So while inert is an HTML attribute, it's intersecting with CSS by enforcing some interaction            |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=287.64) | style for you.                                                                                           |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=288.64) | Yeah, there we go.                                                                                       |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=289.64) | We validated the reason that we made this episode.                                                       |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=292.44) | It's CSS-y.                                                                                              |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=293.44) | It is CSS.                                                                                               |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=294.44) | Well, it's an HTML attribute, but there's so much overlap with HTML and CSS.                             |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=299.72) | Totally.                                                                                                 |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=300.72) | Another intersection with inert is that it's an attribute, so you can use it in a CSS selector           |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=305.56) | and style inerted elements.                                                                              |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=308.44) | Inerted, that's totally not a word.                                                                      |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=310.28) | Inerted.                                                                                                 |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=311.28) | Worded that inert.                                                                                       |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=312.28) | Elements with inert.                                                                                     |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=313.28) | But I hadn't thought about that before.                                                                  |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=314.28) | That's a really good use case.                                                                           |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=315.28) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=316.28) | So imagine you have the inert attribute in a selector and you set the opacity to 0.5.                    |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=323.12) | This can be nice because then sighted users will see that something is inert.                            |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=328.0)  | It's almost like we're in an opposite scenario as before, where it's so easy to manage focus             |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=332.64) | for keyboard and screen reader users that a sighted user might be confused as to why                     |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=336.68) | something isn't clicking or scrolling.                                                                   |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=339.6)  | So that's the final tip.                                                                                 |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=341.12) | Inert by itself doesn't cause any visual change.                                                         |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=343.96) | You'll need to be in charge of matching the experience for sighted and non-sighted users.                |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=348.52) | Tuck inert in your tool belt next to display none, visibility hidden, or your screen reader              |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=353.3)  | only class that has special elements for screen readers.                                                 |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=356.26) | There's also the complimentary aria-hidden equals true attribute, which is available                     |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=360.66) | visually but not to screen readers.                                                                      |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=362.96) | And lastly, tabindex.                                                                                    |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=364.96) | Ask yourself, one, is this hidden for everyone?                                                          |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=367.84) | Two, hidden visually but is available for screen readers?                                                |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=371.56) | Or three, hidden for assistive tech but not visually?                                                    |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=374.8)  | And then follow that up with how should the keyboard and mouse be able to interact?                      |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33v1CKWKsZbXCSWTcLzLiF?&t=379.76) | Nailed it.                                                                                               |
