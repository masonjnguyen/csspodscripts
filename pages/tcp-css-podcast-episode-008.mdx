| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=16.8)    | Today's episode is about sizing.                                                                   |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=19.48)   | We're sizing up sizing in CSS.                                                                     |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=22.44)   | That means we'll be covering all the different types of unit values and where those unit           |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=26.08)   | values make sense.                                                                                 |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=27.44)   | We're talking about dimensions, absolute units, relative units, even angle units, frequency        |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=32.68)   | resolution units, and how all of those fit into your UI.                                           |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=36.72)   | Stay tuned to find out.                                                                            |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=38.08)   | When it comes to sizing, CSS has a lot of different interpretations.                               |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=41.88)   | For example, sizing can refer to box sizing or intrinsic and extrinsic content sizing.             |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=47.32)   | There's relative and absolute sizes and intrinsic and extrinsic sizes.                             |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=51.34)   | And sometimes you want to size everything based on a shared anchor, like absolute sizing,          |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=55.8)    | but sometimes you want to size relatively based on the content, which is intrinsic sizing.         |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=60.32)   | We'll help you grok all these fundamentals, though.                                                |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=62.22)   | Have no fear.                                                                                      |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=63.22)   | If you didn't listen to our first episode about the box model, that becomes really relevant        |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=67.24)   | here, and we do touch on sizing units like REMs and EMS in previous episodes as well.              |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=72.04)   | This episode, like the others, will be full of fun CSS factoids as we dive deep into accepted      |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=77.28)   | values and sizing units.                                                                           |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=79.3)    | So let's do a quick high-level pass on the categories for today's episode.                         |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=83.72)   | In general, what are the accepted CSS types that can be used for sizing, Adam?                     |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=88.4)    | Yeah, okay.                                                                                        |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=89.4)    | So we have numbers, which should be pretty familiar.                                               |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=91.8)    | Percentages should be pretty familiar.                                                             |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=93.72)   | And dimensions.                                                                                    |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=94.72)   | Ooh, dimensions.                                                                                   |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=96.04)   | It sounds like we're going somewhere cool.                                                         |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=97.64)   | That's a cool word.                                                                                |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=98.64)   | It is a cool word.                                                                                 |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=99.64)   | But if we're going to Home Depot, what are the dimensions of the table?                            |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=102.44)  | Oh, I guess we're just talking about links and stuff.                                              |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=105.78)  | That does make more sense if we're talking about sizing.                                           |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=108.36)  | But inside a dimension, it's just what CSS calls them, which is cool.                              |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=110.88)  | I like the word.                                                                                   |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=111.88)  | So we have angles, time, resolution, which refers to resolution of your screen, and lengths.       |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=117.96)  | And the different types of lengths that we have in these dimensions is relative and absolute.      |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=122.34)  | And you can also mix these things.                                                                 |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=123.7)   | So you can do a percentage and a relative length, and Calc will help you with those.               |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=128.44)  | So we'll talk about how you can combine these units soon.                                          |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=130.64)  | Why don't you start us off with numbers, though?                                                   |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=132.96)  | Tell us more.                                                                                      |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=133.96)  | Yeah, numbers is a great place to start.                                                           |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=135.76)  | When writing CSS, you can just use straight numbers.                                               |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=138.56)  | These are unitless values where you just specify a number and it has no unit type like px or       |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=143.32)  | vw.                                                                                                |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=144.32)  | You'll see number values when writing line heights and opacities and a few other properties.       |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=148.8)   | So these numbers are usually positive and start from zero.                                         |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=151.86)  | The more complex and specific you make a number, like a number with a very specific long decimal   |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=156.28)  | value, the more room there is for subpixel rounding errors and weirdness on your screen.           |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=161.54)  | So try to keep them short with probably one to two decimal places max, depending on where          |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=165.92)  | they're being used.                                                                                |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=167.64)  | Numbers generally get cast into a default unit type, and that type depends on where                |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=172.2)   | you're putting the number.                                                                         |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=173.88)  | If you're using numbers in line height, for example, like line height colon 1.1, that              |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=179.2)   | translates to 110%.                                                                                |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=181.72)  | But that isn't 100% of the height of the elements.                                                 |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=185.44)  | Instead it's computed based on the pixel font size.                                                |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=188.4)   | Or if you're using numbers within HSL, you can pass a number and it becomes an angle               |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=192.54)  | in degrees.                                                                                        |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=193.72)  | So if you have HSL and then in parentheses you have a number like 100 for the hue value,           |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=198.7)   | that will translate to the degrees that it is on that color scale.                                 |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=202.54)  | So that's pretty cool that you get all these things cast into different types based on             |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=207.96)  | where you're using the numbers.                                                                    |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=209.6)   | Next is percentages.                                                                               |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=211.4)   | Percentages are units that are denoted by a percentage sign following a number.                    |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=216.18)  | So you can convert numbers to percentages by adding that percentage unit value.                    |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=220.46)  | They're always relative to another size, like a length for example.                                |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=224.08)  | Anywhere a percentage can be passed into CSS, it's specced and coded to a predefined quantity      |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=229.44)  | in the engine.                                                                                     |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=230.72)  | Which is really cool, but a ton of work, so shout out to the CSS Working Group for handling        |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=234.92)  | all of these percentage values and what they mean.                                                 |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=237.52)  | For real, nice work.                                                                               |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=238.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=239.96)  | So let's check quickly about a percentage doozy in CSS.                                            |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=243.12)  | What's the difference between height auto and height 100% Adam?                                    |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=246.32)  | Well height auto is where it's going to be intrinsically looking at the contents inside            |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=251.32)  | of it.                                                                                             |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=252.32)  | So its height is unknown and will be automatically discovered when laid out within its constrained |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=258.64)  | space.                                                                                             |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=259.64)  | So if you have this div that's in a small box, the height set to auto, it's going to               |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=264.04)  | lay out all the text and flow it down to the bottom and its height will be what it is.             |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=268.52)  | But if you say height 100%, the intent here is that that child div that's inside of that           |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=272.96)  | constrained space will expand to the height of its parent container.                               |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=276.84)  | How did I do?                                                                                      |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=277.84)  | Is that pretty good?                                                                               |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=278.84)  | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=279.84)  | Yeah, that is a confusing concept.                                                                 |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=280.84)  | So it's a good way to explain it when you think about the parent versus its own content            |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=283.56)  | height.                                                                                            |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=284.56)  | Can be tricky though.                                                                              |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=285.56)  | Sometimes you write height 100% and expect it to expand to a parent and you don't.                 |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=288.96)  | And this is where a height autos can stack on top of each other and they definitely get            |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=292.6)   | tricky.                                                                                            |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=293.6)   | Like if height 100% is referencing a height auto, which is referencing a height auto,              |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=297.32)  | what does it do?                                                                                   |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=298.32)  | Anyway, that's where you need to start making some code pens and figuring it out.                  |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=301.72)  | Yeah, for real.                                                                                    |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=302.72)  | All right, well the next one, so you covered numbers and percentages.                              |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=305.4)   | Let's talk about dimensions and welcome to the latest CSS dimension.                               |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=309.6)   | We're going into the deepest dimensions of CSS sizing.                                             |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=313.4)   | Tales from the parallel dimensions.                                                                |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=315.76)  | There was just too many fun puns.                                                                  |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=317.08)  | You got to do like more like show intros.                                                          |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=319.76)  | I feel like you got some interesting...                                                            |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=322.0)   | All these little puns.                                                                             |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=324.08)  | Great transitions there.                                                                           |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=325.48)  | Thanks.                                                                                            |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=326.48)  | Okay, well, psych, right?                                                                          |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=327.9)   | We're not talking about CSS dimensions.                                                            |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=329.86)  | There's no deep space dimensions in CSS, but there are dimensions that are just numbers            |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=334.56)  | with an attached unit.                                                                             |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=335.88)  | So literally that's all a dimension is.                                                            |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=338.2)   | If you say a number and it doesn't have a percentage sign, but it does have a PX or                |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=342.6)   | a VW, then it's a dimension.                                                                       |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=345.48)  | It's a CSS dimension.                                                                              |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=346.48)  | All you have to do is put a little unit at the end.                                                |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=348.24)  | It's kind of interesting, but we had fun contorting you for a few seconds, right?                  |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=351.62)  | Thinking about its dimensions somewhere else.                                                      |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=352.88)  | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=353.88)  | I liked it.                                                                                        |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=354.88)  | And there's one more little fun factoid, which is that little unit that you put at the end         |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=357.28)  | of a number is called a dimension token, which is just kind of a fancy way of saying unit          |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=361.56)  | type.                                                                                              |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=362.56)  | Okay, so dimension.                                                                                |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=363.56)  | A dimension is like one REM or two inches or 500 pixels.                                           |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=367.46)  | Those dimensions also aren't related in any way, but I just liked that they were three             |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=370.62)  | different types of links that you can reference.                                                   |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=372.58)  | We had REM, inch and pixels, and the dimension token of one REM is REM, right?                     |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=377.72)  | Okay, so that's dimension token and CSS uses dimensions to specify quantities, distances,          |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=383.2)   | and a few other things like durations, frequencies, and screen resolutions.                        |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=386.88)  | So fun fact, Calc will let you combine compatible dimensions like Calc one REM plus 500 pixels     |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=392.86)  | plus two inches.                                                                                   |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=393.86)  | CSS will figure that out.                                                                          |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=395.76)  | How cool is that, right?                                                                           |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=396.76)  | And it's because pixels are the canonical unit and act as a common denominator in this             |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=401.1)   | case.                                                                                              |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=402.1)   | So thanks CSS.                                                                                     |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=403.1)   | Thanks CSS working group again, because you've pre-thought out all of these different combinations |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=407.06)  | and made it so that we can do the math really easy in CSS.                                         |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=409.38)  | I just really love that.                                                                           |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=410.58)  | Yeah, and that's super useful because if you were trying to do like 100% of the width minus        |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=415.46)  | a certain unit value, you can do that in a calculation.                                            |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=418.54)  | You can, it's really cool.                                                                         |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=419.54)  | You can even minus negative values and it'll do it.                                                |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=422.24)  | Very cool, tricky stuff.                                                                           |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=423.24)  | Okay, so now that we like covered sizing essentials and dimensions, let's dive into the types      |

| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=437.14)  | What do you got, Yuna?                                                                             |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=438.98)  | Lengths are dimensions that refer to distance.                                                     |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=441.38)  | They're numbers with acceptable dimension tokens, which can also be thought of as their            |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=444.88)  | unit values.                                                                                       |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=446.2)   | There are two different types of lengths.                                                          |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=447.62)  | There's absolute lengths and relative lengths.                                                     |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=449.88)  | So let's start with absolute lengths.                                                              |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=452.7)   | Absolute lengths are not relative to anything else and are generally considered to always          |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=456.9)   | be the same size.                                                                                  |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=457.9)   | It's like a constant length.                                                                       |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=460.32)  | And some of these go back to CSS1, like margin left two centimeters was something that you         |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=465.18)  | could write.                                                                                       |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=466.18)  | You can use a centimeter unit back in CSS1.                                                        |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=468.78)  | And I think a lot of this stems from this being something that formed after a print                |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=473.28)  | medium became digital.                                                                             |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=475.02)  | So these are sort of thought of as how can we convey real world into a digital world?              |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=481.0)   | So you might be thinking, what are all the possible unit lengths in CSS?                           |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=485.3)   | Let's jump into that.                                                                              |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=486.3)   | Yeah, let's do it.                                                                                 |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=487.3)   | The first one, as I mentioned, was centimeters.                                                    |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=489.76)  | So the unit is cm, the name is centimeters, and that is equivalent to 96 pixels divided            |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=494.82)  | by 2.54 because you can also think of 96 pixels as the inch value and centimeters are one          |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=499.98)  | inch divided by 2.54 for all of our American friends that went to kindergarten or first            |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=503.9)   | grade.                                                                                             |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=504.9)   | I don't even remember when we learned about this.                                                  |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=505.9)   | Second grade.                                                                                      |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=506.9)   | Well done.                                                                                         |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=507.9)   | And now that you've covered the divided by 2.54, I'm not going to cover it anymore because         |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=511.24)  | next is millimeters.                                                                               |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=513.22)  | And one millimeter is one tenth of a centimeter, which is the math that you just explained         |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=517.98)  | so well.                                                                                           |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=518.98)  | There's also the Q unit, which when we did our survey of the Web Almanac CSS, we were              |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=524.46)  | very confused as to what this was and where it was coming from.                                    |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=527.54)  | But the Q unit stands for quarter millimeters and one Q is one fortieth of a centimeter.           |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=532.9)   | I'd never heard of this before.                                                                    |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=533.9)   | Yeah, me neither.                                                                                  |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=534.9)   | That was a really fun thing to read about the Almanac and who is using it and why.                 |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=537.82)  | So if you're curious, find the link in the show notes.                                             |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=540.86)  | The next one is inches, which I covered earlier.                                                   |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=543.12)  | So this is another absolute length, right?                                                         |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=544.94)  | Inches.                                                                                            |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=545.94)  | This is something you can rely on to always be the same.                                           |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=547.7)   | Then there's pikas, which is PC if you're using it as a unit value in CSS.                         |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=552.38)  | And one pica is one sixth of one inch and one inch is 96 pixels in the browser.                    |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=558.14)  | Oh, is this a tomato tomato?                                                                       |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=559.9)   | Because my teachers in school called them pikas.                                                   |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=561.86)  | It was like, oh, we did typography.                                                                |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=564.22)  | It was like, oh, 10 pikas wide.                                                                    |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=565.94)  | I always thought it was pica, but I could be wrong.                                                |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=567.58)  | I think pica is something else, too.                                                               |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=569.14)  | Pica sounds kind of cooler than a pica, although pica chew.                                        |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=572.42)  | So I just need a pica.                                                                             |

| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=576.26)  | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=577.26)  | Somewhere.                                                                                         |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=578.26)  | Well, if I did.                                                                                    |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=579.26)  | The next one after pica is points, so that again, these are kind of like print relic               |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=583.42)  | unit types.                                                                                        |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=584.72)  | And points is one point is at one seventy second of one inch.                                      |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=589.34)  | So and then pica was one sixth of an inch.                                                         |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=591.58)  | So these are like finite units used in print.                                                      |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=593.94)  | They're all based on an inch.                                                                      |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=594.94)  | Yeah, again, that's that print to web connection.                                                  |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=597.64)  | And then finally, we have pixels.                                                                  |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=599.86)  | Pixels are something that we are all probably very familiar with.                                  |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=602.42)  | One pixel is one ninety sixth of an inch.                                                          |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=605.7)   | And it's something that we see on our screen that make up fonts, our web pages, our visual         |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=611.62)  | view of the web world.                                                                             |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=613.62)  | Yeah, these units are absolute lengths and they're tethered directly either to like actual         |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=618.8)   | physical size, like when they're being printed on a piece of paper or your screen.                 |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=622.64)  | And it's kind of cool.                                                                             |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=623.64)  | CSS and these browser renderers will do all the math for you.                                      |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=626.46)  | I love it.                                                                                         |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=627.46)  | In a digital screen, a reference pixel is used as a baseline to determine the size of              |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=632.44)  | these pixels.                                                                                      |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=633.48)  | So a reference pixel is based on the DPI of your screen and the length of the average              |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=638.22)  | arm.                                                                                               |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=639.22)  | Fun fact, which is twenty eight inches.                                                            |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=640.54)  | Whoa.                                                                                              |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=641.54)  | Learned that while reading the spec.                                                               |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=643.62)  | The viewing distance and would affect the results.                                                 |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=646.64)  | And the DPI does affect how these pixels look.                                                     |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=649.58)  | So as screens have gotten more advanced, as we have more high resolution screens, some             |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=654.5)   | of this stuff needs some mathematical calculations behind the scenes to make sure that it's even   |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=659.4)   | from screen to screen and making sure that what 200 pixels looks like on a lower DPI               |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=664.88)  | screen looks the same as a higher DPI screen.                                                      |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=667.06)  | Right.                                                                                             |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=668.06)  | That was like the whole point of the dip unit, right?                                              |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=669.5)   | In Android.                                                                                        |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=670.5)   | Yeah, Android uses dips for this.                                                                  |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=671.9)   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=672.9)   | So you don't have to worry about how many pixels per pixel depending on DPI.                       |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=677.7)   | Just gets crazy.                                                                                   |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=678.7)   | So dips were made for this sort of digital DPI world.                                              |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=681.72)  | We don't have those in web.                                                                        |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=682.72)  | It's kind of curious.                                                                              |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=683.72)  | Yeah, the browser is trying to do the calculations for you, but, you know, it could get messy      |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=687.78)  | there.                                                                                             |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=688.78)  | Oh, okay.                                                                                          |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=689.78)  | So that was all the absolute lengths.                                                              |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=690.78)  | So those are links that you can rely on to always be the same because they have a common           |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=694.42)  | anchor.                                                                                            |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=695.42)  | But what about relative units?                                                                     |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=697.14)  | These are contextual links in which in order to calculate themselves, it must know the             |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=701.82)  | context in which it's to be compared and calculated against.                                       |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=705.22)  | All right.                                                                                         |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=706.22)  | I think that'll become more clear as we go on.                                                     |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=707.82)  | But these are probably more familiar in the form of like M and REM and VW or Adam's favorite,      |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=713.54)  | the CH unit, the character unit.                                                                   |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=715.74)  | You'll see it all over my code pens.                                                               |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=717.02)  | I just I don't know.                                                                               |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=718.1)   | I just like it anyway.                                                                             |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=719.54)  | There's two different high level types, though, of relative units, two different types of          |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=723.06)  | relative units.                                                                                    |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=724.18)  | You have font relative units, which M and REM, but then you have viewport relative units           |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=729.46)  | and like the VW.                                                                                   |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=730.8)   | So we'll start with the relative font links.                                                       |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=734.14)  | And you know, why don't you tell us about the M?                                                   |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=735.78)  | Well, the M is interesting because historically this all comes from typography and in typography,  |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=741.54)  | the M is the height of the capital letter M in any typeface set.                                   |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=746.68)  | So that's the computed font size of this element.                                                  |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=748.9)   | It's supposed to be like the capital letter height.                                                |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=751.66)  | And it was based on that metal letter.                                                             |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=754.34)  | In the digital world, it's the width of the letter M and at least it's supposed to approximately   |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=760.22)  | be the width of the letter M. But since typefaces today can vary their capital letters, there's    |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=765.82)  | not like a set ruling.                                                                             |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=767.82)  | It's not as exact as it was back when there were fewer typefaces.                                  |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=771.5)   | This isn't always true.                                                                            |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=773.36)  | So generally, this is just going to be a percentage based on the base font size.                   |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=778.78)  | So for example, if you had 1.5 M's, that's going to be 50% larger than the base font               |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=784.46)  | size of its parent.                                                                                |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=786.8)   | That is the computed value there.                                                                  |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=788.58)  | So it's kind of weird, but people generally use M's to make parent font size relative              |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=794.0)   | units and sizing.                                                                                  |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=795.5)   | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=796.5)   | And yeah, I like that history too.                                                                 |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=797.58)  | It was so funny researching this where you'd ask people, is it the lowercase M or the uppercase    |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=801.74)  | M, is it the width of the M or the height of the M?                                                |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=804.34)  | And it turns out sort of all of those are right, just depending on where it is.                    |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=807.38)  | It's weird that it got swapped.                                                                    |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=809.54)  | That's the weird part.                                                                             |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=810.54)  | Yeah, it is weird.                                                                                 |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=811.54)  | Well, that's a, what was it?                                                                       |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=812.7)   | The M dash, the character that's in the Unicode.                                                   |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=815.5)   | So the M dash is supposed to be the width of the M. Anyway, it's funny stuff.                      |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=818.98)  | Well, let's move on to X because this has another kind of similar history in that it's             |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=822.38)  | supposed to be the height of X, like the lowercase X in your font size.                            |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=826.92)  | Turns out that's just not true.                                                                    |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=829.22)  | So the X unit is the EX, you can say like 1EX or 2EX, so you can put a number and then             |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=834.5)   | this unit type.                                                                                    |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=835.98)  | And so the reality though, or the way that X works is it's a heuristic.                            |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=840.3)   | So it's not a finite number that you can sort of always depend on in terms of like you can         |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=845.34)  | know ahead of time of what it's going to be.                                                       |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=846.82)  | It's going to change depending on the font.                                                        |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=848.18)  | So the browser gets to make some decisions here.                                                   |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=850.18)  | And what it's going to do is it's going to determine whether to use the X height that's            |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=853.5)   | metadata found in the font file, a lowercase letter X if the X height is not present or            |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=858.96)  | if it's junky and doesn't seem realistic.                                                          |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=861.9)   | Or if all of that seems like really bad math and it's not turning out well, the browser            |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=866.26)  | will just kind of default to 0.5M.                                                                 |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=868.66)  | So an X will be half of the width of the letter M. And again, this is just like M's, it's          |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=874.42)  | based on the current computed font size of the element.                                            |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=877.22)  | So it's inheriting a value from its parent and then it's calculating against that.                 |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=880.66)  | So it's a relative font size that's trying to use the height of the letter X, but it               |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=885.3)   | might end up just being 0.5M.                                                                      |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=887.66)  | So kind of weird little history about the X unit.                                                  |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=890.46)  | This seems like a really unreliable unit to be honest, because you're not sure where it's          |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=894.26)  | pulling the values from.                                                                           |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=895.7)   | Yeah, it could be a little shaky.                                                                  |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=898.18)  | So the next unit is also shaky because there's zero support unlike X, which has great support.     |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=903.86)  | But this is specced out, so we thought it would be worth the mention.                              |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=906.74)  | And this is the CAP unit, which is the height of the capital letters and the current computed      |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=912.1)   | font size of the elements.                                                                         |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=914.14)  | So I don't know, that's in there.                                                                  |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=916.14)  | That's in there.                                                                                   |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=917.14)  | I'm not using it, but it's interesting.                                                            |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=918.14)  | It's a fun fact.                                                                                   |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=919.14)  | Capital letter height.                                                                             |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=920.26)  | It's just in that family of MX and CAP.                                                            |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=922.26)  | Apparently those were just really popular ways of determining lengths.                             |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=924.86)  | Yeah, since M is width now, we needed the CAP, I guess.                                            |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=927.66)  | Back.                                                                                              |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=928.66)  | We needed the CAP, yeah.                                                                           |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=929.66)  | Super funny.                                                                                       |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=930.66)  | I mean, it makes sense, but yeah.                                                                  |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=932.78)  | The next one is the character unit, so CH.                                                         |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=935.58)  | And this is kind of interesting because it's the average character advance of a narrow             |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=939.34)  | glyph in the element's font.                                                                       |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=941.58)  | Okay, so for example, it's the narrowest glyph in the font.                                        |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=945.3)   | So it might be like the letter I, but it's going to be the average of those smallest               |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=949.06)  | glyphs.                                                                                            |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=950.06)  | And a character advance is kind of interesting too.                                                |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=952.06)  | It's the direction that the character intends to be read.                                          |
| [15:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=954.7)   | So it's the width of the reading direction, which is a little bit logical property-ish             |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=959.1)   | in mindset, but I don't think they're exactly the same.                                            |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=961.86)  | And yeah, so the character unit is an average of the most narrow glyph in the font.                |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=966.42)  | Kind of interesting.                                                                               |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=967.42)  | Then there's also IC, which is the average character advance of a full width glyph.                |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=970.7)   | So instead of looking at the narrow characters like zero, you're looking at the widest range       |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=974.66)  | of characters.                                                                                     |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=975.66)  | Maybe a W is pretty wide.                                                                          |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=977.04)  | And it's using that as the character advance, but this also has no support.                        |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=982.24)  | So if you want to use character advance in your code, you'll probably want to use CH.              |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=987.98)  | Another unit that we see often is REM.                                                             |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=990.04)  | So that REM unit, like M, is based on the base font size.                                          |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=994.96)  | But here, the parent that it's basing off of is always going to be the root value, which           |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1000.14) | is going to by default be 16 pixels.                                                               |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1002.28) | You can change the root values font size, so this will then change the REM values.                 |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1007.5)  | They'll sort of trickle out to everywhere else in the page.                                        |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1010.18) | But just know that this is relative to the baseline.                                               |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1013.1)  | If you want everything to sort of be more consistent based on that root value, you want            |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1017.94) | to use REM.                                                                                        |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1018.94) | It won't change based on the font size of the parent.                                              |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1020.26) | So you're not going to have these weird bigger, smaller sizes if you do change parents within      |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1025.66) | the HTML that you're then applying M's to.                                                         |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1027.86) | Anyway, REM's is for more consistency.                                                             |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1029.54) | Yeah, it's sort of like, you know how an absolute unit gives you this anchor that everything       |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1034.24) | can be measured against?                                                                           |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1036.08) | This is like a relative absolute unit in that you have control over the anchor.                    |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1040.2)  | So the anchor is set on the HTML, and you can either modify that value or let users                |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1044.3)  | modify it.                                                                                         |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1045.3)  | But ultimately, it's sort of in the middle here.                                                   |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1047.86) | It's like a hybrid unit.                                                                           |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1048.86) | It's kind of cool.                                                                                 |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1049.86) | Yeah, it's like a stronger anchor.                                                                 |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1050.86) | Instead of anchoring it to items within the UI, you're anchoring it to the base of the             |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1055.82) | entire UI.                                                                                         |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1056.82) | Yeah, it's super cool.                                                                             |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1058.46) | Then there's also the line height unit.                                                            |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1060.54) | And this is the computed line height of the element.                                               |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1062.72) | So that's a unit that you can use in the future.                                                   |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1064.66) | Which is interesting because line height is both a property and a unit value.                      |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1068.9)  | You can set a line height, but then you can use that computed line height for other unit           |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1073.82) | values.                                                                                            |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1074.82) | So if you're doing vertical spacing, this could actually come in handy.                            |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1076.82) | Yeah, it sounds like a baseline alignment tool.                                                    |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1079.18) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1080.18) | And then there's also RLH, which is sort of like the REM to M for line height, where this          |
| [18:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1085.72) | is relative line height, that is the line height of the root elements.                             |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1089.3)  | So this is cool and all, but there's also no support.                                              |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1092.22) | Yeah, we'll figure those out soon here.                                                            |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1095.34) | Well, I think we should jump into viewport relative units.                                         |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1098.74) | What do you think about that?                                                                      |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1099.82) | Yeah, I think this is something that people are using every day.                                   |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1103.32) | And it's still new enough for people that they're not using all of the tools that we               |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1107.46) | have in this relative viewport unit toolbox.                                                       |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1110.54) | So I'd love to jump into that.                                                                     |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1112.02) | Yeah, same.                                                                                        |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1113.02) | All right, so we start with VW.                                                                    |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1114.02) | I feel like VH is probably the most popular, but here's VW, and this is viewport width.            |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1118.82) | And this is a relative unit to the viewport.                                                       |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1120.66) | So literally the entire viewport, and it represents a percentage of it.                            |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1124.38) | So you can do really cool font tricks with this, like resizing a header based on the               |
| [18:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1127.54) | width of the page.                                                                                 |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1128.74) | There's all sorts of cool tricks, but ultimately one VW would be 1% of viewport width and 100      |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1133.26) | VW would be 100% of the viewport width.                                                            |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1135.86) | Very cool.                                                                                         |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1136.86) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1137.86) | I use that trick some time with the font.                                                          |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1139.28) | There's also VH as Adam mentioned before, and this is 1% of a viewport's height instead            |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1144.02) | of the width.                                                                                      |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1145.02) | And you can use the height of the viewport to rearrange items in the UI.                           |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1148.68) | If you have like a footer toolbar, for example, you could rearrange how that looks on a page       |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1152.98) | by using the height of your viewport to create these sizing values or adjustments layout.          |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1158.26) | Yeah, there's a few bugs with the VH unit too to be aware of that are slowly getting               |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1162.3)  | resolved.                                                                                          |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1163.3)  | But ultimately, you know how like when you scroll on a webpage and the status bar disappears       |
| [19:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1166.1)  | and kind of becomes full screen, that's being recalculated as a new viewport height value          |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1171.64) | and it can cause a bunch of jank.                                                                  |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1173.1)  | So be careful with VH as it might be causing layout issues as the status bar goes away.            |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1178.58) | So that's something that browser vendors are working on resolving.                                 |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1181.14) | Good call on that.                                                                                 |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1182.14) | Thanks.                                                                                            |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1183.14) | I just like had to shout that out because I've been knee deep in the sort of logic of              |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1185.26) | it recently.                                                                                       |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1186.26) | Okay, so then there's also these other new units.                                                  |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1187.78) | So these are new ones for me and I love these.                                                     |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1189.62) | This is VI and this is 1% of the viewport's inline access.                                         |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1194.06) | So if we're talking about like logical properties where width is now your inline size and height   |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1199.1)  | is your block size, VI represents the viewport inline access and it allows you to sort of          |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1204.54) | request the width of the viewport based on the writing mode or reading mode that is being          |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1209.3)  | used in there.                                                                                     |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1210.3)  | So it's kind of cool.                                                                              |
| [20:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1211.3)  | It's very dynamic and contextual in nature.                                                        |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1213.46) | Yeah, where we have this viewport inline access, we need to also follow it up with a block         |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1217.58) | access.                                                                                            |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1218.58) | So we have the VB units.                                                                           |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1220.54) | I feel like I'm getting all the ones with no support and I need to caveat that.                    |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1223.3)  | This one also does not have any existing browser support.                                          |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1226.74) | So with this, like the inline access for VI, you have support for the block access, which          |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1231.26) | again changes based on the directionality of the language that your website is in that             |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1235.86) | is set on the page.                                                                                |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1236.86) | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1237.86) | All right.                                                                                         |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1238.86) | Well, the next one is well supported.                                                              |
| [20:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1239.86) | It's Vmin and this is a viewport unit, but it's going to take whichever one is the smallest,       |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1243.54) | the height or the width, the inline or the block.                                                  |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1246.3)  | And it's sort of interesting.                                                                      |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1247.3)  | You can sort of say Vmin and it's intelligent whether or not they're in landscape or portrait      |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1251.2)  | and can kind of give you some nice dynamic unit values that way.                                   |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1254.7)  | And if you think about a cell phone screen in front of you, the horizontal view when               |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1260.22) | it's in vertical mode is going to be the min next to the height of that.                           |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1264.58) | It's going to be a bigger dimension.                                                               |
| [21:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1265.58) | So that's going to be the Vmax.                                                                    |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1267.34) | So along with Vmin, we have the Vmax unit and this allows for you to get a percentage              |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1272.3)  | of the viewport's larger dimension.                                                                |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1274.22) | So if that phone is in the portrait mode, the Vmax larger dimension is going to be the             |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1279.38) | height, the Vmin is going to be the width of it.                                                   |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1283.06) | And then that's going to be the opposite when you flip that into a landscape mode.                 |
| [21:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1286.94) | Awesome.                                                                                           |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1287.94) | Thank you for clarifying that.                                                                     |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1288.94) | I really appreciate it.                                                                            |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1289.94) | All right.                                                                                         |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1290.94) | That covers relative font and absolute links.                                                      |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1292.54) | So remember those are font relative units that are absolute and relative.                          |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1297.06) | And just want to remind you that child elements do not inherit the relative values as specified    |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1301.04) | for the parent.                                                                                    |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1302.04) | They inherit the computed values.                                                                  |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1303.54) | And this is why Ms can scale themselves up or down when nested.                                    |
| [21:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1306.98) | So if you put an M and an M and an M and an M, they will shrink or grow recursively.               |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1312.18) | Or both.                                                                                           |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1313.18) | Yeah, or both.                                                                                     |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1314.18) | All right.                                                                                         |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1315.18) | Well, what else do we got, Yuna?                                                                   |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1316.18) | There are some other sizing quantities that we mentioned at the beginning of the show.             |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1319.54) | Angle units is one of those.                                                                       |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1321.06) | And these are great when you're talking about color.                                               |
| [22:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1323.34) | We mentioned these in our color part one episode, which was episode six.                           |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1327.52) | So check that out if you want to hear more about these in context.                                 |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1330.78) | But generally these quantities are awesome to know about and to use.                               |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1335.14) | The first one is the deg unit, D-E-G, which is the degrees.                                        |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1339.9)  | And that is, if you think of a circle, 360 makes a full rotation around the circle.                |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1344.18) | They go zero to 360.                                                                               |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1345.58) | You can actually write numbers that are larger than 360 in a deg and it'll just go back around     |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1350.26) | the circle.                                                                                        |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1351.26) | Or negative, it'll go the opposite way on the circle.                                              |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1353.9)  | So deg is pretty cool to use, especially when you're using it for a hue value in an HSL            |
| [22:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1358.62) | or LCH or any of those sort of color modes that have a rotation around a color wheel.              |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1363.7)  | Yeah, color wheels are a great way to think about it.                                              |
| [22:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1365.38) | And that's why some of these other angle units are, we have gradients and that's G-R-A-D,          |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1370.62) | grad or G-rad.                                                                                     |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1371.62) | And it's just another angle unit you can use, which is sweet.                                      |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1375.24) | And then there's rad to go with the grad and rad are radians and there are two pi radians          |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1379.78) | in a full circle.                                                                                  |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1380.78) | And you can also use turns.                                                                        |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1382.3)  | And I like turns just because it reads so well, but there's one turn in a full circle              |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1385.78) | and so you can do 0.5 turn and it would be half a turn or four turns.                              |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1389.66) | And it's just kind of a cool unit.                                                                 |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1391.02) | You can also think of sizing as time, not just length or dimensions around a color wheel.          |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1396.32) | And so in CSS, you can write S for seconds.                                                        |
| [23:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1400.38) | And MS for milliseconds.                                                                           |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1401.98) | And I do this all the time with my animations, right?                                              |
| [23:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1404.06) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1405.06) | Super fun.                                                                                         |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1406.06) | Use that all the time.                                                                             |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1407.06) | There's also frequency, which is for the speech API and you can write frequency in CSS, which      |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1411.86) | is super cool.                                                                                     |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1413.1)  | So the HZ unit, which is the first unit that I know of that has a capital in the first             |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1417.74) | letter of the unit is capital H lowercase Z.                                                       |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1420.02) | Oh, nice.                                                                                          |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1421.02) | That stands for Hertz and that represents the number of occurrences per second.                    |
| [23:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1424.42) | And naturally you can also use kilohertz K capital H Z.                                            |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1428.02) | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [23:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1429.02) | So this leaves us with the last sizing quantity, which is resolution and that's DPI.               |
| [23:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1433.74) | So the first one we have is DPI.                                                                   |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1435.02) | You might be using these in your media query and DPI stands for dots per inch.                     |
| [23:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1438.74) | There's also DPCM, which is dots per centimeter.                                                   |
| [24:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1442.94) | Fun fact, I didn't realize that of course, since there's dots per inch, there's gotta              |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1446.58) | be dots per centimeter unit.                                                                       |
| [24:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1448.5)  | I just thought that this is really interesting.                                                    |
| [24:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1450.18) | That's super interesting.                                                                          |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1451.18) | Then our last one here is DPPX, which is dots per pixel unit.                                      |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1456.06) | Wow.                                                                                               |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1457.06) | And you can use these in media queries.                                                            |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1459.38) | You can use at media and then a minimum resolution and then put retina specific styling in there.  |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1464.38) | So that's sort of where you're probably going to see these resolution values come into play.       |
| [24:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1468.86) | There's a ton of sizing units that we just went over in the show and it's nice to see              |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1471.82) | that you can write CSS not only for webpage layouts, but also for print.                           |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1476.02) | And there's so many ways to write color and even resolution and frequency inside of CSS.           |
| [24:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1481.14) | And so I had a lot of fun preparing for this show.                                                 |
| [24:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1483.14) | Did you?                                                                                           |
| [24:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1484.14) | Yeah, seriously.                                                                                   |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1485.14) | I think it follows well after our color one as well, just talking about CSS types and              |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1488.74) | units and all the ways that they can kind of be combined.                                          |
| [24:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1491.66) | And yeah, it's super cool, especially because we covered CMYK and talking about print.             |
| [24:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1495.74) | And so we have inches and CMYK.                                                                    |
| [24:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1497.1)  | It's just the web is neat.                                                                         |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68JoJ3go7Bat0pnyv4jIlT?&t=1498.62) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
