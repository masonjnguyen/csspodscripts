| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.          |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=17.32)   | Today we're going to get in the flow to talk about overflow.                                     |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=22.52)   | Overflow is how you deal with content that doesn't fit in a set parent size, like water          |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=28.3)    | overflowing a cup.                                                                               |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=30.4)    | What happens to that content?                                                                    |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=32.04)   | Does the box scroll to fit it?                                                                   |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=33.92)   | Do you just sort of crop it out?                                                                 |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=35.6)    | You adjust the content like you can with text overflow and add ellipses and indicate a cutoff    |
| [00:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=40.56)   | point.                                                                                           |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=41.6)    | There is so much to know about overflow.                                                         |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=45.6)    | Oh!                                                                                              |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=49.6)    | I just wanted to make that little pun.                                                           |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=51.48)   | I thought it would be fun.                                                                       |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=52.48)   | Nailed it.                                                                                       |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=53.48)   | I was unsuspecting and then as soon as it ended, I was very pleased.                             |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=58.28)   | So let's get into overflow a little bit.                                                         |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=61.16)   | The first thing to know about overflow is that there is a few different clipping options.        |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=64.6)    | So I mentioned text overflow.                                                                    |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=66.26)   | Text overflow is a bit unique because you set it on a parent element that has text inside        |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=71.56)   | of it like a paragraph and enables you as a developer to specify how you want the text           |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=76.7)    | to appear when it doesn't fit in the space available to that element.                            |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=81.24)   | So for example, I actually use this a lot for cards or a space where I have a uniform            |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=87.24)   | set of items that have varying inputs like a card for an article and you might want to           |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=94.48)   | do like a description of that article but it has a set amount of space for the description       |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=98.8)    | say like 300 by 200 pixel area.                                                                  |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=102.72)  | But that description might be you know a full paragraph and it might overflow the area.          |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=106.7)   | So with text overflow, you could set overflow options like the elements overflow and additional  |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=113.16)  | values like how you want the text to show up.                                                    |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=116.0)   | So clip is the default which just sort of like cuts it and then there's also another             |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=120.54)  | option of ellipses which is the little dot dot dots that you might see which indicate            |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=126.58)  | that there's more text that got cut off.                                                         |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=128.76)  | So it's pretty nice little shorthand.                                                            |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=130.88)  | And to set text overflow, you also need to set the element overflow which Adam will talk         |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=134.94)  | about in a second to hidden so that you are hiding overflow.                                     |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=139.88)  | And then also you need to have a white space value to prevent wrapping.                          |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=143.62)  | So you could do like white space no wrap so that the text overflow actually doesn't go           |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=148.92)  | on to the next line.                                                                             |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=149.92)  | You have to make sure that it's not wrapping.                                                    |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=151.54)  | So you need to combine it with a couple of things.                                               |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=154.3)   | This text overflow clipping option is reliant on other factors to be present as well.            |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=158.56)  | Yep, good call.                                                                                  |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=159.56)  | I mean yeah, element overflow is all about my children that I'm trying to contain.               |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=164.16)  | I can't contain them.                                                                            |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=165.32)  | I can contain them no more.                                                                      |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=166.92)  | And so yeah, sometimes that's text and sometimes that's a picture you know that's busting out    |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=171.12)  | of space.                                                                                        |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=172.12)  | So nice breakdown of text overflow.                                                              |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=174.28)  | I think it's really valuable that we have that ability.                                          |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=177.28)  | An element overflow is kind of like saying, hey, my children are requesting more space           |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=182.16)  | than I have available.                                                                           |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=183.48)  | And sometimes this is intentional.                                                               |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=185.0)   | It's like the design called for it, like a map, you know, an interactive map where you           |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=188.44)  | pan around in this window.                                                                       |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=190.24)  | But sometimes it's a surprise, like a user submitting an image that's got like 4K resolution     |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=195.6)   | for their avatar.                                                                                |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=196.6)   | And you're like, oh, I did not expect someone to upload something so large.                      |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=201.04)  | And so those are like the scenarios that you need to handle it.                                  |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=204.16)  | And I like to think of it kind of how Yunno is explaining in like a two-part concept where       |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=208.08)  | you have this window, something that's constrained, extrinsically sized space.                   |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=212.08)  | Like here's my card box space where text will go.                                                |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=215.64)  | And you have to specify that this is like a firm space for things.                               |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=219.28)  | And that firm space is what allows the child to sort of say, well, I need more.                  |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=223.48)  | And that above firm space becomes a window into the overflowing content.                         |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=228.1)   | So I like to think of them like a window and an oversized surface child.                         |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=232.12)  | And that's the relationship that you have even when like text is overflowing.                    |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=235.24)  | You have oversized amount of text that wants to go into a space and the window that you          |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=240.16)  | defined to kind of constrain it needs to say, well, what happens when it's doing that?           |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=244.48)  | And ellipsis is a great example.                                                                 |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=245.8)   | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=246.8)   | So like in the cup example, the window would be the cup and then the water overflowing,          |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=251.32)  | it will be the content.                                                                          |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=252.32)  | And you're trying to figure out how to fit that.                                                 |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=254.76)  | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=255.76)  | I like it.                                                                                       |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=256.84)  | Another weird thing about at least element overflow is it creates a block formatting             |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=260.08)  | context when you do it.                                                                          |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=261.22)  | So overflow hidden or overflow auto, these things will create, well, I guess overflow            |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=265.08)  | auto wouldn't, but, or would it?                                                                 |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=267.32)  | Cause it's scroll.                                                                               |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=268.32)  | What is its initial value?                                                                       |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=269.32)  | Do you remember?                                                                                 |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=270.32)  | Oh, visible.                                                                                     |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=271.32)  | So visible doesn't have a block for any context, but any other value does.                       |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=274.44)  | Okay, cool.                                                                                      |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=275.44)  | I just needed to review that for myself apparently.                                              |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=278.48)  | I like it live rubber ducking on air.                                                            |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=280.28)  | Well, that's how it goes.                                                                        |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=281.28)  | There's so many props.                                                                           |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=282.28)  | How do I remember all?                                                                           |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=283.28)  | Well, let's go over some of the props of element overflow while we're talking about it.          |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=287.12)  | The most common one that you're going to use is overflow Y.                                      |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=290.4)   | And so this is a physical overflow.                                                              |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=292.44)  | This is like the vertical access.                                                                |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=293.92)  | This is your, it's default on the HTML root element and you go up and down with your thumb,      |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=298.96)  | like on a screen, it's literally up and down, right?                                             |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=300.92)  | This is a physical Y overflow.                                                                   |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=303.36)  | And then you have overflow X, which is the horizontal access.                                    |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=307.0)   | This is left and right.                                                                          |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=308.0)   | And these are all based on the device viewport.                                                  |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=311.94)  | So yeah, those are kind of the two main ones that you have and they're physical based.           |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=315.48)  | Anyway, yeah.                                                                                    |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=316.48)  | Do you want to talk about the alternatives?                                                      |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=318.56)  | It's funny that you mentioned overflow Y as the one that you'll most likely use.                 |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=323.12)  | Cause I feel like overflow X is where developers are setting like overflow X to hidden, for      |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=328.28)  | example, to hide that overflow on the horizontal access a lot.                                   |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=332.2)   | So outside of X and Y, we also have overflow inline and overflow block.                          |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=336.9)   | So for these, you are setting the overflow for the inline start to inline end for overflow       |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=341.96)  | inline and block start to block end edges for overflow block for that box.                       |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=347.62)  | These are logical property based values and are only currently supported in Firefox.             |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=353.96)  | But if these terms are new to you, definitely check out our logical properties episode because   |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=358.52)  | we go over how these various access directions work based on the writing mode of your webpage.   |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=365.1)   | And we will explain like what inline and block mean in context.                                  |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=369.32)  | So within inline and block logical properties, there is the slew of additional properties        |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=374.8)   | that are starting to take over the X and Y property values to become inline and block            |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=379.12)  | instead.                                                                                         |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=380.12)  | So that they're a little bit more dynamic to writing mode.                                       |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=383.64)  | Very quickly, an example would be in English, the inline mode would be left to right horizontal  |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=389.0)   | and the block mode would be where the content flows.                                             |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=391.84)  | And that would be from top to bottom in English and Latin languages.                             |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=395.64)  | So that would map to overflow Y and the overflow inline would map to overflow X.                 |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=400.84)  | But then with overflow, there's also just the shorthand overflow.                                |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=405.08)  | And that is a shorthand for overflow X and overflow Y together.                                  |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=409.24)  | So you can write something like overflow hidden and then both X and Y are hidden.                |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=412.9)   | Or you could write overflow hidden visible and then just the X axis is hidden and the            |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=417.12)  | Y axis is visible.                                                                               |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=418.68)  | So that's just another example of how you can write overflow.                                    |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=422.0)   | Awesome and I just realized a CSS consistency in syntax.                                         |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=425.8)   | So our next episode is on background.                                                            |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=428.0)   | And when you specify background position, you have to start with the horizontal first,           |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=433.2)   | which is the same way in overflow here.                                                          |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=434.76)  | If you're going to use the shorthand, you have to say the horizontal one and then the            |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=437.96)  | vertical one.                                                                                    |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=438.96)  | And that's nice CSS that sort of my learning is carrying over across all these different         |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=444.12)  | sort of articulations.                                                                           |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=445.68)  | So anyway, that's a small little aside.                                                          |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=448.56)  | But yeah, okay, let's talk about values that you can put inside of these properties.             |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=453.08)  | So we just went over overflow X, Y, inline block and overflow shorthand.                         |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=456.88)  | So let's talk about what you can put as a value for those props.                                 |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=459.68)  | And the default is visible and to much frustration to a lot of people, the default is visible.   |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=464.7)   | Like given the webs and CSS's goals of never hide content or like safe layouts over precise      |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=470.52)  | layouts as tenants, it shouldn't be surprising the default values to not clip content.           |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=475.62)  | But it does surprise folks all the time.                                                         |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=477.58)  | Like when words pop out of their box, you know, like the example of the infamous CSS's           |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=481.96)  | awesome box that can't contain the phrase.                                                       |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=484.08)  | Yep.                                                                                             |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=485.08)  | So yeah, even if you specify a height for an element and you know the content inside             |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=487.92)  | is too large for that height, CSS slash the web will show the overflowing content by default.    |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=493.58)  | They don't clip like by default.                                                                 |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=496.04)  | So the following properties are ways for you to style this differently though, and control       |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=499.72)  | how the overflowing content is painted.                                                          |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=502.08)  | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=503.08)  | So next we have the hidden value.                                                                |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=505.0)   | And with hidden, when you're setting overflow to hidden, the content is clipped in the specified |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=509.32)  | direction or in just the shorthand both directions.                                              |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=512.12)  | And that just means that no scroll bars are provided to show the content.                        |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=515.44)  | So it's clipped and you don't get scroll bars.                                                   |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=518.12)  | You don't get the option to see that overflow content.                                           |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=520.68)  | And a common use of this is just on the body elements or another parent using overflow           |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=524.4)   | X hidden, especially when you're struggling with horizontal overflow and you don't know          |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=528.72)  | why.                                                                                             |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=529.72)  | It's sort of like the kill switch of setting overflow X to hidden.                               |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=533.58)  | But overflow hidden does still allow for programmatic scrolling.                                 |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=537.68)  | So if you wanted to write some scripts to apply scroll to that element, that is still            |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=542.16)  | available to you.                                                                                |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=543.16)  | Yeah, a tricky little sub note.                                                                  |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=545.02)  | Very nice.                                                                                       |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=546.22)  | The next value we have here is scroll.                                                           |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=548.68)  | And this is what I'm calling scroll bars for life mode.                                          |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=551.76)  | So you can set overflow scroll so that you always see the bars.                                  |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=556.44)  | Even if content isn't currently overflowing, show me them bars.                                  |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=560.22)  | These also will consume the space scroll bars take up as always and can be a nice option         |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=564.76)  | if you want to reduce layout shift for containers that may or may not have scroll bars like      |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=568.82)  | at runtime.                                                                                      |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=569.82)  | So, you know, like during resize, like you might not want those scroll bars to change            |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=574.08)  | layout.                                                                                          |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=575.08)  | So you could set scroll to well, you can set overflow to scroll so that these things are         |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=579.2)   | there even if it's not the end anyway.                                                           |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=581.2)   | So it just becomes this sort of reservation of space.                                            |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=583.5)   | You can normalize your container and prepare for scrollable areas.                               |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=587.52)  | So anyway, that's scroll.                                                                        |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=588.68)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=589.68)  | So the important use of scroll there is to make sure that you're not having layout shift         |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=593.84)  | and things aren't like moving around unexpectedly.                                               |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=595.96)  | So the next value is clip and clip like hidden enables the content to be clipped to the elements |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=601.92)  | padding box.                                                                                     |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=602.92)  | But the difference between clip and hidden is that the clip keyword also forbids all             |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=606.66)  | scrolling including programmatic scrolling.                                                      |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=609.3)   | So you can't get that element to scroll, it clips it for good.                                   |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=613.8)   | This value is not yet supported in any browsers, but it is in the future overflow specs.         |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=618.28)  | So currently you only really have access to overflow hidden if you want to hide that content.    |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=622.72)  | I think it's being prototyped or experimented to.                                                |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=625.04)  | I've seen activity on clip over the past few months.                                             |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=628.32)  | So yeah, look forward to that one.                                                               |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=630.0)   | The final value we have is auto and I think it's the most commonly used or it should be          |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=635.32)  | the most commonly used unless you're preventing, you know, layout shift or something like that.  |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=639.76)  | But it's sort of this idea of show them if you need to hide them if you don't respect            |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=643.76)  | the user's preference and do your thing browser.                                                 |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=646.5)   | So the browser has all these and the operating system have scroll bar options for the user       |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=650.76)  | and different operating systems have different types of scroll bars.                             |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=653.5)   | So setting it to auto is sort of like giving up the responsibility of how and why and what       |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=658.84)  | just and you're just saying I'd like them if they need to be there.                              |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=663.32)  | And so yeah, I like this because it respects the user agent or at least that's what the          |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=667.32)  | spec officially says is respects the user agent.                                                 |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=669.78)  | But to me that sort of means the user can bring their own flavor to the table and I'm            |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=674.36)  | respecting it.                                                                                   |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=675.36)  | So I like the value auto a lot.                                                                  |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=677.6)   | So we talked a bit about overflow and scroll bars, but where did those scroll bars live?         |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=683.08)  | In episode one we covered the box model.                                                         |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=685.4)   | Adam, do you remember where the scroll box go in the box model?                                  |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=689.16)  | I will be honest and I had to look it up again in today's episode.                               |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=693.8)   | I didn't know where it was in episode one and that was fun for me to learn and then              |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=697.88)  | I had to re-remember it's the padding box, which I suppose makes a ton of sense and they         |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=702.76)  | compete in there like if they're inline and they're not overlaid.                                |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=705.52)  | So that's where that they're going to go.                                                        |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=706.98)  | They could make you have too much space.                                                         |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=709.04)  | So that's one of the bummers if they're not in overlay mode, if they're in inline mode,          |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=713.68)  | they could be consuming an extra eight pixels of space and make your layout look all wrong       |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=718.72)  | and unsymmetrical.                                                                               |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=719.72)  | And that's where the layout shift comes in too.                                                  |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=721.96)  | If they appear when you're interacting with the element, then that will cause the layout         |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=725.96)  | shift.                                                                                           |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=726.96)  | Yep, definitely.                                                                                 |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=727.96)  | Well, there's another thing about scrolling I wanted to talk about because I've been doing       |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=730.44)  | a lot of research here and this is the root scroller versus implicit scrollers.                  |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=734.64)  | And this is kind of only something you might get into if you're building a mobile hybrid         |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=739.42)  | application or something and you're wondering how does and why does certain scrollers get        |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=744.64)  | the pull to refresh behavior, right?                                                             |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=746.96)  | You're on Chrome and you pull down on the body and you get that nice pull to refresh.            |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=749.8)   | Well, how do I get that in a nested scroller?                                                    |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=751.96)  | Can I put that in my own little tabs so that I could pull on a tab and get pulled to refresh?    |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=756.54)  | The answer is yes, but it's hard because there can only be one.                                  |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=760.1)   | So there's only one root scroller on your page and it does get a bunch of specialty              |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=764.36)  | features by the browsers right now.                                                              |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=766.16)  | And this was originally, it was the only one that would bounce, but now they kind of all         |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=769.36)  | tend to bounce.                                                                                  |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=770.48)  | You get a highlight on Android.                                                                  |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=771.76)  | So when you hit those edges, you kind of get that cool gradient highlight and you get pulled     |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=775.08)  | to refresh.                                                                                      |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=776.08)  | That's just an interesting distinguishing thing here between root scrollers and implicit         |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=781.04)  | scrollers.                                                                                       |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=782.04)  | And it's kind of a bummer that native doesn't have this, but we do.                              |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=784.96)  | We have to sort of promote a scroller.                                                           |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=787.1)   | So there's this thing called scroller promotion and it's really weird and I just want to         |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=790.08)  | share it fast, but it's like you can position a scroller in a way where a browser believes       |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=794.84)  | it's covering up all of the viewport or enough of the viewport that it will treat it as the      |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=799.48)  | root scroller or will replace it.                                                                |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=801.56)  | So you could take any app with a feed timeline like Twitter or something like that and make      |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=805.52)  | your feed the root scroller of the body by using this promotion technique.                       |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=810.2)   | So that's kind of one of the use cases of this is if you want your feed to have the              |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=813.64)  | pull to refresh, not the page, you can trick the browser into thinking your feed is the          |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=818.12)  | root scroller.                                                                                   |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=819.12)  | So it's like, okay, this was weird and then it just became helpful.                              |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=822.96)  | But there are additional sort of differences between implicit and root scrollers and if          |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=827.28)  | you're really savvy or really curious, go look those up.                                         |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=831.52)  | There's lots of niche little things about scrolling to learn.                                    |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=835.0)   | It's really fun.                                                                                 |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=836.44)  | There's two other scroll related UX properties I just wanted to bring up.                        |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=840.2)   | If you're trying to wrangle overflow, you're going to want to maybe think about scroll           |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=845.56)  | behavior or overscroll behavior.                                                                 |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=847.92)  | And so let's talk about scroll behavior.                                                         |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=849.28)  | This is a CSS property that lets you opt into browser controlled smooth scrolling to elements.   |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=853.6)   | It allows you to specify like if you click a link and it goes to a section header, do            |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=857.48)  | you want that to instantly go there or go there smoothly?                                        |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=860.14)  | And this lets you specify smooth.                                                                |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=862.12)  | I've also been putting this behind a reduced motion query.                                       |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=864.8)   | So like does the user prefer reduced motion?                                                     |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=867.52)  | They do then go instantly.                                                                       |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=869.02)  | If they're cool with motion, smooth scroll them there.                                           |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=871.36)  | So it's kind of cool.                                                                            |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=872.36)  | You can like even layer in user preferences into this UX enhancement.                            |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=875.56)  | Yeah, that's a really good idea.                                                                 |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=877.1)   | There's also overscroll behavior and this is to prevent overflow chaining.                       |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=881.16)  | So this is if you've ever been scrolling a modal overlay, like reading terms or whatever,        |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=884.84)  | got to the very bottom of the terms and then your scroll started scrolling the page behind       |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=888.76)  | the modal overlay and you're like, this is awkward.                                              |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=891.64)  | Or you go back to the top and all of a sudden the page starts to scroll to the top and you're    |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=895.52)  | like, okay, this is weird.                                                                       |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=897.04)  | And that's called scroll chaining.                                                               |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=898.22)  | That's your scroll interaction bubbling out or up into the container and into the next           |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=903.16)  | scroll area.                                                                                     |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=904.3)   | So it's like if you have inertia on your mouse, you'll find this all the time.                   |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=907.0)   | You'll fling and your fling will continue into the parent scroller and maybe even to             |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=911.32)  | the one above it.                                                                                |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=912.32)  | So the way to take control over that is with overscroll behavior and you can set that to         |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=915.98)  | contain on any of the accesses that you want, like X or Y.                                       |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=919.06)  | Yeah, I love that you mentioned scroll behavior when we're talking to overflow because it        |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=923.56)  | definitely is a factor when you have scroll bars that are coming into play or you're moving      |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=927.92)  | them.                                                                                            |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=928.92)  | So those are some good tips to know.                                                             |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=929.92)  | I especially like the one about the reducing the movement, the reduced animation property.       |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=937.56)  | Wait, what is it?                                                                                |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=938.56)  | Reduced?                                                                                         |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=939.56)  | It's prefers reduced motion.                                                                     |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=940.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=941.56)  | Prefers reduced motion.                                                                          |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=942.56)  | Oh my gosh.                                                                                      |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=943.56)  | I could not think of it.                                                                         |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=944.56)  | It was like on the tip of my tongue.                                                             |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=945.56)  | I was like, what is it?                                                                          |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=946.56)  | They are so tricky.                                                                              |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=947.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=948.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=949.56)  | So I think that's a really good pro tip.                                                         |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=950.82)  | There's also a future in which content may or may not be able to overflow into fragments         |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=957.22)  | or regions.                                                                                      |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=958.22)  | Ooh, totally.                                                                                    |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=959.72)  | So an example of this would be if you had some content, maybe like a book and you're             |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=964.12)  | writing a book and then you have various regions where that content can flow into or overflow    |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=969.62)  | into.                                                                                            |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=970.62)  | This is something if you're working with InDesign and you are styling a book, you have that      |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=973.98)  | where you set a flow region and you have text kind of flow and when it finishes and gets         |

| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=981.14)  | So this is kind of like what happens when it extends past that bounding box, it goes             |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=984.98)  | into the next region and so on and so forth.                                                     |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=987.0)   | So these are known as CSS regions and they don't exist on any modern browser, but there          |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=992.92)  | is very limited support in IE 11 from 2013 when this was starting to get experimented            |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=999.06)  | with.                                                                                            |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1000.82) | It's really hard to get regions working in the browser.                                          |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1002.62) | But anyway, this is something that a lot of folks have still been talking about in the           |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1005.22) | CSS Working Group and still want to get this, especially when mixed with things like Grid        |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1010.92) | and maybe Grid regions.                                                                          |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1012.74) | But there's still a lot of work for us to really get there.                                      |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1016.2)  | Just wanted to mention it because it is an overflow point that is a sort of hot topic            |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1020.82) | in CSS land.                                                                                     |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1021.82) | Yeah, that's cool because you're sort of like redirecting the water, right?                      |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1025.94) | You're like, I don't want the water just to overflow this way.                                   |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1028.94) | It's like I actually want to take the water and put it in this other box over here.              |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1033.58) | And it's a really cool concept.                                                                  |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1035.22) | Yeah, like into another vessel.                                                                  |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1037.66) | You're like, I have another cup.                                                                 |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3piht4fX3ZtNe59NOEW9Ou?&t=1039.66) | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                   |
