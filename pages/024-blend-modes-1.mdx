| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility                  |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=16.92)   | to z-index.                                                                                            |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=17.92)   | Today we're talking about CSS blend modes.                                                             |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=21.1)    | Blend modes are super fun and allow you to specify how you want elements to interact                   |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=25.56)   | in terms of their overlapping pixel values on the page.                                                |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=29.24)   | Yeah if you've ever held up two pieces of paper and put their corners overlapping or                   |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=33.2)    | maybe you just want to do that right now, this interaction of those corners and the                    |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=37.0)    | potentially transparent or maybe opaqueness of your layers will change the way that they               |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=42.16)   | blend and how they blend and the way that they affect each other and the way that they                 |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=46.12)   | composite into a single color in your eyes is what we're talking about.                                |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=50.56)   | So there are two different types of blend modes.                                                       |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=52.96)   | The first is mixed blend mode and the second is background blend mode.                                 |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=56.86)   | With mixed blend mode you can enable an element to layer on top of any other element and blend         |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=62.96)   | with it anywhere on the page.                                                                          |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=64.96)   | So with mixed blend mode if I had a blend mode applied to say a paragraph of text that                 |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=70.26)   | had some sort of color behind it, that entire paragraph with the color behind it would blend           |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=74.0)    | with anything that was behind it on the page.                                                          |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=76.88)   | Now with background blend mode this confines the blend interaction to the composite within             |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=81.36)   | the elements background layers.                                                                        |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=83.32)   | So elements themselves could have multiple backgrounds including a mix of different images             |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=87.88)   | or gradients with images or colors with images and background blend mode would have these              |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=92.94)   | background layers blend within the element itself.                                                     |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=95.72)   | So it sort of isolates the blending to just the background of that specific element and                |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=101.44)  | this can be handy too because you can add some texture and a single element.                           |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=105.28)  | I just did a lot of fun texture adding with blend modes to the wedding website that I'm                |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=108.76)  | working on.                                                                                            |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=109.76)  | So I've been having actually a ton of fun with blend modes right now.                                  |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=112.58)  | Those are fun and I bet they're adding a bunch of really cool effects.                                 |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=115.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=116.64)  | Okay so we have mixed blend mode and background blend mode and they both take a blend mode             |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=121.36)  | as a value so they can only have one at a time it looks like and the way that I was                    |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=125.9)   | hearing mixed blend mode versus background blend mode is very much of yeah this element                |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=130.04)  | that I'm applying this to.                                                                             |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=131.8)   | Do I want everything inside of it to be affected by this blend style or do I want just the             |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=136.24)  | background?                                                                                            |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=137.24)  | So anyway it was just recapping it but that was really nice.                                           |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=139.48)  | No it's a good recap.                                                                                  |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=140.9)   | Okay so it takes a blend mode what are blend mode values that I can pass?                              |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=144.2)   | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=145.2)   | What's next?                                                                                           |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=146.2)   | Before we talk about the blend mode values I do want to note that unlike CSS filters                   |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=149.92)  | which we talked about on our last episode blend modes are not interoperable so you can't               |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=155.36)  | animate blend modes and the reason why is because there's no values to shift between.                  |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=160.44)  | They're types of interactions.                                                                         |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=162.34)  | They're either on or off.                                                                              |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=164.0)   | So if you want to apply these effects gradually in a transition I would recommend pairing              |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=168.62)  | them with filters to give the illusion of transition over time because filters do animate              |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=174.02)  | but with blend modes specifically it's sort of a sudden change so I would recommend using              |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=178.84)  | them not for animated things or hovers and focus states I would recommend using them                   |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=182.34)  | more for overall visual effects on the page.                                                           |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=185.7)   | Good strong tip.                                                                                       |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=186.7)   | I totally agree.                                                                                       |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=188.16)  | We do want to kind of categorize these blend modes before we go tell you about all of them             |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=192.8)   | because there's opposing strategies for categorization so the way that the spec puts these is between  |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=198.54)  | two different types of blend modes.                                                                    |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=200.28)  | So all blend modes to the spec fall under these two different types.                                   |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=203.08)  | They're separable and non-separable.                                                                   |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=205.08)  | A non-separable blend mode is considering all components and combination before it applies             |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=210.18)  | its effect versus separable where it can apply just one at a time.                                     |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=213.96)  | So like a non-separable effect would be hue saturation color and luminosity.                           |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=219.08)  | These effects these blend modes are done against all the combination of components versus if           |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=224.12)  | you wanted to do multiply screen or overlay these are separable so they can work as an                 |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=228.56)  | individual so just kind of that's how the spec separates them but I think Una has a                    |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=232.9)   | better way of separating them.                                                                         |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=234.5)   | Do you want to tell us how you group them in your mind?                                                |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=236.62)  | Well when we were talking about like categorizing these things the way that I've seen them categorized |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=241.88)  | is how Adobe defines them and so within Photoshop and within other applications you'll see them        |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=246.84)  | sort of broken up into these categories and the first one is normal blending mode so there's           |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=250.66)  | normal in Photoshop there's also dissolve there are more blend modes that exist in design              |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=255.88)  | software than do in the browser but many of these do exist in the browser so there's the               |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=260.08)  | normal blending mode types and there's the darken blending modes which would include                   |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=263.44)  | dark and multiply color burn lighten blending modes as another category which is lighten               |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=268.2)   | screen color dodge contrast blending modes to adjust or increase decrease contrast which               |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=273.52)  | is overlay soft light and hard light there's inversion blending modes which are difference             |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=278.16)  | and exclusion and both of these are very similar to each other but have one key difference             |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=282.92)  | and then finally there is component blend modes which are hue saturation color luminosity              |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=288.6)   | so these would be the separable blend modes that the web spec defines but in this design               |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=293.96)  | software they're considered component blend mode because they take one specific component              |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=299.16)  | of the active layer which is the source layer and they're using that to blend on to the                |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=305.24)  | background layer so it's sort of like the same concept where they take a specific component            |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=310.2)   | and they're using that as the key in which you are blending awesome or two in the case                 |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=314.74)  | of color and I think that makes way more sense when I reflect on my usage of blend modes               |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=319.96)  | just in my brain I drop them into these categories and maybe it's a little bit of training from        |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=323.62)  | Photoshop but definitely darkening and lightening and contrasting and inversion these are the          |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=328.24)  | things I'm trying to do with a blend mode as I'm trying to create these interactions                   |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=332.28)  | of what these have so totally I like yours better I mean it's not on the spec to sort                  |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=336.34)  | of create a nice grouping of these anyway so that's what we're here for you did a great                |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=341.08)  | job yeah okay so let's just go down this list of blend modes we have the first one is normal           |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=346.12)  | and shouldn't be very surprising but this is the default attribute when you have no                    |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=349.6)   | blending and the blending formula pretty much says use the source color next we have multiply          |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=354.28)  | which I think is one of the most commonly used blend modes and so the way that I like                  |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=359.32)  | to explain this is it's like taking two images and putting them on an overhead projector               |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=364.08)  | like remember back in grade school where you had overhead projectors and you would project             |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=368.96)  | slides oh yeah and so if you put two slides on top of each other the white the transparent             |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=375.9)   | value would shine through so you would see through to the background layer the black                   |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=382.38)  | or dark value stay dark and then when you have medium values you multiply their darkness               |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=387.2)   | so they actually become darker so like if you had like a blue and a green layer on top                 |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=391.32)  | of each other it would become a darker value so multiplying any color with black would                 |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=395.8)   | result in black multiplying any color with white would preserve the original color behind              |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=400.18)  | it and multiply essentially allows for you to physically multiply the luminosity values                |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=406.76)  | of these pixels to multiply the color values just think of it like a I think projector                 |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=410.88)  | screen is a good way to think of it yeah no that was good a lot of these come in pairs                 |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=414.72)  | too so you'll notice that when one explains itself the next one is often the inverse of                |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=419.96)  | the previous one and so the next one we have here is screen and it's the inverse of multiply           |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=425.56)  | so it's like multiplying the light values instead of multiplying the dark values so                    |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=428.8)   | the result is always at least as light or either of the two things that you're putting                 |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=432.44)  | together and screening any color with white produces white and screening with black leaves             |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=437.7)   | the original color unchanged so this is how you can use this to sort of like make whites               |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=443.2)   | whiter and your blacks the same yeah you're like multiplying the light values this time                |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=447.0)   | so the dark values yep so next we have overlay and the overlay blend mode is interesting               |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=451.46)  | because it is a mix of both the multiply and screen blend modes where you're multiplying               |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=456.4)   | dark areas and screening light areas and that's why this is considered a contrast type of              |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=460.84)  | blend mode it preserves the highlights and the shadows and areas that are dark become                  |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=466.34)  | darker light areas become lighter it depends on how you are mixing them what you're mixing             |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=471.32)  | but the background is primarily responsible for the highlights and shadows like a black                |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=474.8)   | and white photo while the top layer dictates the change of dark or light and 50% gray areas            |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=480.4)   | are unaffected next we have darken which selects the darker of the backdrop and the source             |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=485.36)  | colors right it's just going to darken the picture so simply put that doesn't actually                 |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=489.94)  | blend any pixels it compares the base and the top layers luminosity values and then                    |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=494.34)  | it keeps the darkest of the two so the backdrop is replaced with the source wherever the source        |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=498.8)   | is darker so otherwise it's the same image that was there before and like darken but                   |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=503.92)  | the opposite is lightened so again this doesn't actually blend pixels it compares the base             |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=509.4)   | and top layers luminosity values of those two color values and it keeps the lightest                   |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=514.46)  | of the two so when lightening or darkening vivid colors you can get some pretty interesting            |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=518.88)  | results like if you're comparing like an orange and a thistle kind of color it's going to              |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=524.08)  | look at every RGB value and pick which one is either darker or lighter and it pulls that               |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=529.6)   | one out to make a new color value so you can see some really interesting results and some              |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=534.64)  | colors kind of coming out where you didn't expect them to with darken and lighten and                  |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=538.48)  | that's how they're different from multiply and screen where you're using the RGB values                |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=543.18)  | instead of the luminosity the alpha layer values when you're applying these transformations            |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=548.52)  | awesome next we have color dodge which brightens the backdrop color to reflect the source              |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=554.0)   | color it's like if you paint with black it's not going to do anything it's a similar effect            |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=558.18)  | that you'd get from the dodge tool to lighten an image so that's color dodge and there's               |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=562.16)  | also color burn and that's a similar effect that you get from the burn tool to darken                  |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=566.2)   | an image and you know dodge and burn come from photography when you had to like manually               |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=570.14)  | apply these adjustments using hiding and showing of light in different places to adjust the            |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=577.04)  | color value that you're getting from the resultant photograph which is kind of cool but this           |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=583.84)  | color burn effect gives you a darker result than multiply since it increases the contrast              |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=589.32)  | between the base and top layers more resulting in more saturated midtones and reducing the             |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=594.32)  | highlights so with color when you get more saturated contrasted results and a white layer              |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=599.66)  | on top would produce no change with color burn lovely that gave me a really nice visual                |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=605.28)  | okay we have hard light which is next and that's multiplies or screens the colors depending            |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=609.98)  | on the source color value so it's a little dynamic the effect is similar to shining a                  |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=613.88)  | harsh spotlight on the backdrop and then we have soft light which is similar to shining                |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=618.88)  | a diffused spotlight on the background so this is also similar to overlay without that                 |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=623.6)   | harsh contrast and it too applies either darkening or lightening depending on the luminance values     |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=629.04)  | but in a much more subtle way than hard light would we have difference so this is one of               |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=633.24)  | the in your category earlier of the contrast creations creation of blend modes so difference           |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=638.52)  | is useful for lining up layers it's identical pixel values turn black so anything that's               |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=643.88)  | the same will turn black subtracts the darker of the two constituent colors from the lighter           |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=648.1)   | color and painting with white inverts the backdrop color while painting with black produces            |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=654.1)   | no change I did like a little talk on blend modes and for difference I did one of those                |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=660.08)  | you know those like kids puzzles where you're like searching for what's the difference between         |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=663.52)  | these two images yeah so you could take those two images layer them on top of each other               |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=668.64)  | apply the difference blend mode on the top layer and you'll see all the differences you'll             |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=672.74)  | see where everything stands out as not fitting identically as pixels which I think is like             |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=678.2)   | a fun thing that's really cool I wonder if like Instagram or Squoosh could use that where              |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=683.32)  | you're kind of comparing a new affected image to an old one I wonder if this could help                |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=687.58)  | you see what you've lost or gained I don't know interesting yeah so I built a little                   |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=693.08)  | website called diffy.me and it shows you the visual diff between any two pages like any                |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=698.96)  | two web pages any two like you can show like production versus local and it just used the              |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=703.66)  | different blend mode with iframes as like a way to do this no way yeah so that was like                |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=708.22)  | wow tricky yeah cool I keep thinking of all the pathfinder tools with this like difference             |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=713.24)  | and exclusion these make me think of when I have shapes that are overlapping and what                  |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=716.92)  | do I want to do with those paths Sonya very cool it's very similar but with pixels yeah                |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=721.18)  | no exactly that's a good way to think of it too so exclusion is really similar to difference           |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=725.94)  | in the mode of operating but with exclusion identical pixels have a 50% gray value instead             |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=732.46)  | of a black value so this results in much less contrasted outcomes and much more subtle outcomes        |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=739.06)  | and painting with white again inverts the backdrop color painting with black produces                  |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=743.8)   | no change and then you're looking at the differences between those pixel values crazy okay so now      |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=749.8)   | we're into the component blend modes or the non-separable blend modes as the spec likes                |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=754.24)  | to call them and the first one we have here is hue and this creates a color with the hue               |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=758.68)  | of the source color and the saturation and luminosity of the backdrop color with saturation            |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=764.0)   | you are blending just the saturation of the source color that top color that you're applying           |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=768.84)  | this to with the hue and luminosity of the background so for example a bright yellow                   |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=774.96)  | flooded layer would just increase the saturation of the image behind it but you would still            |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=779.48)  | be able to discern the image as it keeps its original hue and lightness and darkness values            |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=785.68)  | very cool we have color which creates a color with the hue and saturation of the source                |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=790.14)  | color and the luminosity of the backdrop color so this preserves the gray levels of the background     |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=795.12)  | and is useful for coloring monochrome images or tinting color images nice I think this                 |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=800.68)  | is really cool because it combines the hue and saturation which is the only blend mode                 |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=804.56)  | that is in the non-separable category that uses two of the HSL values and so just like                 |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=811.24)  | you said you can apply color to a grayscale image and you wouldn't know the difference                 |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=816.56)  | between if that image was grayscale behind it or if it was colored behind it because                   |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=819.92)  | you're still pulling the hue and saturation of the source layer on top of it on the image              |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=824.68)  | so I think it's kind of cool in that way and then the opposite of that would be luminosity             |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=831.6)   | so this would enable for you to have a color behind the image and then you apply the luminosity        |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=837.84)  | blend mode to that source layer on top and this would keep just the luminosity so the                  |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=844.6)   | dark and light values of that source you're applying it to while showing the hue and saturation        |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=850.08)  | of the background so it's totally the opposite so I like to say that if you want to use blend          |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=855.8)   | modes you can definitely use color luminosity interchangeably by making sure that you have             |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=862.68)  | a visual image available to your users as the top layer and then if you want to blend                  |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=868.4)   | it with the color behind it you can use something like luminosity instead of having a plane            |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=873.24)  | of color above the image and using something like color to blend it back seriously as soon             |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=878.48)  | as you started explaining it I was like this is genius because yeah the fallback scenario              |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=882.6)   | is so much stronger in the recommendation here where the color is behind the image and                 |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=887.8)   | you're just sort of upgrading the experience yes if everything is okay very cool all right             |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=893.6)   | well okay so something critical to talk about in all this which is probably not covered                |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=898.38)  | very often is isolation and isolation in CSS is specifically around blend modes here and               |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=904.92)  | what we want to do is help break down this concept to you hopefully and the way that                   |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=909.48)  | I thought of it easiest is in terms of like Photoshop with an adjustment layer there was               |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=914.66)  | always this icon underneath your adjustment layer that said whether or not you were affecting          |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=918.8)   | everything or just the group and layer that you were a part of and that's exactly what                 |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=923.48)  | isolation is doing here so just like in Photoshop where you could either affect everything with        |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=927.28)  | this blend mode or isolate it somewhere right good little keyword we can now do that in                |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=931.4)   | CSS so if you set isolation to isolate in CSS you will get a stacking context and the                  |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=939.14)  | elements inside will mix with themselves and not with the background whereas if you want               |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=943.36)  | them to mix with that background you don't want to isolate the mix blend mode and you'll               |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=947.48)  | get the traditional behavior so you do have that finite control with these blend modes                 |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=952.3)   | when you're looking at how two layers are mixing together should they go completely                    |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=956.9)   | all the way to the background or should they be contained with inside of the group that                |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=960.44)  | they're in so neat anyway yeah super useful to use that as well so that's the end of our               |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=966.08)  | show about blend modes we want to thank you for joining us I think that this is a really               |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=971.4)   | unique topic that can be used with so much in the browser you can use this to blend images             |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=978.68)  | that you don't have to specifically edit in a design software first directly on your page              |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=984.08)  | you can use this for various effects you can use it to increase the contrast even of the               |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=990.92)  | elements on your page you can use it to blend things in a way that goes across individual              |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=996.74)  | sections and make your web page way less boxy I don't know I think that like there's so                |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1002.68) | many possibilities I'm not even articulating them correctly but with CSS blend modes and               |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1007.2)  | filters which is what our last episode was about I think there's a lot of cool creative                |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1010.44) | things that you can do just directly in the browser absolutely creating texture it's responsive        |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1015.0)  | to remember like if you're in Photoshop and you're making a cool logo with some overlapping            |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1019.08) | letters and blend modes which is still cool looking I think just do it in the browser                  |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1023.32) | make it responsive why don't you do some variable typography you can really do some neat stuff         |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OBjg2LukmwWTKzs4fA0AJ?&t=1027.68) | these days in the browser and that magical piece of paper that we get to code and describe             |
