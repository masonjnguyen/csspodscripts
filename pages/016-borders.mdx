| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.         |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=17.92)   | Today we're talking about borders, and while this sounds relatively simplistic, borders          |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=22.22)   | in CSS can actually get pretty complex very quickly.                                             |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=25.92)   | It's not just color and style that you can adjust, but also you can add border images,           |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=30.28)   | where you control how the image repeats itself, and what slice of the image you want to show.    |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=35.68)   | So Adam, what exactly is a border in CSS?                                                        |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=38.82)   | Where does it live?                                                                              |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=39.82)   | Yes, I reflect back to our box model episode where we talk about where each of these properties  |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=44.36)   | live in relation to the box.                                                                     |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=46.86)   | And so our border, if we go from the inside out, we have our content, and then we have           |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=50.9)    | our padding, and then we have our border box.                                                    |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=53.98)   | The border box, if we go back to our photo frame metaphor, which was super rad, we have          |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=58.28)   | this art wall, and we have nine pictures, let's say.                                             |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=61.78)   | The images and art inside of each of those is the content.                                       |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=65.2)    | The photo matte, so the kind of colored spacing between the border and the content itself,       |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=70.04)   | is your padding.                                                                                 |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=71.04)   | It's like the background color too, even you could think of.                                     |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=73.56)   | But then you have the border, so that's the frame of your image here.                            |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=77.24)   | And that frame could be small or large, and it can take up space, or it can take up no           |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=81.84)   | space.                                                                                           |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=82.96)   | And in CSS, we have another property called box sizing, which can help you determine whether     |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=87.08)   | or not that border should be part of the space in the page, or if this should be just a drawn    |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=91.8)    | space.                                                                                           |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=93.06)   | And so hopefully that's a good recap of where borders live, and on a photo, they're just         |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=97.52)   | the frame.                                                                                       |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=98.52)   | Yeah, and I think that that was a great explanation.                                             |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=100.58)  | The key here is borders, like frames, can be thick or thin, but they do take up space            |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=106.56)  | in the area in which they live.                                                                  |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=108.72)  | That is geometric space on the page.                                                             |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=111.28)  | When you add borders, things might geometrically shift on the page.                              |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=114.5)   | It provides additional space.                                                                    |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=116.48)  | So if you want to write border properties, the first one I think of is border color.             |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=120.8)   | Pretty straightforward, a color for your border.                                                 |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=123.44)  | And so border color itself is a shorthand for border top color, right color, border              |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=128.26)  | bottom color, and border left color.                                                             |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=130.52)  | So you can have all of those get the same value with one value, or you can put one,              |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=135.48)  | two, three, or four colors in there and have all the different borders have different colors.    |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=141.04)  | And the initial value for your border color is current color.                                    |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=144.4)   | So if you had a card with red text, say the color of the text was red, the property for          |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=150.28)  | color was red, then your border color would be red by default.                                   |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=154.76)  | But you can't just set a border color without setting a border width and style.                  |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=159.06)  | It just won't show up.                                                                           |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=160.24)  | So we need that next property, border width, to see something.                                   |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=163.88)  | Yeah, border's kind of weird like that.                                                          |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=165.48)  | It turns out the default for border width is medium, but just like you're saying, you            |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=169.84)  | kind of need this perfect little combo, almost like a recipe in order for your border to         |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=174.42)  | show up.                                                                                         |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=175.42)  | And so even though the default width of a border is medium, you don't see it unless              |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=179.08)  | you set a style to something.                                                                    |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=181.28)  | And with the style default is none, the width doesn't matter.                                    |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=184.06)  | So it's kind of like a weird little thing that yeah, you have to have all the ingredients        |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=187.16)  | of the recipe to see your border.                                                                |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=189.14)  | Kind of funny, but I don't know.                                                                 |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=190.2)   | I'm sure it made sense for some reason back then.                                                |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=192.64)  | Border width does have all the same thing.                                                       |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=193.74)  | So if top right, bottom left with widths, you can reference them individually or all             |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=197.08)  | together.                                                                                        |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=198.08)  | You can make a length unit, so something of some sort of distance, but they have three           |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=201.52)  | special keywords that you can use too in case you want, thin, medium, and thick.                 |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=205.28)  | So kind of fun.                                                                                  |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=206.28)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=207.28)  | And so the next property that we need is style, border style, which is top right, bottom left    |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=212.42)  | again.                                                                                           |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=213.42)  | And there are a few different styles that you can have for your borders.                         |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=216.68)  | So the first one is none, but if you want a border, you likely want to have a different          |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=221.96)  | style.                                                                                           |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=222.96)  | You would put border style none if you're trying to remove a border, however.                    |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=225.72)  | But the other styles are dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset.        |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=234.68)  | And so for dotted and dashed, so dotted is like dots, like polka dots, but in a straight         |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=239.44)  | line around your elements.                                                                       |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=242.64)  | And then dashed is sort of like if you have ever used like a design tool and you have            |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=248.28)  | the lasso, there's like a dashed animated movement around the lasso area.                        |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=254.2)   | Oh yeah, the dancing ants or whatever.                                                           |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=256.6)   | The dancing ants.                                                                                |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=257.6)   | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=258.6)   | So it's like little marching ants.                                                               |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=259.8)   | And the width of your border will actually affect the size of the dots and the dashes            |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=263.88)  | here as well.                                                                                    |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=264.88)  | The one that I use most often, just a solid border based on your width.                          |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=268.56)  | With double, you have two borders and a space between them.                                      |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=273.54)  | And again, the width that you apply there is going to affect how thick the space between         |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=277.52)  | the borders are as well as the border width themselves.                                          |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=280.0)   | So it's like two solid borders, like inset from each other.                                      |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=283.92)  | And then for groove ridge, inset and outset, you actually have multiple colors here.             |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=288.52)  | You have a lighter value and a darker value.                                                     |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=291.08)  | And for this, the browser will darken the border color for the second value shown.               |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=296.3)   | It doesn't lighten it, it darkens it.                                                            |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=298.14)  | So if you had an inset with the border color being red, the browser would darken it to           |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=304.16)  | like a maroon shade.                                                                             |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=305.92)  | And for inset, it would be the top left color would have the darker shade.                       |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=309.4)   | For outset, the bottom right color has the darker shade.                                         |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=312.16)  | So inset looks like you're pushing it in because the shadow is on the bottom.                    |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=316.8)   | If the shadow was coming from the top, it would look like it's pushed in.                        |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=319.88)  | For outset, if you're looking at the light coming from the top, I mean, for both these.          |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=323.56)  | If the light was coming from the top, the light would be brighter on top and darker              |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=327.28)  | on bottom if it was pushed out.                                                                  |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=328.84)  | If the light is coming from the top, the light is brighter on the bottom and darker from         |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=332.16)  | the top.                                                                                         |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=333.16)  | And that's where inset looks like it's pushed in.                                                |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=335.76)  | And then for groove and ridge, groove has the dark light pattern that inset does, but            |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=342.48)  | it has the dark light pattern on both the top left and bottom right.                             |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=346.82)  | And it repeats.                                                                                  |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=347.9)   | So where inset has it dark entirely on the top and left, groove would have it dark top           |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=353.6)   | left and bottom right.                                                                           |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=355.32)  | And then inset has it light on the bottom and right.                                             |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=358.72)  | I hope that this makes sense.                                                                    |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=360.36)  | I am describing to you a visual and I hope that you play with this later to like kind            |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=364.84)  | of get the look and feel of it.                                                                  |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=366.48)  | For ridge and not groove, you have a lighter value on the top, darker value next to that         |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=372.28)  | in the top and left borders, and then the bottom and right borders, it's the same                |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=376.68)  | where you have the lighter value on the left and top and darker value on the bottom and          |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=381.22)  | right of those.                                                                                  |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=382.68)  | So imagine a ridge and this isn't what you think of when you think of ridge.                     |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=389.08)  | So another thing to note with the colorization of this, if you have a dark border color,         |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=394.76)  | like black, in Chrome, you're not going to see the highlight at all for the outset,              |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=399.88)  | inset, ridge and groove.                                                                         |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=400.88)  | It's just going to look like a solid border.                                                     |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=403.42)  | And in Firefox, just for black, it becomes gray.                                                 |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=407.5)   | So if your color is like a really dark gray, you're going to see a little bit of a difference,   |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=413.32)  | but not much.                                                                                    |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=414.32)  | It'll still look pretty solid.                                                                   |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=415.48)  | However, if you set your border to the keyword of black or like the color black, whether         |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=419.68)  | that's a hex or HSL or anything, it's going to actually change the border to be a gray           |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=425.56)  | color.                                                                                           |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=426.56)  | It's not going to be black.                                                                      |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=427.56)  | It's going to lighten both the lighter value and the darker value there.                         |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=430.12)  | So that's just a little fun fact.                                                                |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=431.48)  | If you are playing with these border styles and colors and you see sort of what you weren't      |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=435.96)  | expecting, it's because the browser is trying to create this outset, inset, ridge, and a         |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=440.32)  | groove style.                                                                                    |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=441.32)  | And it's not able to do that when the color is black.                                            |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=443.96)  | It can't darken black anymore.                                                                   |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=445.4)   | So it needs to do something else to get that style looking right.                                |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=448.68)  | Nice, no good examples.                                                                          |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=450.4)   | And I love these because they really mark the web and its time for when they came out            |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=455.28)  | because groove and inset and ridge.                                                              |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=458.24)  | And these just look so silly and dated.                                                          |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=461.12)  | They just remind me of like right before web 2.0, like right before everything became all        |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=465.0)   | gooey and liquidy and you know, like shiny and glossy right before that everything was           |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=469.68)  | so ridged.                                                                                       |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=471.16)  | Everything had a light and a dark shadow was lifted off the page or it was inset into the        |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=475.24)  | page and looked like the buttons on our VCRs.                                                    |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=478.12)  | Yeah, but in like a very specific way.                                                           |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=481.36)  | So you don't have much control over it.                                                          |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=483.64)  | Yeah, I almost want to build a site exclusively with these as the style mechanism because        |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=488.16)  | it would just be hilarious.                                                                      |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=489.84)  | Anyway, I thought you did a really good job on those.                                            |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=492.52)  | Brutalism on the web is trendy.                                                                  |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=494.96)  | The next thing we have for borders here is all the shorthands and there's some really,           |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=499.0)   | really neat shorthands here.                                                                     |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=500.0)   | So the first one that you probably have used if you want to border on all sides is just          |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=503.88)  | a border colon one pixel solid red or something like that and that would give you a one pixel    |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=509.36)  | solid red border around every edge and sets all four sides for you at once.                      |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=514.08)  | That's all four styles for you at once and sets all four widths for you at once.                 |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=517.88)  | You know, all three.                                                                             |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=518.88)  | It's great.                                                                                      |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=519.88)  | Super rad shorthand, really powerful.                                                            |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=522.12)  | Then we also have shorthands for the individual properties.                                      |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=525.16)  | You can say border width, border style, border color and each of those can take one, two,        |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=529.12)  | three or four different values so that it would know if it needs to put this on all              |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=533.56)  | the sides or some of the pairs.                                                                  |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=535.32)  | So it works just like margin.                                                                    |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=536.84)  | And then you also have shorthand for border top, right bottom left.                              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=540.36)  | So you can say border top is two pixels solid dashed or two pixels dashed red and you could      |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=546.72)  | set border bottom to something else.                                                             |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=549.0)   | But we have some new ones.                                                                       |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=550.48)  | So those probably weren't very new sounding to you.                                              |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=553.36)  | Those are normal.                                                                                |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=554.4)   | But we also have logical property shorthands and these I find are very handy.                    |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=558.52)  | We have border dash block and border dash inline and border dash block.                          |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=562.92)  | What you're setting is the top and the bottom, at least in a Latin language, the top and         |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=566.32)  | the bottom borders.                                                                              |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=567.64)  | So in one shorthand you can say I want a one pixel solid black line on the top and the           |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=572.24)  | bottom and then you could put a different one on the left and the right and say border           |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=575.76)  | inline one pixel dashed red.                                                                     |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=578.6)   | And so you can specify left and the right or top and the bottom as a pair now by using           |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=583.48)  | the super handy dandy logical property shorthands for border.                                    |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=587.92)  | Oh, it looks like there's actually even a couple more nested ones that I forgot.                 |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=590.88)  | So a border block width, border block style, border block color.                                 |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=594.08)  | So just like how we had shorthands for border width style color, we have logical property        |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=598.28)  | equivalence as well as a border block with style color or border inline with style color.        |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=602.56)  | Cool.                                                                                            |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=603.56)  | So that's all the shorthands for border.                                                         |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=605.32)  | Next topic is the radius of your border or a border radius where you could have the border       |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=610.96)  | top left radius, border top right radius, border bottom right radius or the border bottom        |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=617.04)  | left radius.                                                                                     |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=618.26)  | That is the breakdown of border radius because it is on the angle, it's on the corner.           |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=622.9)   | You don't just get like the top right bottom left.                                               |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=625.8)   | You have to specify top left, top right, bottom right and bottom left.                           |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=630.68)  | Or as Adam was talking about with logical properties, it's start start, start end,               |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=637.16)  | end start and end end.                                                                           |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=639.22)  | So if you're writing with logical properties, like remember the way that you're going to         |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=642.0)   | be converting things and this could be a number or a length presented.                           |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=645.38)  | So your radius could be 50%.                                                                     |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=647.8)   | It could be 10 pixels.                                                                           |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=649.92)  | And usually we see one value here for border radius.                                             |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=654.18)  | But did you know that it's actually a shorthand property?                                        |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=657.24)  | Border radius is a shorthand that repeats that you have two values for.                          |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=662.92)  | So you can write border top left radius 2 rem 30% if you wanted to.                              |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=668.52)  | And this is going to set the border top left, the top side of that to 2 rems and the border      |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=675.32)  | top left, left side to 30%.                                                                      |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=679.02)  | So you can have these sort of differentiating border positions in which it starts to create      |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=685.54)  | some cool funky shapes.                                                                          |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=687.32)  | And so I don't think we traditionally think of this as a shorthand, because it's only            |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=691.12)  | two values that you need to set for the top left or the top right or bottom right.               |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=695.64)  | But it is interesting.                                                                           |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=696.92)  | I actually didn't know this.                                                                     |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=698.16)  | I didn't realize that you could have these different percentage values.                          |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=701.96)  | And then if you do use the border radius property itself, you can write border radius.           |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=706.82)  | This is an example from the spec.                                                                |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=708.3)   | Border radius 2m 1m 4m slash 0.5m 3m.                                                            |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=714.0)   | And this slash denotes that secondary value.                                                     |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=716.44)  | And that secondary value repeats.                                                                |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=718.44)  | So top left, bottom right.                                                                       |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=720.3)   | So top is 0.5, left is 3, bottom 0.5, right is 3.                                                |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=724.84)  | So this is equivalent to border top left radius 2m 0.5m, border top right radius 1m 3m, and      |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=731.92)  | border bottom right radius 4m 0.5m, and border bottom left radius 1m 3m.                         |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=739.4)   | So you can get really crazy with the border radius here if you wanted to.                        |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=745.6)   | But something that you're probably going to see more commonly is things like 50% for             |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=749.36)  | a circle or an oval, depending on the size of the content itself.                                |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=754.08)  | This will bring those edges in.                                                                  |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=755.8)   | If it's a square, it'll become a circle for border radius 50%.                                   |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=759.48)  | But remember that border radius does reduce the interactive area of an element.                  |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=764.38)  | It will clip your element.                                                                       |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=766.48)  | So when you are creating a border radius for an element, make sure that you still have           |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=770.76)  | the right touch values if it's something that you're going to be interacting with on mobile.     |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=775.88)  | And just be aware that when you do have a radius, if you apply like a box shadow on              |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=780.44)  | it, it's going to also take the size of that radius.                                             |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=783.2)   | Like it's going to move with the element.                                                        |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=786.28)  | And we're actually going to get into that in our next show.                                      |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=787.92)  | It's kind of fun.                                                                                |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=788.96)  | Nice breakdown.                                                                                  |

| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=791.64)  | Like one of them is I want to have a race to see who can say all of these long hand              |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=797.08)  | names the fastest.                                                                               |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=798.16)  | Like I want to border start, start radius, border start, end radius, border start, end           |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=802.8)   | radius.                                                                                          |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=803.8)   | I think that start, start is easier than top left.                                               |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=809.08)  | Actually top left is easier because start, start is like the same word.                          |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=811.96)  | It's like Sally sells seashells by the start, start radius.                                      |

| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=818.28)  | It's like, yeah, it's border top left, left side 30%.                                            |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=820.8)   | It's awesome.                                                                                    |

| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=824.08)  | I have to read that.                                                                             |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=825.08)  | I can't just like off the top of my head, top left, top right, bottom left.                      |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=828.72)  | Actually I could map it, but it's very, I hope that as you're listening, you can understand      |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=833.0)   | what we're saying.                                                                               |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=836.12)  | Another thing that I loved about this conversation.                                              |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=838.44)  | So yeah, the fact that it takes two values is there's this really rad tool.                      |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=842.0)   | It's on nine elements.github.io.                                                                 |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=843.84)  | It's called fancy border radius.                                                                 |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=845.0)   | And it was the first time I heard about it, but they show you how you can make all these         |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=847.72)  | weird blobs with CSS and it's really neat.                                                       |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=851.32)  | They give you this tool to do it.                                                                |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=852.48)  | So we'll have a link in the show notes to create really interesting blobs with border            |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=856.14)  | radius.                                                                                          |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=857.36)  | I think it will blow your mind a little bit.                                                     |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=859.36)  | And then the last one is I had this bite me the other day for the first time ever, which         |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=863.8)   | was 50% for a circle.                                                                            |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=865.88)  | I've been using 50% for my circles since the last time.                                          |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=869.2)   | I used to test people when they would come in and be like, how do you make a circle in           |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=871.8)   | CSS?                                                                                             |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=872.8)   | Cause there's a lot of ways to do it.                                                            |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=874.08)  | And turns out 50% for a circle is not bulletproof.                                               |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=877.48)  | Do you use 100% instead?                                                                         |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=878.88)  | No, it was, you have to use a pixel value.                                                       |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=881.12)  | You have to use something absolute.                                                              |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=883.6)   | And I can't remember the reason.                                                                 |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=884.72)  | Tab Atkins of course had a phenomenal answer and blew my mind, but essentially I ended           |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=889.36)  | up using like a thousand pixels.                                                                 |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=891.2)   | Oh, interesting.                                                                                 |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=892.2)   | And by using a thousand pixels, I was able to reach and made a circle instead of an oval.        |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=896.9)   | So basically that's the tip.                                                                     |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=898.1)   | If you're using 50% and you're getting an oval and know what you wanted was a circle,            |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=902.08)  | try using a really big pixel value.                                                              |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=905.12)  | Might just work.                                                                                 |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=906.12)  | Sometimes where I would run into this is if you had say like a chip and you want those           |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=910.68)  | chips to have a really rounded border radius, 50% there probably is not going to work for        |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=916.14)  | what you're looking for because the rectangular size of your element.                            |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=920.12)  | Exactly.                                                                                         |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=921.12)  | So in that case, you usually have to have an absolute pixel value that's greater than            |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=925.12)  | the 50% would be for that angle to be rounded.                                                   |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=928.7)   | And that's where you get like the really like fun, like round buttons and round chips in         |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=933.44)  | those cases.                                                                                     |

| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=961.04)  | Okay.                                                                                            |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=962.04)  | So we're going to do logical properties with borders.                                            |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=964.72)  | So we kind of talked about some of the shorthands, but just to recap, we have border block start |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=969.12)  | and border block and border inline start border inline.                                          |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=972.32)  | So a lot of the logical properties that we covered in the last episode, well here, that          |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=975.32)  | will work with all this stuff.                                                                   |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=976.32)  | And did we look to see if border radius has logical properties?                                  |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=978.92)  | I think it does.                                                                                 |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=979.92)  | Right.                                                                                           |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=980.92)  | So, oh, and you even covered it.                                                                 |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=981.92)  | So logical properties, think about those when you're writing this stuff.                         |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=983.88)  | I think you'll find you reach more users and you write less styles.                              |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=988.08)  | So super rad.                                                                                    |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=989.36)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=990.36)  | Ultimately.                                                                                      |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=991.36)  | So let's talk about images though, which are where you can get real fancy.                       |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=993.92)  | You want to tell us about border images?                                                         |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=995.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=996.48)  | I feel like this is a territory that is relatively underutilized on the web because you could    |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1000.92) | do a lot of cool things with borders when you incorporate other types of media like              |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1005.56) | SVGs or JPEGs or even animated GIFs.                                                             |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1008.24) | When I was like prepping for the show, I was like, can we use animated GIFs?                     |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1012.2)  | You know that GIF with the CSS and how like you're trying to like open and close the shade.      |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1016.44) | Yup.                                                                                             |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1017.44) | So I put that as a border and it works totally fine.                                             |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1019.2)  | Just give it a really thick width and you can see it around any of your text.                    |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1023.36) | So yeah, there's a ton of also properties for border images and how you make that image          |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1027.52) | fit.                                                                                             |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1028.52) | So Adam, do you want to talk about how we can make our images look the way we want them          |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1031.6)  | to as well?                                                                                      |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1032.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1033.6)  | And maybe this is just Adam's aside stupid episode because all I can think about is you          |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1037.2)  | said animated GIFs is a border and I thought of Rockband and they have that really cool          |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1041.16) | like ornate border that just sort of like is in a slow motion.                                   |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1045.28) | I want to do that on the web now because it is this really cool effect.                          |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1049.12) | Rockband.                                                                                        |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1050.12) | Fansite right there.                                                                             |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1051.12) | Right?                                                                                           |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1052.12) | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1053.12) | Fan.                                                                                             |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1054.12) | Okay.                                                                                            |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1055.12) | So yeah, border images, they take this property called slice and slicing in border images,       |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1056.32) | this is back when we had tools like fireworks and flash where we do this thing called nine       |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1061.8)  | slice scaling where you would take a rectangle and you'd put two lines in it.                    |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1066.56) | So to divide it into three columns and you'd put another two lines going horizontally to         |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1070.4)  | do two rows or three rows and you essentially have three rows, three columns.                    |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1074.32) | The center would be your image, like your content, and then the eight boxes around would         |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1079.14) | be where you would put your border image.                                                        |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1081.44) | And so you'd have a border image in the top left corner that was stationary and looked           |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1085.12) | nice and the top right and bottom left and bottom right, you'd have these kind of cool           |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1088.24) | corner pieces and then you'd have these border images in between those and those slices in       |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1093.04) | between your corners that could scale and repeat so they could sort of grow and shrink.          |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1097.64) | They were responsive and they could fit any viewport and have this really ornate frame           |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1102.28) | around an image.                                                                                 |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1103.28) | It was really cool.                                                                              |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1104.28) | It was called nine slice scaling and you can do that with CSS on the web.                        |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1107.4)  | It's essentially articulating regions that you want to fill with an image and it's great         |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1111.32) | for like we said ornate borders and things like that.                                            |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1114.4)  | And the property accepts up to four positive unit list numbers.                                  |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1118.18) | So if you put them in unit list, they become pixels and you can also specify a percentage        |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1122.24) | in that space and these go into the top right bottom left and then there's an optional fill      |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1126.1)  | keyword for slicing.                                                                             |
| [18:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1127.8)  | This works just like margin where you can put single values that will auto repeat, you           |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1131.36) | know, just like a lot of the other ones here and its initial value is 100%.                      |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1136.0)  | So that's nine slice scaling.                                                                    |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1137.44) | I call it nine slice scaling but this is border image slicing and how it works.                  |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1141.08) | Hope I broke that down good.                                                                     |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1142.44) | That's a great explanation.                                                                      |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1143.44) | I actually did not know the history of that and have you slice so it's really nice to            |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1147.6)  | understand why it works the way it does to be able to use it with that mindset.                  |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1152.94) | So next we have width.                                                                           |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1154.64) | We have border image width and that takes four values so you could set a top right bottom        |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1158.96) | and left values independently of each other.                                                     |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1161.46) | This is similar to border width and sort of the thing I think of here is like why would          |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1165.48) | I want my border width to be different values.                                                   |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1168.46) | You can make like a cool Polaroid border where you have the top left and right border be         |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1174.68) | the same values a little bit thinner and you have like a image as your content and then          |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1178.64) | the border bottom would be thicker.                                                              |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1180.3)  | So if you're using a border image here, your border image source could be like a textured        |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1185.2)  | paper and you would have the same thing where you have the different sizing applied to the       |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1190.48) | different borders that surrounding the content and then you could you know expand and really     |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1196.7)  | be creative and artistic on the web or something.                                                |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1199.04) | I don't know.                                                                                    |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1200.04) | So this is auto.                                                                                 |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1201.8)  | The value for the border image width is auto if it's not set and then the border image           |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1207.56) | width is intrinsic to the width or height of the corresponding image slice.                      |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1212.54) | So that's what happens if you don't set it but if you do set it you could have full control.     |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1217.2)  | Awesome.                                                                                         |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1218.2)  | Yeah you can repeat, scale it, squish it into that space or have it be intrinsic.                |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1221.64) | It's a very very powerful flexible thing that you're right we don't use it enough.               |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1226.56) | It's almost like we've become more obsessed with flat design and so we don't do a lot            |
| [20:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1229.6)  | of these cool unique corner shadows and stuff that we used to do.                                |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1233.36) | Yeah and the border width also changes what your slices look like and what the image actually    |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1238.6)  | looks like in that space depending on what kind of border you have it'll stretch it or           |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1242.72) | shrink it and we're going to talk about how that corresponds even more a little bit as           |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1247.18) | we continue this conversation.                                                                   |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1248.84) | Awesome.                                                                                         |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1249.84) | We also have border image outset has a kind of nickname called edge overhang and it's            |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1254.8)  | basically how much should the image area extend beyond the border box.                           |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1258.72) | So we talked about the border box earlier as being something that takes up geometric             |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1262.42) | space but this outset property allows you to paint beyond that geometric space.                  |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1268.36) | So it reminds me a lot of spread for box shadow.                                                 |
| [21:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1271.44) | It takes positive unitless values.                                                               |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1272.96) | That's a good comparison.                                                                        |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1274.44) | Yeah put it in your back pocket.                                                                 |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1275.6)  | I think this outset thing could be really nice if you want to extend to your border              |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1279.24) | image beyond the space that is being consumed.                                                   |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1281.96) | I'm sure that'd be handy for somebody somewhere.                                                 |
| [21:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1284.76) | Yeah I like that analogy that you made with spread and box shadow.                               |
| [21:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1287.04) | I think that's really relevant.                                                                  |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1289.2)  | So also when you're working with border images you have this border image repeat and this        |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1294.16) | sets how the border image will appear and it really does some heavy lifting here.                |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1299.42) | So you could set the border image repeat to stretch and this will stretch the image to           |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1304.44) | fill the area.                                                                                   |
| [21:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1305.44) | So this would be useful if you were using a textured border like in the example that             |
| [21:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1309.16) | I gave above or if you're doing like a marble border or something like that.                     |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1312.36) | I've done that before.                                                                           |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1313.36) | I thought it looked cute.                                                                        |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1315.1)  | There's also border image repeat and in this use case the image is tiled or repeated to          |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1321.36) | fill the area so you could have like a mosaic of shapes and repeat that throughout the border.   |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1326.24) | So I'm thinking like a Portuguese tiled architecture or something like that.                     |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1330.8)  | There is border image repeat round and this is similar to the repeat value but it's a            |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1334.76) | little bit smarter because with round if the image doesn't fill the area with a whole            |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1339.04) | number of tiles then the image is rescaled to fit into that area.                                |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1343.98) | And finally we have border image repeat space.                                                   |
| [22:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1346.92) | This is also similar to repeat and round but here when the image is tiled if it doesn't          |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1351.96) | fill the area with the full number of tiles then the tiles are spread out with space between     |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1357.56) | them so you can kind of think of this like flex boxes spaced evenly but with the tiled           |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1363.32) | images in the border of your element.                                                            |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1366.52) | Very cool.                                                                                       |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1367.52) | Lots of options for getting unique and great wrapping of your border images.                     |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1371.88) | There's a CSS tricks post too that they cover a lot of this and they have a nice demo where      |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1375.52) | you can click these different radio buttons and see how these different repeats apply            |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1378.48) | and I think that's really nice to just get that tangible vibe there.                             |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1382.32) | Nice recap.                                                                                      |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1383.44) | The last part we have for border images is shorthands and there's only one.                      |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1387.04) | It's border-image and when you pass value in here you need to pass in this order source,         |
| [23:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1393.32) | slice, width, outset, and repeat.                                                                |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1396.8)  | And if you're missing any of those values they're set to the initial value.                      |
| [23:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1400.0)  | And that's it for the shorthands for border image.                                               |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1401.92) | Nice.                                                                                            |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1402.92) | I feel like we covered all of borders in a pretty effective time span.                           |
| [23:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1408.0)  | Borders in CSS are super fun and a great way to add your own personal aesthetic to your          |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1411.96) | site.                                                                                            |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1412.96) | I've done borders with dog paws and that marble texture that I was talking about before          |
| [23:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1416.36) | to just spice up some content boxes and you can even create borders with shadows so that's       |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1420.84) | exactly what we'll be talking about our next episode so stay tuned.                              |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1424.52) | Yeah, I loved this one.                                                                          |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1425.6)  | I did a lot of borders with grunge back in the day.                                              |
| [23:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1428.8)  | Oh nice.                                                                                         |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1429.8)  | Yes, the grunge textured layout.                                                                 |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XyDsL1T9k5vBvwyjfr7JH?&t=1432.4)  | That would be great for that outset so I could just like make all this like splatter go way      |
