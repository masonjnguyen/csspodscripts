| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=16.84)   | Today's episode is about layout.                                                                    |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=19.28)   | And in this episode, we're talking about layout on the web and all the different ways that          |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=22.36)   | you can implement layouts in CSS.                                                                   |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=24.58)   | It's almost historically linear, but not strictly.                                                  |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=28.2)    | And with CSS, we can design print layouts that vary with media queries.                             |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=31.52)   | We can use floats or flexbox or grid.                                                               |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=33.32)   | We can be liquid or adaptive.                                                                       |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=35.42)   | It's rad.                                                                                           |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=36.5)    | You can even use CSS Houdini with the upcoming layout API to create your own layouts.               |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=42.26)   | Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks, right?                                              |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=44.44)   | I'll watch me use Houdini to teach that browser a new trick.                                        |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=47.52)   | So we're going to breeze through all of these different strategies without diving too deeply        |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=51.62)   | into any particular syntax.                                                                         |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=53.44)   | But don't worry, there will be upcoming shows where we'll cover all the things about flexbox        |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=57.6)    | and grid.                                                                                           |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=58.6)    | And more.                                                                                           |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=59.6)    | Some of the earliest web development I remember was using predefined templates in a program         |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=63.96)   | like Dreamweaver.                                                                                   |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=64.96)   | Oh yeah.                                                                                            |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=65.96)   | And there was like this main content area, which was either fixed or fluid width.                   |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=69.32)   | And you had these optional left or right sidebars, as well as a header or footer that was optional. |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=74.42)   | So some form of these three panel layout combinations was essentially every layout on the web.      |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=79.6)    | Oh, for real.                                                                                       |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=80.6)    | Hey, do you remember the Holy Grail layout?                                                         |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=82.32)   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=83.32)   | I remember a lot of articles about Holy Grail layout and grid, like the Holy Grail grid             |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=87.28)   | too that was always like a 12 column.                                                               |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=88.88)   | Anyway, that came after Holy Grail layout, but there's just some web history there.                 |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=92.52)   | So a little bit of web history.                                                                     |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=93.52)   | Well, should we start from the beginning?                                                           |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=95.16)   | Let's start from the beginning.                                                                     |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=96.16)   | All right.                                                                                          |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=97.16)   | Well, I remember at least the earliest amount of layout that you had was just a block.              |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=101.52)  | And we talk about blocks sometimes, but that's what we mean is that the earliest layout style       |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=105.28)  | was a block and everything was a block.                                                             |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=107.06)  | And you were either in flow or a flow root.                                                         |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=110.52)  | So you're either a member in a flowing set of blocks or you are a block container that              |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=115.32)  | had a bunch of children that needed to flow there.                                                  |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=117.56)  | So I thought that was just kind of interesting that when we talk about flow, we're kind of          |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=121.12)  | talking about the child elements that are inside of a flow root and the direction and               |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=124.76)  | the position and the things that they need to do inside of there.                                   |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=127.52)  | Whereas like a flow root, the element generates a block container box and lays out its contents     |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=131.96)  | using flow layout and always establishes a new block formatting context for its content.            |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=136.68)  | So new block formatting context, these are like primitives in CSS with layout and we'll             |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=141.6)   | talk more about those later.                                                                        |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=143.28)  | But back in the early kind of times here, there was really no creative layouts.                     |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=147.04)  | Any creative layout that somebody did was pretty much a hack and it had absolutely positioned       |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=150.76)  | items or it had hit areas that were positioned over an image.                                       |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=153.98)  | I just remember like you download a website.                                                        |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=155.84)  | Oh, image maps.                                                                                     |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=156.84)  | Yeah, it's just one big image with some like hot areas that you could click on.                     |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=160.04)  | It's super funny.                                                                                   |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=161.04)  | Yeah, that was actually like most websites too.                                                     |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=163.04)  | It was.                                                                                             |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=164.04)  | I mean, it was like a great way to have a consistent experience, but it's just kind of, I don't     |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=167.2)   | know, didn't scale well.                                                                            |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=168.2)   | I remember I had all these problems.                                                                |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=169.92)  | But what was cool too about this early layout stuff is it could already work on paper.              |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=174.16)  | So it was printable and shareable, you know, like paperback.                                        |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=176.84)  | If you had a document, it was really hard to send to someone that was really far away.              |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=180.5)   | And with the web, it was responsive out of the box.                                                 |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=182.92)  | Well, it's kind of liquid out of the box, but not adaptive, right?                                  |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=185.76)  | Your blocks would adjust with the screen width and they would reflow as they got smaller,           |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=190.26)  | but you couldn't adapt.                                                                             |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=191.26)  | There was no media queries, but it was so cool that like the content that you visited               |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=194.8)   | on your 56k modem, like you could see it on your screen and your neighbor's screen.                 |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=199.2)   | You could even transfer it to paper.                                                                |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=201.08)  | You could go onto the web, download this thing over this weird wire onto your computer and          |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=205.16)  | then print it.                                                                                      |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=206.16)  | It was really cool.                                                                                 |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=207.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=208.16)  | And that was just sort of like first layout stuff.                                                  |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=210.02)  | And that talks a lot to the history of the web where it was a document sharing mechanism            |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=214.8)   | where you were sharing docs from one person to another, from universities, between universities.    |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=219.64)  | And so that is no surprise when we talked about sizing units in the last episode.                   |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=224.68)  | A lot of those are really inspired by print typography as well.                                     |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=227.24)  | And some of the earliest CSS1 unit types came from typography.                                      |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=230.8)   | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=231.8)   | We're seeing some themes here and you were mentioning the header footer sidebar stuff.              |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=235.6)   | And that reminded me of my first kind of layout that I remember doing that wasn't just using        |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=240.8)   | margin.                                                                                             |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=241.8)   | It was with frame sets.                                                                             |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=243.28)  | And if you don't know what a frame set is, everyone, I'm going to help you break it down.           |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=245.86)  | This is pretty much deprecated at this point, but imagine CSS grid and iframes had a baby           |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=251.04)  | right now.                                                                                          |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=252.04)  | Yeah, that's frame sets.                                                                            |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=253.4)   | So it's like, OK, you could make a grid where there was a header and a sidebar and a footer         |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=257.58)  | and a main content area.                                                                            |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=258.9)   | And essentially each of those would be their own HTML files.                                        |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=262.16)  | So if we're thinking about how we're bummed out these days that there's no consistent               |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=265.52)  | partial concept or like an HTML import idea or that's pretty much why we go single page             |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=269.88)  | applications is just so we can click links and not have to redraw the nav bar and the               |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=273.36)  | header and the sidebar and stuff.                                                                   |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=274.76)  | You could do that with frame sets.                                                                  |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=276.32)  | You basically could have like you define these grid areas and they were defined on an attribute     |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=280.64)  | of the frame set element as columns equal 25 percent comma star comma 25 percent.                   |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=286.48)  | And that's almost like a grid template area being 25 percent space one f r comma 25 percent.        |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=293.04)  | And then you could also do rows.                                                                    |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=294.04)  | So you could do rows and columns with these frame sets and then populate each frame with            |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=297.56)  | an HTML file.                                                                                       |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=298.96)  | You could listen for clicks and set a new frame to be a new source and all sorts of                 |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=302.52)  | interesting stuff.                                                                                  |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=303.6)   | They were really weird because they could also have their own little scroll space.                  |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=306.72)  | So you'd be like in the sidebar scrolling the sidebar.                                              |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=309.36)  | I don't know they were a little uncanny but they're interesting.                                    |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=311.48)  | You could do some layouts back then with those.                                                     |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=313.2)   | And then tables were used for a lot of layout.                                                      |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=315.64)  | You could adjust the layout with cell padding and cell spacing and you even had alignment           |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=320.28)  | features like centering left and right alignment within tables.                                     |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=324.0)   | And these were also liquid like you mentioned earlier but not adaptive.                             |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=327.46)  | So it could adjust to the width of that page but you can't reflow the layout based on its           |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=333.56)  | viewport size or other content in its viewport.                                                     |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=336.88)  | And the way that I think of this is like trying to style things in like an Excel or like a          |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=341.0)   | Google Sheets sheet.                                                                                |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=342.94)  | You can do a lot of styling like you can change background colors and you can change where          |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=347.12)  | the cell collapses and expands and some placement of the content inside of it.                      |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=353.48)  | But this is really hard to work with based on how much flexibility that we have today.              |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=357.92)  | So then you have CSS display table and this lets you drop all of this semantic table markup         |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=363.04)  | which people were abusing hacking for layouts.                                                      |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=365.52)  | A lot of this came from hacks and instead use divs for something that's more semantic               |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=370.4)   | to the layout purpose but still lets you use the table layout mechanisms like centering             |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=376.72)  | and like the way that you were adjusting size but with elements that make more sense to             |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=381.68)  | the semantic content inside of those.                                                               |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=383.68)  | So you could have margins, padding, the collapsing of those margins.                                |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=387.54)  | You could sort of do responsiveness with table layout where you have things that are kind           |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=392.88)  | of scrolling out of view.                                                                           |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=394.62)  | So this is something that you can still use today.                                                  |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=397.54)  | You probably don't need to with some of the more new layout mechanisms but yeah, you can            |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=402.4)   | style layouts, tables, we're such a big part of doing that on the web.                              |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=407.46)  | There's also floats.                                                                                |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=408.78)  | When you think of floats, this is something that I've used a lot in the web, you can think          |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=412.0)   | of it like a news article.                                                                          |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=414.0)   | So if you have a media page, if you have a news article that's laid out, you have an                |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=417.84)  | image and you often see text that's flowing around the article and that's what floats               |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=422.36)  | do.                                                                                                 |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=423.36)  | So you can sort of align to a side that you're floating at left or right and then let the           |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=428.2)   | inline elements around it flow around that element in the page.                                     |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=432.06)  | So I like to think of floats as like adding a magnet to an element.                                 |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=435.1)   | It'll pull that element to the directions floating.                                                 |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=437.62)  | If there's another floated element already all the way on that side, it'll line next                |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=441.6)   | to it.                                                                                              |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=442.6)   | So if you stack floats, you'll be stacking them next to each other.                                 |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=445.54)  | You can sort of think of this as balloons too.                                                      |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=447.2)   | If there's a balloon already on the ceiling and you float another balloon up there, it'll           |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=450.88)  | land under the original balloon.                                                                    |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=452.6)   | Ooh, nice visual.                                                                                   |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=453.6)   | That was awesome.                                                                                   |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=454.6)   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=455.6)   | So that's like a way to think about it and everything else all the air around that will             |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=457.76)  | float around the balloon.                                                                           |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=459.12)  | But before we had these newer mechanisms for layout, people would use floats for everything.        |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=463.0)   | And then you had to clear fix elements where you would create these like cleared float              |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=468.2)   | elements for segments to start over again.                                                          |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=471.04)  | And that is like a time I don't miss, but it existed.                                               |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=474.64)  | And I think floats are still valid for media that's floating around text.                           |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=478.12)  | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=479.12)  | And the original purpose that they were made for is very valid and even more prominent              |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=483.48)  | and usable now than it's ever been.                                                                 |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=485.28)  | It's kind of funny how like whole layouts were built on this like bootstrap built a                 |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=488.72)  | 12 column grid out of floats.                                                                       |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=490.84)  | It's kind of amazing.                                                                               |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=491.84)  | Yeah, yeah, that's right.                                                                           |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=493.12)  | So we also have positioning.                                                                        |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=494.82)  | So this is a layout mechanism in CSS, right?                                                        |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=496.96)  | You have static, relative, fixed, absolute and sticky positioning now.                              |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=500.8)   | And positioning allows you to sort of move an element while it's either still containing            |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=505.08)  | its space or pop it out of the space.                                                               |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=507.04)  | So let's talk about static.                                                                         |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=508.66)  | Static is what every element has by default, and it makes the element stick to the normal           |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=512.24)  | page flow, but it ignores left to top right bottom values that might be set.                        |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=517.06)  | So if you're wondering why your values of left top right bottom are not being set, it's             |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=520.24)  | because your position is static and it's intended to ignore those.                                  |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=523.42)  | But as soon as you set it to relative, so position relative, it's similar to static                 |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=527.08)  | and that it's still within normal page flow.                                                        |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=529.2)   | But this time the top right left bottom values do work.                                             |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=532.72)  | Also the original block area consumed by the element is maintained even after you change            |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=537.32)  | its position.                                                                                       |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=538.32)  | So this can be really cool and tricky.                                                              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=539.8)   | It also creates a stacking context, which I'm sure we'll break down in another episode              |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=543.68)  | at some point because it deserves its own breakdown.                                                |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=546.1)   | There's also fixed and absolute positioning.                                                        |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=548.2)   | So fixed positioning positions the element relative to the viewport.                                |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=553.02)  | So if you scroll that element will stay in the same place, it remains in that spot.                 |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=557.38)  | The element is removed from both the block and inline flow of the page and essentially              |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=561.76)  | lives in a new context on the page itself.                                                          |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=564.66)  | So absolute positioning, like fixed positioning, removes the element from its initial block         |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=569.4)   | flow.                                                                                               |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=570.4)   | But unlike fixed positioning, it will be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor,    |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=575.24)  | the nearest parent that has a positioning.                                                          |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=577.78)  | So if there are no elements with positioning on the page, an absolute element will be positioned    |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=582.28)  | to the document body itself.                                                                        |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=584.08)  | So that's why if you have like position absolute on an element without any other positioning,       |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=587.96)  | it kind of goes all the way to the top left of the page by default.                                 |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=591.38)  | But if you have a parent with a positioning, so like if you have an element with a position         |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=595.82)  | relative and then you have a child with position absolute, then it will be positioned based         |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=600.9)   | on that parent element.                                                                             |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=602.2)   | It will be positioned within that element's flow on the page.                                       |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=605.96)  | So this technique is super common.                                                                  |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=607.88)  | The positioning a parent element with relative positioning and then positioning its children        |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=612.52)  | with absolute positioning.                                                                          |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=614.12)  | That happens a lot with pseudo elements, for example, and it's a pattern that we see pretty         |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=618.16)  | frequently.                                                                                         |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=619.16)  | Absolutely, positioned items are great for stacking things and making decorative elements           |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=623.4)   | that maybe don't need to be in flow, but do need to be associated with the content.                 |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=627.04)  | Yeah, totally.                                                                                      |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=628.04)  | And our last positioning item here is sticky, which is one of my favorites.                         |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=632.12)  | And it maintains a block level layout when it's not stuck.                                          |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=635.0)   | But when it reaches a certain viewport edge, depending on how you've told it, it will stick         |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=639.46)  | based on the side of the viewport that you told it to.                                              |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=642.52)  | And even cooler, once it's stuck, its block is not collapsed.                                       |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=646.0)   | It's maintained in case it comes back to return.                                                    |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=648.44)  | So this allows the element to return to its previous position in flow without any layout            |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=652.6)   | recalculation.                                                                                      |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=653.6)   | It's handy, it's neat, it's efficient, scroll and viewport, contextually aware positioning.         |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=658.92)  | So rad.                                                                                             |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=659.92)  | Yeah, so for Chrome Dev Summit last year, Adam and I did a talk about some cool CSS                 |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=664.68)  | tricks.                                                                                             |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=665.68)  | And he had some great sticky positioning demos in there.                                            |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=669.04)  | So we'll link to that in the show notes.                                                            |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=670.44)  | So you can check out his demos.                                                                     |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=672.12)  | He has like four or five different ways to use sticky positioning with lists, and they're           |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=676.68)  | awesome.                                                                                            |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=677.68)  | So check this out.                                                                                  |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=678.68)  | Thanks.                                                                                             |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=679.68)  | You can also style things by using a display.                                                       |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=682.56)  | So that display could be inline or a block or inline block.                                         |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=685.6)   | And I kind of want to talk about the differences between these.                                     |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=688.24)  | So let's start with display inline.                                                                 |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=690.0)   | If you write display inline, the element stays in the same line and only takes up the width         |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=694.62)  | of its content.                                                                                     |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=696.12)  | So inline elements appear next to each other on the same line.                                      |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=699.72)  | When you have a paragraph, for example, you might have a span within it or a link within            |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=704.24)  | it.                                                                                                 |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=705.24)  | That will have an inline display.                                                                   |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=706.94)  | If you set a width and height on an inline element, those values are just going to be               |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=711.88)  | ignored.                                                                                            |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=712.88)  | You can't set a width and height on it because it's taking the width of its content and the         |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=716.68)  | height of that inline block, the inline axis.                                                       |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=720.72)  | So just remember that even if you declare width and height after you set something as               |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=724.84)  | display inline, it's going to ignore those.                                                         |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=727.28)  | And so as I mentioned briefly, these elements flow on the inline axis.                              |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=731.2)   | And this inline axis actually changes with writing modes.                                           |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=734.48)  | We don't have a ton of time to dive into that in this show, but remember that different             |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=738.08)  | languages and different writing modes will change the inline and block directions of                |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=742.08)  | the page.                                                                                           |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=743.08)  | For example, languages with a horizontal writing mode like English have an inline axis that's       |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=748.44)  | horizontal.                                                                                         |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=749.44)  | The inline flow goes horizontally from right to left.                                               |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=752.0)   | In a vertical writing mode like some Japanese typefaces, that inline axis is vertical.              |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=756.76)  | And you can use logical properties for styling that's more aware of these adjustments, more         |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=761.1)   | context and internationalized in your designs.                                                      |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=764.76)  | And I'm definitely looking forward to having a show about those in the future.                      |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=767.64)  | Me too.                                                                                             |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=768.64)  | When you talk about inline, there's also a concept of inline size in CSS.                           |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=772.0)   | And this can be thought of as logical width for those logical properties.                           |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=775.6)   | There's also display block.                                                                         |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=777.44)  | When you apply display block to an element, the element starts in a new line.                       |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=781.36)  | This takes up the largest possible width and is responsive to width and height properties.          |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=785.88)  | So you can set width and height on block elements.                                                  |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=789.2)   | Block size, like inline size, is logical height instead of logical width.                           |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=793.18)  | And the block axis refers to the block flow of a page.                                              |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=796.66)  | So in a horizontal writing mode, again like English, block flow on a page is vertical               |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=800.64)  | from top to bottom.                                                                                 |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=802.24)  | Since we read left to right, top to bottom, that's where the content flows in the page.             |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=806.04)  | And in a vertical writing mode, this is horizontal since the text would flow from the top to        |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=810.44)  | bottom and the layout would flow from the left to the right.                                        |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=813.14)  | The block layout is going to be horizontal left to right.                                           |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=816.4)   | You might be wondering, okay, great.                                                                |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=817.8)   | I get inline.                                                                                       |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=818.8)   | I get block.                                                                                        |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=819.8)   | What about inline block?                                                                            |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=820.8)   | What happens when we combine those?                                                                 |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=822.68)  | Inline block is a combination of both inline and block level features, as the name indicates.       |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=827.76)  | This key here is that inline block always stays within the inline axis of the document,             |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=833.1)   | but it also responds to width and height properties.                                                |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=835.72)  | So a popular use case here is items that you want inline, but something that you want to            |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=840.48)  | set their size to.                                                                                  |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=841.92)  | So this could be like items within a navigation bar.                                                |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=844.44)  | You can also do this with flexbox, but these display types of block, inline and inline              |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=849.18)  | block came way before flexbox.                                                                      |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=850.8)   | So these patterns became pretty entrenched.                                                         |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=853.64)  | Excellent breakdown of the different block types.                                                   |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=855.4)   | Loved it.                                                                                           |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=856.4)   | So at this point we have like absolute positioning.                                                 |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=858.24)  | We have blocks, we have inline blocks, we have floats, and all of a sudden we get media             |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=863.92)  | queries and our responsive layouts go from only being liquid to now being adaptive.                 |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=870.08)  | And we earned a whole bunch of other kind of cool superpowers, right?                               |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=872.16)  | I always just love talking about liquid and adaptive, it sounds so cool.                            |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=875.28)  | It does, yeah.                                                                                      |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=876.6)   | It is what it is, right?                                                                            |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=877.96)  | So at this point the CSS Zen garden came out, which kind of blew a bunch of minds because           |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=882.68)  | essentially the markup wouldn't change or the JavaScript wouldn't change, but you could             |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=886.88)  | make thousands and thousands of different layouts.                                                  |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=889.84)  | And that's what people did.                                                                         |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=890.84)  | They explored the power, the superpower of CSS to be able to accomplish this.                       |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=895.54)  | And this is still a superpower CSS has, just most teams don't lean into it right now, which         |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=899.88)  | is fine.                                                                                            |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=900.96)  | And I just had an idea though, which is, okay, so you know how like popular TodoMVC is?             |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=905.56)  | What if we made Zen TodoGarden where it's like how many delightful layouts could the                |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=909.9)   | design community do TodoMVC with just CSS?                                                          |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=912.96)  | So all the JavaScript, all the framework code stays the same, but you just change styles.           |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=917.44)  | How many different Todo apps could you make that way?                                               |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=920.0)   | It could be kind of cool.                                                                           |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=921.0)   | Well, the problem is styling the checkbox would become a pain.                                      |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=924.56)  | Yeah, a classic issue.                                                                              |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=926.74)  | And then at this time we also had like 12 column grids or maybe it was eight or 12 or               |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=930.56)  | 16 or whatever your team decided on was the right thing.                                            |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=933.28)  | But 12 column was the one that Bootstrap made famous.                                               |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=935.68)  | And then we also had debates at this time about where the logic should go for your layouts.         |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=939.12)  | Should it be classes on your markup or should it be in your selectors?                              |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=941.8)   | So you had like Suzy versus Bootstrap was kind of a popular one there.                              |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=945.56)  | Yeah, there are a lot of different grids.                                                           |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=946.56)  | Yeah, there were tons.                                                                              |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=947.56)  | It was kind of fun to try them all because they all had little different superpowers.               |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=950.64)  | And anyway, yeah, the web churned on grids at this time.                                            |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=953.28)  | There was just so many.                                                                             |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=954.28)  | So trying to decide which one was better was really hard, but it was kind of cool though.           |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=957.88)  | We're pulling off really, really cool layouts at this point.                                        |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=961.24)  | Flexbox is a big game changer for layout after this.                                                |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=963.44)  | So first of all, the struggle of getting an element both vertically and horizontally centered       |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=968.64)  | has been and still is the center of so many CSS jokes.                                              |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=972.66)  | But Flexbox makes it easy with three lines of code.                                                 |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=975.32)  | You too can center those elements.                                                                  |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=977.88)  | Flexbox gives a container the ability to alter the height with and also the order of its            |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=982.28)  | children to best fit the available space.                                                           |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=985.0)   | That makes responsive design a lot easier.                                                          |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=987.8)   | Items expand or shrink till they fit the available space or to prevent overflow.                    |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=993.48)  | So Flexbox layouts, they allow for directional agnostic styling.                                    |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=997.96)  | And this happened for the first time, which was really exciting.                                    |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1000.62) | Not just block and inline styling.                                                                  |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1002.16) | You can specify a row or column as the flex direction.                                              |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1005.0)  | You could reorganize, you could reorder items.                                                      |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1007.6)  | Flexbox also gives you the ability to justify and align your items based on the space of            |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1011.68) | its parent container or the siblings within that parent container.                                  |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1016.34) | For example, you could center content in that space, but you could also justify the content         |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1020.96) | within the element.                                                                                 |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1022.76) | You could use space between and that meant that the outer elements reached the edges                |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1026.04) | of the box and the elements between those were evenly spaced.                                       |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1029.52) | There's space around so they all get the same kind of spacing.                                      |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1032.2)  | There's just like so many ways that you could justify and align elements.                           |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1036.56) | And you could even make these cool dynamic layouts where you can use the wrap argument              |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1040.48) | with Flexbox to have elements wrap when they don't fit the space.                                   |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1044.08) | You can use Flexbasis.                                                                              |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1045.82) | So if you combine these Flexbox techniques, you can really create responsive layouts with           |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1051.06) | just a few lines of code without having to use media queries.                                       |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1054.6)  | So you get these auto place responsive layouts with Flexbox.                                        |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1058.3)  | It's pretty cool to see this become a possibility.                                                  |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1061.6)  | People could rely less on media queries are specific and more on the content within the             |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1065.92) | parent itself to identify when it should wrap and when it should shrink, when it should             |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1070.24) | expand.                                                                                             |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1071.48) | And so this is all really exciting, but layout got even more exciting with CSS Grid.                |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1075.56) | Oh yeah, Grid is so rad.                                                                            |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1077.08) | And Flexbox, when it came out, I remember thinking, oh, this is like constraint based               |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1081.2)  | layout.                                                                                             |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1082.2)  | This is like what Android and iOS are doing inside of their tools.                                  |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1084.16) | Like this is so cool.                                                                               |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1085.16) | I love this concept of constraining like a container and then letting children and algorithms       |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1089.86) | decide the rest of the layout.                                                                      |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1091.4)  | But we did, we hit a limit to that pretty quickly.                                                  |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1094.14) | I mean, it's as powerful it is and it's still useful, but this is why we came up with Grid.         |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1098.52) | And Grid is sort of like a flatter matrix.                                                          |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1101.9)  | It's a way to get rid of a lot of the wrapper nodes that you might have needed in your classic      |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1105.28) | 12 column bootstrap layouts.                                                                        |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1106.8)  | Anyway, if anyone remembers how many divs it took to sort of make those layouts, it's               |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1110.08) | really annoying.                                                                                    |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1111.08) | But with Grid, we didn't have to do that.                                                           |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1112.88) | We could also define a space in the viewport or in the page and place items.                        |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1119.04) | And this reminds me a lot of when I was making yearbooks in junior high where we would have         |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1122.32) | these different templates and they would have like, here's where the hero can go and here's         |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1126.32) | it.                                                                                                 |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1127.32) | And so we would place items there like very physically.                                             |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1128.92) | And I feel so similar to that, like so many nostalgia berries that I get to eat when I'm            |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1132.92) | using Grid template areas and I'm saying somewhere should go in a certain name to location.         |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1137.24) | It just feels very print centric, very cool, popular, powerful way to lay things out.               |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1142.08) | But one of my favorite things that came with Grid, other than, you know, like really robust         |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1146.24) | ways to make grids, it did is what it does, right, is Gap.                                          |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1150.3)  | And Gap was this new spacing paradigm, is this new ownership.                                       |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1154.02) | And it was the parent.                                                                              |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1155.02) | The parent could dynamically and simply define the space between its children.                      |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1159.48) | It was like so elegant and so subtle and now it's just this thing that we take for granted          |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1164.56) | and can't wait for Flexbox to have across all the browsers so that we can just start                |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1167.72) | gapping and kind of let the container own that space.                                               |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1170.96) | Yes, please.                                                                                        |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1171.96) | Yes, please.                                                                                        |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1172.96) | I want it.                                                                                          |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1173.96) | And now, so we have all that stuff.                                                                 |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1175.0)  | We've been still exploring Grid for a couple of years now.                                          |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1177.28) | The support is amazing, but we're waiting on Subgrid.                                               |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1180.48) | And Subgrid is going to give us a new superpower.                                                   |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1182.6)  | So when you're making a grid, if we even go back to that like print example of like a               |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1185.6)  | yearbook page, those grid lines that we drew at the high level page, any nested child element       |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1191.08) | can opt in to following those grid lines.                                                           |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1193.52) | Well, that doesn't happen with CSS Grid on the web.                                                 |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1195.6)  | If I make a macro layout, so if I lay out my page, my header, my footer, my sidebars,               |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1200.08) | all with Grid, those grid lines can't pass down to any nested children unless they're               |
| [20:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1205.14) | direct descendants of that grid, but not with Subgrid.                                              |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1208.3)  | So with Subgrid, essentially any number of children down into the DOM tree can opt into             |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1213.62) | the grid of a parent and align itself to the lines that were made there.                            |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1217.28) | It's super awesome.                                                                                 |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1218.52) | So Grid also has really strong extrinsic powers, which is where you sort of like define these       |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1222.52) | content areas.                                                                                      |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1223.52) | You can say, I want three columns.                                                                  |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1224.52) | And then you say, here's three pieces of content go into these columns.                             |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1227.28) | So it's like an extrinsic power, but it also comes with some pretty good intrinsic powers.          |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1231.36) | I would say it's much stronger with extrinsic layouts and a little weaker with intrinsic            |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1235.82) | layouts where Flexbox can excel in intrinsic layouts, but doesn't necessarily excel like            |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1241.08) | Grid does in extrinsic ones.                                                                        |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1242.82) | So anyway, I think Grid ultimately is limited by the fact that it makes columns and rows,           |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1247.7)  | but that's also kind of its superpowers.                                                            |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1249.32) | So right here's some trade-offs.                                                                    |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1250.86) | Kind of interesting.                                                                                |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1251.86) | Grid, I'm a big fan.                                                                                |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1252.86) | I can't wait till that episode.                                                                     |
| [20:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1253.86) | That's going to be fun stuff.                                                                       |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1254.86) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1255.86) | The one I think really great intrinsic superpower is the place item center where you could place    |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1259.22) | items with one line of code instead of the three lines of code you need for Flexbox.                |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1262.72) | Oh, Flex can do place items and place content.                                                      |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1265.24) | Oh, I didn't realize that.                                                                          |
| [21:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1266.24) | I thought that was a grid.                                                                          |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1267.24) | I just tweeted that the other day.                                                                  |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1268.68) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [21:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1269.68) | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [21:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1270.68) | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1271.68) | Thing I learned.                                                                                    |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1272.68) | I'm going to go next.                                                                               |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1273.68) | It's like, how do we do better than Grid?                                                           |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1274.68) | Well, we go custom.                                                                                 |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1275.68) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1276.68) | I don't think that we could end a layout show without talking about what's coming down the          |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1279.38) | pipeline and that's CSS Houdini.                                                                    |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1281.58) | Houdini is an umbrella term that describes a series of low-level and high-level APIs                |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1286.38) | that give developers much more control over the CSS they write and how the browser understands      |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1290.84) | that CSS.                                                                                           |
| [21:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1292.1)  | One of the Houdini APIs is called the layout API or the layout worklet.                             |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1296.38) | While we're not going to dive too far into this with the Houdini worklets, you can author           |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1301.14) | and essentially create and specify new layout algorithms for the browser.                           |
| [21:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1307.46) | That's super cool.                                                                                  |
| [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1308.46) | Do you want a random layout?                                                                        |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1309.6)  | You can write one by applying randomization to the block and inline offset of children              |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1314.32) | within a parent layout.                                                                             |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1315.92) | Do you want a circular layout?                                                                      |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1317.8)  | You can also calculate the layout based on the number of children and place them in any             |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1321.7)  | geometric pattern you desire.                                                                       |
| [22:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1323.7)  | In the HTML, you'd write your markup like normal.                                                   |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1325.94) | In the CSS, you just apply the worklet to the parent and his children will automatically            |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1330.62) | fall in line or in circle, whichever you specified.                                                 |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1333.98) | So cool.                                                                                            |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1334.98) | The layout worklet is super cool.                                                                   |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1336.26) | It's super powerful and definitely worth checking out if you're someone who loves tinkering         |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1339.94) | with experimental tech and want to start building your own layouts.                                 |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1343.18) | I love that Houdini.                                                                                |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1344.18) | When are we going to do Houdini episode?                                                            |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1346.34) | I'm excited.                                                                                        |
| [22:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1347.34) | We'll get there.                                                                                    |
| [22:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1348.34) | We'll get there.                                                                                    |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1349.34) | That's going to be a deep one.                                                                      |
| [22:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1350.34) | I like it.                                                                                          |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1351.34) | All right.                                                                                          |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1352.34) | So to recap this whole thing, we wanted to share some like new advancements with the                |
| [22:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1354.34) | display property of CSS and kind of blow your minds and maybe if you didn't know this               |
| [22:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1359.34) | or not, but display block is actually shorthand display inline display flex display grid.           |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1366.1)  | These are shorthands.                                                                               |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1367.5)  | And so what we want to do is we want to go over and expand these into their long hands.             |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1372.02) | So just for CSS fun fact gathering, you know.                                                       |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1374.66) | All right.                                                                                          |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1375.66) | So the first one is display block is actually shorthand for block space flow where the outer        |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1381.96) | display is blocked, but that's children will be in flow, which is what we described at              |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1385.86) | the beginning of this episode.                                                                      |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1387.04) | Which makes sense because it is the block flow of the page.                                         |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1390.32) | And so to add onto that inline would be the inline flow of the page.                                |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1394.34) | Yup.                                                                                                |
| [23:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1395.34) | Inline flow.                                                                                        |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1396.34) | Inline space flow.                                                                                  |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1397.34) | And we also have inline dash block, which is shorthand for inline space flow dash root,             |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1401.46) | right?                                                                                              |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1402.46) | So this is a little tricky, but anyway, it's kind of cool.                                          |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1404.58) | So this is something that's inline to the flow root, which is that parent root doc that             |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1410.42) | we described in the beginning.                                                                      |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1412.14) | Words are confusing.                                                                                |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1413.56) | But then we have table, which is going to be a block table because table layouts take               |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1418.4)  | up a block amount of space in the UI's block axis.                                                  |
| [23:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1421.98) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1422.98) | It's outer is a block member, but it's inner is a table.                                            |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1425.26) | Right.                                                                                              |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1426.26) | And then there's flex, which is an outer is a block.                                                |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1428.06) | Right.                                                                                              |
| [23:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1429.06) | So if you make a flex container, it'll fill the width just like display block does, but             |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1431.86) | then it's inner children are displayed using flex.                                                  |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1434.72) | So akin to that, you have inline flex where you have a flex container where its inside              |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1440.5)  | layout is flex box, but its outside layout is inline within the inline axis.                        |
| [24:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1445.18) | So that's inline flex.                                                                              |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1446.58) | Totally grid, which is block space grid.                                                            |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1449.26) | So it's outer participation in the layout is a block, but it's inner layout is a grid               |
| [24:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1453.36) | and you have inline grid.                                                                           |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1454.78) | So you could have a grid components within an inline axis.                                          |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1459.1)  | That's inline grid.                                                                                 |
| [24:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1460.1)  | Super cool.                                                                                         |
| [24:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1461.1)  | So with all those options, we hope this episode gave you a good starting point for layout.          |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1464.98) | We recommend using floats to float media within text tables to show tabular data flex box           |
| [24:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1470.4)  | and grid, depending on your use case for the layout within it.                                      |
| [24:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3bsih2GEdptNtvMwlfcAMS?&t=1474.42) | And we're definitely going to be diving more into some of these properties in the future.           |
