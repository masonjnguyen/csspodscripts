| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=0.0)    | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast season two, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility    |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=18.04)  | to Z-index.                                                                                          |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=19.04)  | If you're new to the show, be sure to check out any of our last 30 episodes, actually                |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=23.72)  | 29 because this is episode number 30, all about various aspects of CSS, including the                |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=29.52)  | box model, sizing, layout, color, animations, and many, many more.                                   |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=34.68)  | Today we're excited to kick off season two with the topic that is pretty core to styling             |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=39.28)  | on the web, but has seen quite a few changes lately.                                                 |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=42.48)  | And those are lists.                                                                                 |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=44.96)  | We'll talk about what they are, default styles, and how to make them fall in line with your          |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=49.44)  | brand or site style.                                                                                 |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=51.04)  | And I will also add that while preparing for the show, there's a lot of sort of experimental         |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=56.28)  | styles that you can apply to lists and make them go even further than I had even realized            |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=61.68)  | before.                                                                                              |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=62.68)  | Every episode, I learn stuff like that about CSS.                                                    |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=64.8)   | I'm like, wow, the edges of this spec or just all these specs are so awesome.                        |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=69.76)  | And thanks for introducing that we have 29 episodes.                                                 |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=72.32)  | I can't believe it.                                                                                  |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=73.32)  | We've made it to 2021 with that many.                                                                |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=75.2)   | It's been a wild ride.                                                                               |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=76.44)  | And yeah, I love that lists, even old dogs like lists are getting some new kicks from                |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=81.28)  | the CSS working group, which is so awesome.                                                          |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=83.52)  | So like lists structurally are composed of a list container element.                                 |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=87.84)  | Like maybe even it's just your piece of paper that you're putting a dot on and writing a             |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=91.08)  | list item, you know, and these containers are OLs, ULs, or DLs.                                      |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=95.68)  | And we fill these container elements with list items like an LI, a DT, or a DD.                      |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=102.06) | And today we're mostly talking about the list item.                                                  |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=104.64) | It's got some interesting niche attributes to know about, especially when it comes to                |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=107.82) | customizing the styles.                                                                              |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=109.08) | But there are some things that you can put on the container that will be inherited by                |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=112.12) | the list item children.                                                                              |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=113.52) | So let's go through them.                                                                            |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=114.52) | Where do you want to start, Yuna?                                                                    |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=115.52) | Well, I guess we could start with display types because the first thing that you can                 |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=119.58) | do with lists and list styles is to make things look like them.                                      |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=124.38) | You can actually turn things that aren't lists, like not an LI inside of a UL or OL into something   |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=130.5)  | that looks like a list.                                                                              |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=131.8)  | And you can do this with a display or display type of list item.                                     |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=136.1)  | So you can have like a div or another element and give it a display of list item.                    |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=141.8)  | And then you can do like a list style position and position like where you want the list             |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=148.4)  | marker to go inside is one way that you can style that.                                              |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=153.44) | There's a lot of different things that you can do with lists.                                        |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=155.2)  | They do get default styles from the browser.                                                         |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=157.4)  | And so a lot of like reset styles, you'll see them removing like padding and things                  |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=162.44) | from lists to kind of get them to be flattened.                                                      |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=166.08) | But you can have a display type for list item.                                                       |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=168.96) | Now while you can turn anything into something that looks like a list item, there aren't             |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=173.28) | really that many big use cases to do this.                                                           |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=177.2)  | Unlike turning something like an A tag into something that looks like a button for semantic          |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=181.84) | reasons.                                                                                             |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=182.84) | But if you don't have control over the markup of an input, which happens sometimes, you              |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=188.52) | could use display list item to benefit your needs and make those values look like a list             |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=194.8)  | item.                                                                                                |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=195.8)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=196.8)  | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=197.8)  | That makes sense.                                                                                    |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=198.8)  | When I was doing the styling updates into Chromium for markers, it sounded kind of annoying          |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=203.76) | from a developer perspective that a user like us or a CSS user like us can just turn anything        |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=209.56) | into a list item.                                                                                    |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=210.56) | We're like, just like we have this magic wand go poof list item and Chromium goes, oh no,            |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=215.72) | okay, I got this.                                                                                    |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=217.62) | And I just, yeah, I had a lot of empathy for all of the edge cases that had to be handled            |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=221.92) | because of this superpower, this display list item superpower.                                       |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=226.2)  | I have a question.                                                                                   |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=227.2)  | Yes, semantics matter.                                                                               |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=228.2)  | Yeah, they do.                                                                                       |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=229.2)  | And yeah, you shouldn't just be making list items out of anything.                                   |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=231.72) | So even though you have the power, there is responsibility that you must bring to the                |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=235.08) | table.                                                                                               |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=236.14) | List items with their display type, that's a list dash item.                                         |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=239.3)  | And one of the things I remember reading in the spec, and it's just natural, I just hadn't           |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=242.88) | thought of it, was that every list item was a display block by default.                              |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=247.1)  | And if you want a list item to be displayed inline, you can't really do it yet.                      |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=251.9)  | We're waiting for this future spec to come out where you can specify two display types               |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=256.74) | and you'd be able to do display inline block space list item as opposed to the default               |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=262.08) | it is now, like display block list item.                                                             |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=264.6)  | And I don't know, I just thought that was kind of interesting.                                       |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=266.64) | I don't know when I would use inline list items, but I don't know.                                   |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=271.0)  | Well, for menu bars, you'll see a list of links that on larger screens would often be                |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=276.72) | horizontal and inlined.                                                                              |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=278.54) | So I think that's a pretty frequent use case for list items in a navigation.                         |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=282.4)  | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=283.4)  | Well, cool.                                                                                          |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=284.4)  | That was display list item in it.                                                                    |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=285.4)  | So we're on property number one and there's jam-packed things to learn inside of there.              |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=290.04) | So fun.                                                                                              |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=291.04) | Let's talk about the marker pseudo next.                                                             |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=293.12) | So you talk about list item and you said it gets a marker element and these marker pseudo            |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=297.88) | elements are kind of funny.                                                                          |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=300.2)  | This is what we're talking about.                                                                    |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=301.2)  | The marker is the bullet or the hyphen or the Roman numeral that you're using as the                 |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=306.84) | sort of list item indicator because that can go in the before or after.                              |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=311.44) | Anyway, there's no Roman numeral in your HTML.                                                       |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=314.92) | There's no bullet in your HTML when you make a list item.                                            |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=317.0)  | They just appear like, poof, there they are.                                                         |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=320.08) | And they have a limited amount of styling because of that.                                           |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=323.12) | And that's why we call them these pseudo elements is that you can't see them.                        |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=327.2)  | They're like ghost-like in the DOM, but you can reference them and give them some styles.            |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=331.72) | And here's the things that it allows.                                                                |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=333.08) | It allows you to specify an animation, a transition, a color, a direction, like a writing mode       |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=338.76) | direction, left or right or right to left, font styles.                                              |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=341.36) | So font weight and stuff like that.                                                                  |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=343.36) | And properties, you can change it and you can use Unicode Biddy and Whitespace.                      |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=348.2)  | So that is your kind of small list of things that you can style a list item.                         |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=352.44) | You can't do anything under the sun.                                                                 |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=354.72) | So it's kind of interesting to know the limits.                                                      |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=357.16) | And if you did want to style markers, like if you wanted to change the bullet color before,          |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=361.92) | a common way to do this was to take your li and then inside of your li, not just have                |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=366.88) | regular text, but to have a span.                                                                    |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=369.24) | And now what you could do is you could say li color red and then li span color black.                |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=374.52) | Now you have a red dot with black span text inside of there.                                         |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=377.56) | So it was kind of tricky how to get there before, but now you can reference these with               |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=380.92) | this colon colon marker pseudo selector that will find the pseudo elements and give them             |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=386.62) | the styles that you specify in that kind of short list.                                              |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=389.28) | Anyway, I hope that explains the marker element well.                                                |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=392.16) | Yeah, I mean, super handy that we have a pseudo selector that you can now apply styling to           |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=397.4)  | that previously was pretty limited.                                                                  |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=401.72) | Not super limited.                                                                                   |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=402.72) | We're going to talk about different ways that you could style the marker after that segment          |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=406.84) | now, like in the podcast.                                                                            |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=408.56) | But that gives you even more control and power and just a more refined way to style that             |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=414.18) | marker on your list item.                                                                            |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=416.88) | So there are a few list styles that you can apply.                                                   |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=420.0)  | One of those is list style image.                                                                    |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=421.98) | So list style image accepts either nothing, none or a URL value, and you can actually                |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=428.0)  | even do a data URI.                                                                                  |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=429.0)  | It can accept any media type.                                                                        |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=431.36) | So this would enable you to set an image like an SVG or a GIF even as a list marker.                 |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=437.2)  | And you could create your design, have like a cute little icon and then use those for                |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=441.6)  | your list markers.                                                                                   |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=444.04) | I feel like there should be a better word for this because it's called list style image.             |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=448.32) | I don't want to confuse it with the marker pseudo, but just the little dot slash other               |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=455.28) | item slash disk slash whatever you want to call it, that thing can get a list style image.           |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=459.8)  | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=460.8)  | Yeah, you can specify.                                                                               |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=461.84) | It could be like a spinning sun, you know, it's like blooming.                                       |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=465.16) | Yeah, you could have an animated GIF.                                                                |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=466.56) | You can have an animated GIF in there.                                                               |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=467.72) | It'd be really cool.                                                                                 |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=468.72) | We also have list style type after list style image and the support right now is everywhere          |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=473.08) | but Safari.                                                                                          |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=474.08) | It's in their tech preview.                                                                          |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=475.12) | So list style type is kind of this interesting way you can be like all of my bullets on this         |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=478.3)  | list.                                                                                                |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=479.3)  | So you set this on the container and you go all of the bullets are an emoji and then poof,           |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=484.32) | they're all an emoji and it's sort of this one property that you can just sort of, anyway,           |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=488.36) | it's really cool.                                                                                    |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=489.36) | And there's different types that you can pass in there that are built in.                            |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=491.64) | So you can specify your own custom string or you could say something like the word disk              |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=496.8)  | or yeah, there's other ones in here.                                                                 |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=498.8)  | Do you know of any, Yuna, that you like to use?                                                      |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=500.88) | So disk tends to be the default value, right?                                                        |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=506.4)  | There's also square, which instead of a filled circle like a disk is a filled square.                |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=511.72) | You can do things with like numbers.                                                                 |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=515.4)  | So you could have decimals and you could have decimals with the leading zero, but there's            |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=520.12) | only one leading zero.                                                                               |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=521.28) | You only get one.                                                                                    |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=522.28) | So it's like zero one, zero two, zero three, but then you get 10.                                    |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=526.8)  | And there's various like numberings that are different based on different languages.                 |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=532.92) | So Georgian is one example.                                                                          |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=534.96) | You have traditional Georgian numbering, but there's also a few other language values like           |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=538.4)  | Armenian, Cambodian, Hebrew that are experimental.                                                   |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=542.76) | So do your browser testing.                                                                          |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=543.76) | I don't think that these are in many browsers yet.                                                   |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=546.92) | Georgian is, but these other list style values are things that you can set for your list             |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=551.6)  | style type.                                                                                          |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=552.6)  | What else is there?                                                                                  |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=553.6)  | Yeah, there's lots of little fun ones.                                                               |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=554.6)  | Well, there's circle.                                                                                |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=555.6)  | Some of these are weirdly named to me.                                                               |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=556.92) | Like circle is actually a ring.                                                                      |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=559.96) | So you said disk, which is a filled circle, which I guess makes sense.                               |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=563.04) | Yeah, disk and then circle is not a, anyway, it's a ring.                                            |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=566.36) | And then decimals, I'm like, those are integers.                                                     |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=569.12) | There's no dot one, dot two.                                                                         |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=571.0)  | Why are they called decimals?                                                                        |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=572.72) | I'm not sure.                                                                                        |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=573.72) | But yeah, so you can do integers, you can do circles and all these different, there's                |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=576.72) | even cooler ones like triangles too.                                                                 |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=578.52) | But I also tested out the traditional Chinese versus, or it's called traditional Chinese             |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=582.98) | informal and traditional Chinese formal.                                                             |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=585.44) | So formal and informal numberings.                                                                   |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=588.04) | And they were really cool.                                                                           |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=589.04) | The formal was like a full Chinese character and the informal looked like this minimal               |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=595.24) | representation of it.                                                                                |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=596.48) | And I just liked that there was this, I don't know, I just love it when things are minimal.          |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=600.28) | So it was kind of cool as a fun one to try.                                                          |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=602.08) | There's tons of others in there.                                                                     |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=604.4)  | And have you put any custom strings in yours before?                                                 |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=606.6)  | Like the little raccoon, like the little right angled thing or any emoji of each?                    |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=610.92) | I don't know, do you ever customize this?                                                            |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=612.52) | I have customized, like I like the circle more than the disk.                                        |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=615.88) | I think it's cute and I would customize like the color values.                                       |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=620.44) | I haven't really used emojis as my marker for a string before, for a list before, but                |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=626.08) | I think that I would at some point in the future.                                                    |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=628.16) | I just feel like I usually will do regular lists and then I'll have emojis that are different        |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=632.52) | that signify like something in the list.                                                             |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=635.0)  | So I can't say that I have a lot of customization experience for lists right now, but I actually     |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=641.62) | saw a lot of cool use cases when I was perusing some of the custom list counters that are            |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=647.36) | kind of what I want to talk about next.                                                              |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=649.24) | Yeah, do it.                                                                                         |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=650.68) | So the last thing that I want to talk about today about lists is this idea of custom counter         |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=656.88) | styles.                                                                                              |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=657.88) | And this sort of leads into our next show, which is all about at rules.                              |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=662.08) | But essentially with at counter style, you can set your own custom counters for things               |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=667.8)  | that aren't already predefined.                                                                      |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=669.4)  | So we went over a bunch of things that are predefined.                                               |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=671.04) | We talked about how you could style the marker.                                                      |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=674.16) | But if you wanted to create an entire counter set for the counting of a list, you could              |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=679.8)  | use this spec.                                                                                       |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=680.84) | So just to note, this is currently only implemented in Firefox, but it is a candidate recommendation |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=686.36) | in CSS counter styles level three.                                                                   |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=688.34) | And the way that you would use this is you would have at counter style, you give it a                |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=692.88) | name and then within that you would have a system, symbols, and if there's a suffix or               |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=697.24) | not.                                                                                                 |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=698.24) | So an example of that would be like at counter style circled alpha and then your system would        |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=703.24) | be fixed, which means that you're only going to be using the symbols that you input.                 |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=707.52) | And then with your symbols, you can add items here.                                                  |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=710.56) | So in this example, there's like this sort of font with the letters of the alphabet within           |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=716.92) | a circle and those are the symbols used here.                                                        |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=719.56) | You can also use images right now, but that might get removed.                                       |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=724.16) | So I saw a cool example with using like Olympic medals for this.                                     |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=727.56) | Cool.                                                                                                |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=728.56) | And yeah, it was just cool.                                                                          |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=729.56) | There's like a lot of different ways that you can use this.                                          |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=731.48) | So once you set your counter style with like at counter style and the name, you can use              |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=736.68) | it through list style type and then the name.                                                        |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=739.0)  | So list style type circled alpha or list style type medals.                                          |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=743.2)  | And so that system value, as I mentioned before, defines how you go through the symbols, like        |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=750.32) | the counter system.                                                                                  |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=751.52) | So fixed, you go through it once, cyclic, you run through it and then you go back to                 |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=754.84) | the start and you run through it again.                                                              |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=756.24) | So this would be like the letters of the alphabet and then you start back at A. There's symbolic,    |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=760.76) | which the cycle repeats through all the provided symbols and it doubles them.                        |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=765.64) | So once you've gone from A to Z, it would do like AA, BB, CCC, DD.                                   |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=772.08) | Like it would start going that way and then triples them, et cetera.                                 |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=774.44) | And then there's numeric, which I thought was fascinating because you could set the                  |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=777.66) | symbols to only be like zero, one and two.                                                           |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=780.64) | And then if you have the system be numeric, the counter would be one, two and then the               |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=786.84) | next number would be 10 and then 11, 12 and then 20.                                                 |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=791.28) | So you'd kind of go back up.                                                                         |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=792.76) | So this is kind of riding me like if you had zero, one, you kind of could do like a binary           |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=796.4)  | like visual representation.                                                                          |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=797.4)  | Yeah, so I just thought that this is like a fascinating micro syntax and you can do                  |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=801.96) | a lot of fun things here but it's not very well supported.                                           |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=804.44) | Yeah, as soon as you started going with that example, I'm like, well, okay, so that emoji            |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=808.18) | example, you could just fill up a whole set of your favorite 20 emoji and then all of                |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=812.28) | your lists for the rest of your site, you just say, hey, use this list style type, specify           |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=816.52) | your custom counter style and boom, anywhere you have emojis, they just kind of keep cycling         |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=820.28) | through.                                                                                             |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=821.28) | It'd be really neat.                                                                                 |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=822.28) | Yeah, that's true.                                                                                   |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=823.28) | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=824.28) | I love that.                                                                                         |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=825.28) | And counters are super packed with fun opportunities and potential.                                  |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=827.88) | I'm excited.                                                                                         |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=828.88) | We'll probably do a whole episode on it one day.                                                     |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=830.36) | They are complex.                                                                                    |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=831.36) | Thanks for that breakdown.                                                                           |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=832.36) | I didn't know that that was a candidate rec.                                                         |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=834.2)  | I love it.                                                                                           |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=835.3)  | Let's talk about lists.                                                                              |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=836.3)  | Yeah, me either.                                                                                     |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=837.3)  | Yeah, we learned so much studying for this podcast.                                                  |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=840.04) | It's awesome.                                                                                        |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=841.04) | There's list style position, which I think you mentioned already, which is you can be                |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=845.56) | inside or outside.                                                                                   |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=846.76) | And so this is sort of like in terms of your box as a list style item, should it be in               |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=851.16) | your box or outside of your box?                                                                     |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=853.44) | And the first element among the list items contents, if it's inside will be your marker              |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=857.92) | and if it's outside, it's not included in the list items contents.                                   |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=861.18) | So that's sort of the delineating factor there for those.                                            |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=863.92) | And then finally we have the list style shorthand, which is how you're probably going to see         |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=868.8)  | list style settings most often.                                                                      |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=870.88) | It is the most commonly used property of all the ones that we talked about today.                    |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=875.28) | And it is a shorthand for setting the list style image, list style position and list                 |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=879.6)  | style type all in one.                                                                               |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=881.2)  | I definitely use this most frequently as like list style none to just hide default styles,           |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=885.08) | but you can also use it to set styles.                                                               |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=887.12) | Of course, like list style square inside, you know, you can do list style circle outside,            |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=892.2)  | or you could put the list style image first and then set the position and kind of do all             |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=896.84) | your styling with just list style.                                                                   |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=898.88) | Oh, CSS, you're so expressive.                                                                       |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=901.68) | So that brings us to the end of our show on lists, a nice little recap of existing tech,             |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=907.16) | existing APIs that you can use for lists.                                                            |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=908.92) | And also we talked about some of the things that are sort of upcoming and experimental.              |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=914.04) | Yeah, it's a little bizarre that marker styling is so new that it has taken this long to provide     |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=920.6)  | an API to specifically target those bullets as opposed to us creating extra markup and               |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=925.84) | wrappers to give us access to simulated styling of those markers.                                    |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=929.52) | Yeah, I'm glad we're here where we are.                                                              |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/285lGk0afcLFyOid6SEJU3?&t=931.36) | So I'm not upset.                                                                                    |
