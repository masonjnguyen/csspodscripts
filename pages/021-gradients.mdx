| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.                |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=17.92)   | Today we're mad for gradients.                                                                          |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=19.52)   | Gradients.                                                                                              |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=20.52)   | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=21.52)   | That's right.                                                                                           |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=22.52)   | We're talking CSS gradients and all of their gradient goodness.                                         |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=27.78)   | Gradients are one of my favorite things to play around with in CSS and there is so much                 |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=32.52)   | you can do with them.                                                                                   |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=33.52)   | I agree.                                                                                                |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=34.52)   | Well, let's do a little background on like a gradient and what it is and like how it                    |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=38.56)   | paints and where it goes.                                                                               |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=39.96)   | And a gradient is an image and it's essentially smoothly fading one color to the next.                  |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=44.68)   | And another way to say smoothly fading is interpolating.                                                |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=47.92)   | We're going from one color to the next and we're letting the computer along a curve and                 |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=51.16)   | figure out how those colors transition.                                                                 |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=53.56)   | And it's defined as an image in our CSS and it's made up of angles, color stops, and color              |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=58.94)   | hints.                                                                                                  |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=59.94)   | At its most simplest, the CSS for making a linear gradient is just linear dash gradient                 |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=64.82)   | and open up a parentheses and pass two colors like hot pink and Rebecca purple, close your              |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=69.54)   | parentheses and you have yourself a linear gradient from top to bottom, from hot pink                   |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=73.56)   | to purple.                                                                                              |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=74.56)   | Super easy, but it gets really complex and really powerful from there.                                  |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=78.16)   | Then one of the first terms we're going to talk about is color stops.                                   |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=81.62)   | And this is the term for the color of the gradient and where it should be along this                    |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=85.9)    | like curve that they're going to be working on.                                                         |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=87.6)    | Oh, anyway, we'll get into it because they can be percentage based or length based.                     |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=91.02)   | They can literally be like you want it to be this many pixels wide or it can be something               |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=95.74)   | much more soft than that.                                                                               |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=97.0)    | So we'll get into that.                                                                                 |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=98.06)   | There's also transition hints, which are like a color stop, but they're more about a hint               |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=103.52)  | about where the middle point should be between two colors.                                              |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=106.62)  | So an interesting thing, we'll talk about how color stops and color hints interact and                  |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=110.24)  | how they overlap.                                                                                       |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=111.62)  | And that's what the value is of this podcast, right?                                                    |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=113.68)  | We're going to dig into that stuff.                                                                     |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=114.96)  | So a transition hint is that color hint that's placed between two stops.                                |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=118.96)  | It's also used because it can make a curve happen.                                                      |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=121.22)  | So if you want a linear gradient tonight, it should be linear.                                          |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=124.08)  | A transition hint is how you can do that.                                                               |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=125.8)   | And we'll cover that.                                                                                   |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=126.8)   | The stops also in a gradient don't have to add up to 100%.                                              |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=129.76)  | So like when you're in a design tool, they make it feel like it has to be 0%, 100%.                     |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=133.44)  | But on the web, they can be anywhere.                                                                   |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=135.4)   | You can go below or beyond the space of the container that's being drawn into.                          |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=139.8)   | And that can help you make gradients that maybe look more soft.                                         |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=142.68)  | There's also something called the color stop fix up.                                                    |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=145.16)  | And this is where automatically things will be assigned a length.                                       |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=147.88)  | So a color stop can be given a length dynamically.                                                      |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=150.0)   | It's kind of interesting.                                                                               |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=151.84)  | And I think that pretty much ramps everybody up to what a gradient is and what it's made                |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=155.88)  | of.                                                                                                     |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=156.88)  | And it's time for us to jump into the types.                                                            |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=158.12)  | You want to lead us into the types of gradients we have on the web?                                     |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=160.32)  | Yeah, sure.                                                                                             |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=161.32)  | So the first type of gradient is the linear gradient.                                                   |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=164.04)  | So a linear gradient would be a line from one color to another.                                         |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=168.52)  | The syntax of this is linear dash gradient and then in parentheses, you have your angle                 |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=173.36)  | and you have your color stop list, which also includes your color hints and color stops.                |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=179.0)   | So the angle can take turns, radians, degrees, etc.                                                     |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=183.76)  | You're probably going to see either a degree value here or have that be a keyword like                  |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=189.24)  | to bottom, to top, to right, to left.                                                                   |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=193.6)   | That can be used as the angle.                                                                          |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=196.0)   | And you can also have these be positive or negative.                                                    |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=198.84)  | So that angle, if you use like negative 45 degrees, that's totally valid as well.                       |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=204.08)  | Now the default here is to bottom, which is zero degrees top to bottom.                                 |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=208.72)  | And you need to have two colors in a linear gradient for it to show up.                                 |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=212.6)   | That's the baseline of what you need.                                                                   |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=214.12)  | So you got to set those color values.                                                                   |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=216.08)  | The default also is a 50% color hint.                                                                   |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=218.16)  | So it's going to evenly distribute color from the top to the bottom within that 50% point               |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=224.04)  | of transition.                                                                                          |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=225.28)  | Although sometimes this doesn't look very smooth.                                                       |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=227.28)  | So there are ways to smooth that out.                                                                   |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=230.28)  | So keywords here, I briefly mentioned you have to top, to right, to top right, which                    |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=235.2)   | would be the same as 45 degrees or to top left, which is the same as negative 45 degrees.               |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=240.76)  | With linear gradient, if you had an example of something like linear gradient to top right,             |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=245.4)   | red comma white comma blue, this would be the same as a linear gradient of 45 degrees                   |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=251.04)  | from red to white to blue.                                                                              |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=253.0)   | You could have as many colors in there as you want.                                                     |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=254.76)  | You could have 100 colors if you want.                                                                  |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=256.6)   | Makes things really colorful with all these different color stop locations that are set                 |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=261.28)  | at different intervals.                                                                                 |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=262.76)  | So another example here is using linear gradient pink to orange.                                        |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=266.16)  | This would be top to bottom gradient with pink at the top smoothly transitioning to                     |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=270.64)  | orange.                                                                                                 |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=271.64)  | I actually really like these colors together.                                                           |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=273.28)  | You could do a linear gradient of maybe pink to orange or linear gradient of pink comma                 |
| [04:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=279.04)  | 50% comma orange.                                                                                       |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=280.6)   | These would be the same thing.                                                                          |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=281.6)   | This would also be the same thing as linear gradient pink 0% comma orange 100%.                         |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=287.12)  | So there's just a lot of different ways to write gradients and their color stops, but                   |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=290.52)  | they would look the same in these cases.                                                                |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=292.48)  | Totally.                                                                                                |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=293.48)  | It's like when I go to the gradient generators, which I've done, I don't know, a billion times          |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=297.24)  | in my career, it's like I go to Colorzilla and I'm like, I just want to make a simple                   |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=301.28)  | little gradient because I'm not a robot and I don't have this syntax memorized.                         |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=304.56)  | And then it gives me back this like giant linear gradient code.                                         |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=309.84)  | And these days, now that I know the syntax and I don't use that tool as much, I look                    |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=313.56)  | at the syntax and I'm like, Oh man, this makes gradients look way harder than they are.                 |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=318.42)  | So thanks for breaking down those like simple use cases.                                                |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=320.74)  | I think that's important.                                                                               |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=322.4)   | We've got radial gradients next.                                                                        |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=324.54)  | So this syntax here is radial dash gradient with an open parentheses.                                   |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=329.0)   | And the first parameter it takes is called an ending shape.                                             |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=332.4)   | And then you specify a comma and you say the size of that shape or the size of this circle              |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=337.36)  | that you want to do.                                                                                    |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=338.36)  | And this is also optional.                                                                              |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=339.36)  | And you say comma at position.                                                                          |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=341.84)  | And so it takes a shape, a size, a position, and then the rest of the color list.                       |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=346.04)  | So the color stop list, just as you would a normal gradient.                                            |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=348.4)   | And it's kind of interesting.                                                                           |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=349.54)  | So what is an ending shape?                                                                             |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=351.24)  | The ending shape is either circle or ellipse and will intelligently default to either depending         |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=356.9)   | on how many parameters were passed.                                                                     |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=358.76)  | So if you pass one parameter, it's like, I think you want a circle of equal size based                  |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=363.68)  | on this one parameter.                                                                                  |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=364.68)  | And if you pass two, it goes, Oh, I think I'll do the top and the bottom of this one                    |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=367.28)  | and the left and right this.                                                                            |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=368.28)  | So it can be a sumtive, which is nice.                                                                  |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=370.36)  | So that was for ending shape.                                                                           |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=372.08)  | There's also size.                                                                                      |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=373.2)   | So size is a length value that you need to pass.                                                        |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=375.88)  | It can be percentage, but it can't be anything negative, which is kind of interesting.                  |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=379.62)  | And it also has a sweet list of keywords.                                                               |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=381.54)  | So you can specify a size as something like one rem or 10 pixels.                                       |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=385.24)  | And that can be really nice if you want to make like polka dots or something like that.                 |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=388.74)  | But if you want to make something that's dynamic to the size of the thing it's inside of, you'd         |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=391.96)  | use a relative unit.                                                                                    |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=393.6)   | But there's also these cool relative keywords, right?                                                   |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=397.04)  | We have closest side, farthest side.                                                                    |

| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=409.96)  | I think I say farthest.                                                                                 |

| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=412.96)  | Anyway, weird.                                                                                          |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=413.96)  | So in CSS it's farthest.                                                                                |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=415.46)  | So we have closest dash side, farthest dash side, closest dash corner and furthest dash                 |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=421.28)  | corner.                                                                                                 |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=422.28)  | Interestingly, the default is the furthest corner.                                                      |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=424.4)   | I even wrote furthest, but it's the farthest corner.                                                    |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=426.96)  | I'm just confusing myself in my own notes.                                                              |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=428.88)  | I wrote it as furthest.                                                                                 |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=430.24)  | I guess I say furthest.                                                                                 |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=431.68)  | In CSS it's farthest.                                                                                   |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=433.44)  | I think it's farthest, like far, because fur is a word that means like a material.                      |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=438.44)  | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=439.44)  | Oh, maybe furthest.                                                                                     |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=440.44)  | I'll have to go.                                                                                        |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=441.44)  | Now I just want to, what does furthest mean when it's like fur relevant?                                |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=444.12)  | That sounds fun.                                                                                        |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=445.36)  | Anyway, we have these different corner values that are really interesting to use.                       |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=450.0)   | So yeah, closest side, furthest side.                                                                   |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=451.4)   | Then we have position.                                                                                  |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=452.8)   | Position determines where the center should be.                                                         |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=454.4)   | So where's this circle going to start?                                                                  |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=456.48)  | And it's not from the top left.                                                                         |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=458.56)  | So interesting, most things are positioned from the XY coordinate and with a radial gradient,           |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=463.72)  | they're not.                                                                                            |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=464.72)  | They're positioned from the center.                                                                     |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=465.72)  | It also has a fun use of the at word.                                                                   |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=467.36)  | So if you are going to specify a position, you have to say at in front of it.                           |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=471.32)  | So it's kind of cool.                                                                                   |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=472.32)  | You could have like a circle, the length goes to the furthest corner that it can find starting          |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=477.44)  | at center, center.                                                                                      |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=479.08)  | Here's hot pink and Rebecca purple.                                                                     |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=481.08)  | So the syntax is kind of fun in that the radial gradient needs to be told, do you want to               |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=485.12)  | be a perfect circle or not?                                                                             |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=487.48)  | What are the colors, right?                                                                             |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=488.48)  | The color list, obviously.                                                                              |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=489.92)  | But then like how big should it be and where do you want its position?                                  |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=493.16)  | And I've seen some cool tricks where position can be just the only thing that's changed.                |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=496.48)  | So you can say in a responsive media query, you could have at position be like at var                   |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=500.56)  | and you can have a positional var.                                                                      |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=502.2)   | And in a media query, change the position to top left or center, center based on how                    |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=506.2)   | you want it to look on mobile versus desktop.                                                           |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=508.68)  | So kind of like cool little tricks.                                                                     |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=510.28)  | So once you know these little niche syntax items, you can pivot things really subtly                    |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=514.52)  | in your CSS.                                                                                            |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=515.7)   | So hopefully that helped you with the essentials of the radial gradient syntax.                         |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=519.4)   | Yeah, that's an interesting use case of using a custom property to change values around                 |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=524.08)  | in a gradient.                                                                                          |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=525.76)  | But note that without specifying a Houdini custom property that has a syntax, these gradients           |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=531.8)   | will not animate.                                                                                       |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=532.8)   | And that's because gradients are considered images.                                                     |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=535.36)  | They're rendered as such as full images.                                                                |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=537.92)  | But when you are using registered custom properties that have syntaxes, you can actually animate        |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=542.68)  | between the values because they have an interpolation ability since you're setting the syntax to        |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=547.36)  | a specific value.                                                                                       |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=548.36)  | So whether that's color stops or color values, or even position, if the position is like                |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=553.02)  | a percentage or degree, you could do that.                                                              |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=556.08)  | You can't do it with keywords.                                                                          |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=557.08)  | Hot tip.                                                                                                |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=558.08)  | No, that was awesome.                                                                                   |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=559.08)  | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=560.08)  | So the next gradient and the last gradient is the conic gradient.                                       |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=563.32)  | And conic gradients are part of the level four spec for CSS images.                                     |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=567.36)  | If you are interested in conic gradients, definitely check out Leah Verou's work.                       |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=571.52)  | She is basically the reason that we have conic gradients in browsers.                                   |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=575.04)  | And she's done great talks about them that I've seen.                                                   |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=577.8)   | That's the first time I've actually even heard of conic gradients in browsers.                          |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=581.08)  | And she's written a lot of blog posts and samples.                                                      |

| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=586.68)  | Highly would recommend it.                                                                              |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=588.12)  | Conic gradients have a center point within an element and start from a point in which                   |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=593.2)   | you specify, going around in a 360 degree circle.                                                       |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=597.18)  | So use your imagination with me real quick.                                                             |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=600.2)   | The way that you can think of a conic gradient is if you have like a squeegee or like a long            |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=605.8)   | mop and you fix one point, you anchor the bottom of the squeegee and then rotate it                     |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=611.24)  | around itself until you make a complete circle.                                                         |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=614.76)  | That is a conic rotation.                                                                               |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=616.72)  | Like a compass?                                                                                         |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=617.72)  | Yeah, like a compass.                                                                                   |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=618.72)  | That's a good way to think about it.                                                                    |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=619.78)  | Like a clock even that goes around in a circle.                                                         |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=623.12)  | So if you start and end with the same color value, the cone will look continuous.                       |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=628.3)   | So if your conic gradient was like red, yellow, red, that would look like a continuous cone.            |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=633.9)   | But if you start and end with two different color values, so if it was a conic gradient                 |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=638.44)  | with a red, yellow, you would have a visible seam dividing the start and the end line.                  |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=644.44)  | So the syntax here allows you to also adjust placement, just like with radial gradient,                 |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=649.56)  | of the position and the angle at which you're starting.                                                 |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=653.56)  | So you can create a conic gradient by setting that angle of rotation.                                   |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=659.76)  | You have the angle, the position, and the list of color stops as the arguments here.                    |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=664.32)  | So if you were to set that angle to say 45 degrees, you would see that start anchor at                  |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=670.56)  | 45 degrees.                                                                                             |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=671.72)  | Now the angle is zero degrees by default, so that's why if you don't have an angle                      |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=675.44)  | there you'll see it starting straight up and down and going around that way.                            |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=678.78)  | And then this does, it's not just a circle, it extends out to the rest of the div.                      |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=681.7)   | So like it'll extend out to the rest of that element and fill the space.                                |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=685.12)  | So the position here specifies the actual point where the rotation is, not just the                     |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=689.74)  | degree in which the rotation starts.                                                                    |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=692.72)  | And it is center by default, but you can specify the placement using a percentage-based position        |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=699.24)  | like 20%, 20%, and then it would be rotated from the top left quadrant in that element.                 |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=706.68)  | So color stops work like any other gradient where you can add stops within a comma or                   |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=712.56)  | you can add color hints between commas.                                                                 |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=715.32)  | And the difference here for the radial gradient is that you need to use degrees, radians,               |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=721.24)  | turns, or percentages to create conic gradient stops, unlike linear and radial gradients                |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=727.48)  | where a pixel value would work.                                                                         |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=730.04)  | So conic gradient is written as conic dash gradient and in parentheses you can say from                 |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=734.52)  | zero deg at center, comma, black, comma, 50%, comma, white.                                             |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=740.52)  | That would be a very default gradient.                                                                  |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=742.44)  | It would be the same as writing conic gradient in parentheses, black, comma, white.                     |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=746.96)  | So you can specify all those things if you want to.                                                     |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=749.7)   | The support is pretty good.                                                                             |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=752.2)   | All modern browsers except for Firefox support this.                                                    |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=755.46)  | It also doesn't work in Internet Explorer.                                                              |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=757.58)  | So depending on your definition, pretty good.                                                           |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=759.44)  | I'd actually say that's not great.                                                                      |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=761.52)  | Specifically because Firefox isn't supported and it does have such a big market share.                  |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=765.4)   | So this is like maybe don't use it, but there's also a polyfill that you can use                        |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=770.24)  | for conic gradients.                                                                                    |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=771.5)   | So maybe use that, you know.                                                                            |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=774.24)  | There's a lot of different use cases.                                                                   |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=775.98)  | One is you can recreate the color wheel with this.                                                      |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=777.92)  | You can layer a rainbow conic gradient underneath a black transparent radial gradient where             |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=784.92)  | it goes from dark to light on the outside or dark to transparent.                                       |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=789.04)  | You can have multiple layered gradients as a space-separated list of values within any                  |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=793.84)  | background declaration.                                                                                 |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=795.8)   | So it would look like background, radial gradient, and then you would have a gray to transparent        |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=800.6)   | or you could even start with a darker color to transparent.                                             |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=803.0)   | You could start with black to transparent if you want that full range or 50% gray to                    |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=807.04)  | be your color picker hue.                                                                               |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=809.2)   | And then you would have comma, conic gradient, and in parentheses, red, magenta, blue, aqua,            |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=814.56)  | lime, yellow, red.                                                                                      |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=816.04)  | And this starts and ends with the same color, so it's a continuous circle.                              |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=819.92)  | This was an example actually from the working groups back then.                                         |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=822.44)  | I thought it was interesting.                                                                           |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=823.44)  | You can also create pie charts with this because you can have an element that is round that             |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=829.36)  | uses correlating percentages of starting endpoints to create that pie chart.                            |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=836.44)  | If you have a gradient with the exact same value as the endpoint and start point for                    |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=841.24)  | the next color, it'll create a sharp line.                                                              |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=844.04)  | So that's how you do these.                                                                             |

| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=871.8)   | She's also animating it with Houdini worklet so just like you were talking about the gradient           |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=876.4)   | is an image and she wanted it to slowly spin and in order to do that, she had to invoke                 |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=881.8)   | Houdini with some custom properties.                                                                    |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=883.66)  | So really, really neat stuff.                                                                           |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=885.88)  | And then with gradient stops, there's a fun trick that if you use in a row, so if it takes              |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=889.44)  | like in this case, if you say zero as the stop position, it will always hard line with                  |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=895.36)  | the previous item.                                                                                      |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=896.36)  | So you don't have to know where the previous item came from.                                            |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=898.34)  | You can just zero them all out and you'll get hard shapes all the way around.                           |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=902.28)  | So I think this is even in like our tips and tricks at the bottom.                                      |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=905.28)  | But yeah, gradients, if you want a hard stop, just either use zero degrees or zero percent              |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=909.98)  | and just like a hot tip anyway, repeating gradients.                                                    |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=913.72)  | I think I brought that up because like repeating gradients seems to be a case where I use these         |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=916.88)  | a lot where I want like checkerboards or I want polka dots or patterns, which also means                |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=921.22)  | you need background size and stuff, but we'll get into that.                                            |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=923.78)  | The repeating gradients are cool because it subtly reminds me of the difference between                 |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=928.4)   | grid template columns and grid auto columns where templates are like sized and static                   |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=932.8)   | and auto like grid auto columns will repeat the template until all items have a place.                  |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=937.84)  | This feels a lot to me like how the gradients work, like literally the same code can be                 |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=941.12)  | used in either auto columns or template columns or the same gradient could be put into a linear         |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=945.96)  | gradient or repeating linear gradient.                                                                  |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=948.34)  | It just depends on whether or not it repeats.                                                           |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=950.8)   | So kind of cool.                                                                                        |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=951.8)   | These are really great for like patterns and textures.                                                  |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=954.08)  | So you can repeat a linear gradient.                                                                    |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=955.8)   | The syntax again is the same as where you came from.                                                    |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=957.96)  | And if the gradient doesn't appear to repeat, it might be because the size is 100 percent.              |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=963.02)  | So it's filling the space.                                                                              |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=964.28)  | It seems like when you're first thinking about a gradient, you generally want to fill a box.            |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=969.32)  | But later you'll start to find other use cases where instead of filling the box, you want               |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=973.6)   | the gradient to fill 20 percent of the space and then repeat for the rest.                              |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=978.04)  | And maybe you wanted to make lined paper type of effect or something.                                   |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=981.22)  | It's just kind of interesting if you're not seeing the effect of your repeating linear                  |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=984.16)  | gradient, it might be because the first size of the paint that you described is just the                |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=989.32)  | full area of where you're specifying it.                                                                |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=991.32)  | So anyway, just a small little tip.                                                                     |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=993.36)  | Make sure that you're setting a size in your repeating gradients.                                       |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=996.08)  | I think it'll ensure that you're getting the result that you want.                                      |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=999.0)   | You can also use length units here.                                                                     |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1001.6)  | So if you have an undefined amount of space and you want to fill the whole thing like                   |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1005.92) | lined paper example, you probably want to use pixels or ems or rems in that case so                     |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1011.12) | that you would have it just fill the entire space that's not percentage based.                          |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1014.96) | So I would say like a rule of thumb is you usually want percentage based when you have                  |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1019.0)  | a set gradient and you usually want length based when you have an unknown sized gradient.               |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1024.88) | That is an excellent tip.                                                                               |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1026.7)  | Hot tip number two.                                                                                     |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1027.7)  | Yeah, if you're using a repeating gradient, use like a length, something less relative                  |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1032.24) | and make sure you're not filling the space.                                                             |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1034.02) | Good call.                                                                                              |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1035.02) | Use better for regular gradients and links and other values for your repeating ones.                    |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1040.84) | Nice.                                                                                                   |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1041.84) | I love it.                                                                                              |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1042.84) | With the repeating radial gradient, the syntax is the same as the radial gradient that we               |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1046.52) | covered earlier.                                                                                        |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1047.72) | But a kind of tip here is to maximize results from this one is to accompany them with background        |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1052.08) | size, repeat and position and the ability to take on multiple backgrounds.                              |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1056.14) | So there's like a gallery we'll put in the show notes here.                                             |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1058.28) | Leo Verou made it.                                                                                      |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1059.36) | It's called the CSS three pattern gallery.                                                              |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1061.36) | You may have been there before and it essentially shows you how these different repeating               |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1064.92) | gradients can be used with a pattern system.                                                            |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1068.44) | So you can essentially define a swatch like a little pattern in a square and then cause                 |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1072.38) | it to repeat.                                                                                           |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1073.52) | And as the edges touch, you can make it seamless and create this infinitely coverable.                  |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1077.64) | It'll cover any paint space with a nice kind of fixed size repeating gradient.                          |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1082.16) | So anyway, we'll have that in the show notes.                                                           |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1083.68) | It's really rad.                                                                                        |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1084.74) | And then the one that blew our minds when we were studying for this was repeating conic                 |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1088.44) | gradient.                                                                                               |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1089.44) | We looked at each other and we're like, oh, well, this conic gradient be repeated?                      |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1093.4)  | We're like, no, that'd be, that's too crazy.                                                            |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1095.28) | And then we go look it up.                                                                              |
| [18:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1096.28) | We're like supported.                                                                                   |

| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1155.92) | So then right next to it was this repeating radial gradient and essentially you get a                   |
| [19:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1159.6)  | target so you can define a circle to another circle to another circle and it repeats infinitely         |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1164.4)  | and you get this target effect.                                                                         |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1165.4)  | So you can imagine that as a box is expanding or contracting, you're just seeing more or                |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1169.0)  | less stripes of the target versus the repeating conic gradient, which had like little pieces            |

| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1176.32) | So kind of interesting.                                                                                 |

| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1178.88) | I do want to like talk really quick too in doing some research here.                                    |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1182.56) | I saw that Lee of Roo's header.                                                                         |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1184.04) | I mentioned that it was a repeating conic gradient that she was animating it, but the                   |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1187.56) | CSS that she wrote for it is just amazing.                                                              |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1190.28) | And then of course it's fixed, which is kind of cool.                                                   |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1192.64) | It gives us a sort of like parallax effect and then she animates it with Houdini.                       |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1197.32) | So it's like she barely wrote any CSS.                                                                  |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1199.8)  | I'd say it's like, I don't know, four lines of CSS and she has this really, really powerful,            |
| [20:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1204.2)  | dynamic, adjustable header that's all done with conic gradient.                                         |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1207.96) | It just seemed so perfect for her to have done since she made conic gradient happen.                    |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1213.12) | And anyway, it's very cool.                                                                             |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1214.6)  | We'll have a link to that on show notes.                                                                |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1215.84) | You should go check it out.                                                                             |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1217.2)  | So then after we have like repeating conic gradients, we have regular linear gradients.                 |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1220.76) | I want to mention that you can mix these things together cause maybe it wasn't obvious, but             |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1224.96) | like with multiple backgrounds, you can have multiple gradients, which means you can have               |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1228.8)  | multiple gradient types so you could mix and match them all together.                                   |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1232.56) | Like you could have a linear gradient comma.                                                            |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1234.88) | So you could have like imagine the CSS.                                                                 |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1236.28) | We have multiple background image and we have a linear gradient as the first background                 |
| [20:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1239.96) | image.                                                                                                  |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1240.96) | We have a conic gradient as the second background image, a radial gradient as the third background      |
| [20:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1244.72) | image, and then we just say hot pink.                                                                   |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1247.12) | And so it would layer all of those together.                                                            |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1249.28) | We have a base of hot pink with a radial and a conic and a linear gradient all on top of                |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1253.28) | each other.                                                                                             |
| [20:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1254.28) | I don't know why you'd use that, but I just wanted to make notes.                                       |

| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1257.76) | It's kind of fun.                                                                                       |

| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1262.56) | So for that use case, you could create like these abstract backgrounds.                                 |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1267.52) | Those were really popular a few years ago, like the ones with like different bursts of                  |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1272.06) | color that sort of blend in together.                                                                   |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1274.8)  | In 2015, I was sort of doing a lot of work around CSS filters and blend modes and using                 |
| [21:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1280.0)  | gradients as a layer of color to apply styles to images or other types of media.                        |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1286.44) | So you could, like you said, do a circle at top of like a wheat color to a lighter color                |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1293.96) | that's transparent or semi-transparent and then have that layer over like a tomato color                |
| [21:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1299.68) | linear gradient.                                                                                        |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1300.68) | And you could have a larger swath underneath that of like navy to red and see how all these             |

| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1309.96) | And that was like the coolest part of that for me.                                                      |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1312.92) | It's just really cool to see how they overlap and how you can just layer them.                          |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1317.88) | It's like a comma separated list of values.                                                             |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1319.92) | It's pretty cool.                                                                                       |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1320.92) | It's kind of like box shadows where you can have as many as you want and have them interact             |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1325.0)  | in a way.                                                                                               |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1326.0)  | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1327.0)  | And you could use them even to like draw.                                                               |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1328.0)  | So how people make the single div stuff, you could layer multiple background gradients                  |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1332.4)  | with gradient drawn assets and build things up with like these little Legos of gradient                 |
| [22:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1338.04) | entries.                                                                                                |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1339.04) | It's like really amazing work of people recreating like classic portraits using gradients and           |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1345.28) | other CSS properties to draw things out in shapes.                                                      |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1348.68) | It's like really, really cool to see that.                                                              |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1350.72) | Another great use case for gradients are things like subtle stripes or loading bars.                    |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1357.2)  | You can use the repeating linear gradient for that.                                                     |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1360.6)  | So if you wanted to have like a background on your website, you can use some muted colors               |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1365.82) | and create aesthetic effects that way so you could do like polka dots with repeated radial              |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1371.32) | gradients or you could do like thick stripes like you would find in like a baby's room                  |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1375.44) | sort of vibe on your website.                                                                           |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1377.8)  | And then I think a loading bar is a great example because you can use angles when creating              |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1383.16) | linear gradients.                                                                                       |
| [23:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1384.16) | So you would write something like repeating linear gradients like negative 45 degrees                   |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1389.24) | and then you could do light blue comma light blue 10px and then the next color would start              |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1395.6)  | so then you would have a comma and then say you have navy 10px.                                         |
| [23:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1399.52) | You want to start at the same point the last color ended and then you would set the size                |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1403.48) | that it's like comma navy 20px.                                                                         |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1405.98) | So these would each be 10 pixel stripes and you could animate that in with just showing                 |
| [23:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1411.98) | the spacing available.                                                                                  |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1413.92) | You could do a little hack by doing a scale x on like a white layer on top of that gradient             |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1420.36) | so it's more performant as it's moving.                                                                 |
| [23:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1422.4)  | It looks like your line is moving to the right but really the background is moving to the               |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1426.44) | left so you could do a bunch of things like that.                                                       |
| [23:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1428.6)  | You could also use content gradients for pie charts.                                                    |
| [23:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1430.88) | CSS custom properties are your friend here.                                                             |
| [23:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1433.28) | You can set values for your pie chart using custom properties by setting those start and                |
| [23:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1439.16) | stop points and you can pass this data from JavaScript hopefully soon from an attribute                 |
| [24:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1444.48) | value in HTML also to your custom properties and then you would set the stops for your                  |
| [24:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1450.28) | pie chart.                                                                                              |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1451.28) | You can also use negative values for gradient stops.                                                    |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1454.72) | This is something that I also use when layering gradients to create smoother effects to create          |
| [24:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1459.98) | more even transitions and to help with layering multiple gradients.                                     |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1464.46) | So you don't have to just stay within the box.                                                          |
| [24:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1466.38) | You could create outside of the box and of course your gradient will be clipped to the                  |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1471.68) | element itself and however using it whether using border radius or whether you're using                 |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1475.92) | different clip paths or just have a square or rectangle or oval or polygon.                             |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1481.72) | Yeah absolutely I just made a gradient loader bar the other day.                                        |

| [25:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1503.12) | It was a rainbow as an indeterminate loading state so it's just very colorful and bright                |

| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1521.36) | headache and avoid using the transparent keyword in your gradients.                                     |
| [25:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1524.96) | I think we've even covered this in a previous episode.                                                  |
| [25:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1527.6)  | You and I ran into this issue on a recent project we were on where we were transitioning                |
| [25:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1532.44) | a gradient from like let's say blue to transparent and we expected it just sort of blue to disappear    |
| [25:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1538.68) | but what we got would be blue to sort of bluish gray to disappear and the reason that that              |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1544.32) | was happening is because the spec has specified how interpolation is done between those two             |
| [25:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1549.56) | colors and anything that is showing up a little bit extra gray means it's not doing the math            |
| [25:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1554.96) | as specified by the spec which is in pre-multiplied RGBA and so it comes out a little bit muddy         |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1560.08) | so if you are seeing a muddier gray in your gradient or even if you just want to avoid                  |
| [26:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1565.24) | having this ever happen use functional color notation and just reduce the opacity yourself              |
| [26:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1571.76) | in the color so that it maintains the hue as it goes down to transparent because it                     |
| [26:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1576.32) | otherwise might be trying to cast to white or black and fading out towards a black or                   |
| [26:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1580.52) | a white transparent and it might not be a contextual transparent.                                       |
| [26:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1584.0)  | Anyway how do I recap on that tip you know did I say it well?                                           |
| [26:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1587.36) | Yeah and I think that the main thing here too is to browser test because different browsers             |
| [26:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1592.2)  | draw gradients differently so you'll have a gradient look as you expect in one browser                  |
| [26:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1598.04) | and not in another browser and this is where you really start to run into like some weird               |
| [26:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1603.36) | cross browser issues so just to be safe specify all of your colors use like an HSLA or RGBA             |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1610.78) | color to have that gradient transition properly as you would expect.                                    |
| [26:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1615.2)  | Nice yeah.                                                                                              |
| [26:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1616.2)  | Another tip is I am in love with transition hints so we covered those in that they can                  |
| [27:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1621.6)  | specify how like if you have two colors and neither of them have a stop or even if they                 |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1625.4)  | do have color stops it doesn't matter it's am I going smoothly like in a linear fashion                 |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1629.48) | from pink to purple or do you want me to be mostly pink and then ramp into purple kind                  |
| [27:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1634.44) | of quickly and the way that you can do that is with the transition hint you essentially                 |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1638.08) | are articulating like a cubic Bezier but in a single percentage value so instead of where               |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1643.76) | you do like a cubic Bezier where it's like hey start here and end here and then make                    |
| [27:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1647.48) | a curve between those it's more like you specify the center and it draws the curve for you              |
| [27:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1652.52) | so a transition hint like if I have linear gradient hot pink comma 25 percent comma purple              |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1660.12) | what I essentially am saying is I want you to be a curve that is more dominant in the                   |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1664.6)  | purple space so just have less pink but have more purple and you'd get this smooth interpolation        |
| [27:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1669.84) | and it's really really powerful and you can combine it with color stops and background                  |
| [27:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1674.78) | size and all these other things to really produce rich color interpolation that is reasonable           |
| [28:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1680.12) | in all these different ways so anyway transition hints if you haven't put one in your gradients         |
| [28:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1683.8)  | yet go do it it's also frustrating for me personally because transition hints aren't                    |
| [28:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1688.62) | in any single gradient tool that I've ever seen so if you know a gradient tool out in                   |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1694.1)  | the web world that empowers designers with transition hints tell me I'm interested and                  |
| [28:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1699.8)  | I want to see what it is and how it's working because I think that those are important and              |
| [28:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1703.76) | more people should be using them and my last tip is I was reading Leah Verou this is a                  |
| [28:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1709.0)  | Leah Verou special episode isn't it I mean she is awesome so you'll find a lot of her                   |
| [28:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1714.6)  | links in the show notes today but I was reading a blog post she made called cicada principle            |
| [28:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1719.92) | and it was a article about how to make your repeating elements or things like a gradient                |
| [28:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1725.44) | here because we talked about repeating gradients more organically random and the way that she           |
| [28:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1730.3)  | does this was with the cicada principle using prime numbers and so I just wanted to throw               |
| [28:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1735.04) | that out there and all these repeating scenarios you can create a repeating gradient that actually      |
| [28:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1739.24) | has some randomness to it and it's more organically random using the cicada principle the possibilities |
| [29:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1745.32) | of CSS are endless it's just it's so cool all right web I love you yeah I read that                     |
| [29:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1751.96) | article and I really liked it it's definitely interesting and it's more simple than you                 |
| [29:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1756.56) | think so that was pretty cool to read about but I hope that you liked our show on gradients             |

| [29:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1JugZhO82tJa8c1LFpR6il?&t=1776.08) | something from this show me too I'm gonna specify my gradients with rads from now on                    |
