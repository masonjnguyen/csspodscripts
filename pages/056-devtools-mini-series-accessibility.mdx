| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to Z index.              |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=18.06)  | This is episode three in our special design summer mini series all about dev tools and               |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=22.8)   | how you can use them to debug and help build your UIs.                                               |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=26.28)  | And to do that we have a special guest for this show our dev tool specialist Jesslyn                 |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=30.68)  | Yeen.                                                                                                |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=31.68)  | Today's show is all about accessibility features in dev tools so Jesslyn can you kick us off         |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=35.36)  | by talking a little bit about the accessibility panel in dev tools.                                  |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=39.6)   | Definitely you can access the accessibility pane via the elements panel.                             |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=44.52)  | There are four sections in the accessibility pane.                                                   |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=48.24)  | Let's start with the bottom most section the source order viewer.                                    |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=52.92)  | The newest CSS features allow us to create content that looks very different on its on-screen        |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=58.72)  | order than what is in in the HTML document.                                                          |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=63.24)  | This is a big accessibility problem because the screen reader users would get a different            |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=68.98)  | most likely confusing experience than sighted users.                                                 |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=73.34)  | To better inspect that enable the source order checkbox to view the order of source elements         |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=79.44)  | on screen.                                                                                           |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=80.98)  | Next is the computed properties section.                                                             |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=84.2)   | Think of it like the styles computed pane but it's for accessibility properties.                     |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=89.44)  | For example if you create a hyperlink, Chrome will set its role as link and set its focusable        |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=95.8)   | attribute to true by default.                                                                        |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=98.54)  | These properties will be shown here.                                                                 |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=101.04) | We can also set our area attributes say if you want to hide an element for screen reader             |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=108.4)  | we define an area hide attribute.                                                                    |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=111.72) | This attribute will be shown in the area attribute section.                                          |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=115.84) | Now let's talk about the accessibility tree section.                                                 |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=119.76) | The accessibility tree is a subset of the DOM tree.                                                  |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=123.26) | It only contains elements from the DOM tree that are relevant and useful for displaying              |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=128.52) | the pages contents in the screen reader.                                                             |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=132.34) | As a web developer we mostly use the area attributes to manipulate the accessibility tree.           |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=139.36) | When you select a DOM element the existing accessibility tree will display all its ancestors         |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=145.34) | and its immediate children.                                                                          |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=148.14) | This tree view is okay but it's quite limited because it's only allowed you to explore a             |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=154.2)  | single node and its ancestor.                                                                        |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=157.42) | Good news is we are now launching a full accessibility tree.                                         |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=161.8)  | This preview feature makes it easier for you to get an overview of the whole tree.                   |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=166.68) | To turn on that enable the full page accessibility tree checkbox.                                    |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=171.4)  | A new button is added in the elements panel.                                                         |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=174.88) | It's very obvious so you wouldn't miss that.                                                         |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=178.24) | Toggle it.                                                                                           |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=179.64) | Now instead of showing the DOM tree the elements panel now displays a full accessibility tree        |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=186.04) | for the page.                                                                                        |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=187.8)  | If I select the tree node it will highlight the elements on the page.                                |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=192.36) | Very nice.                                                                                           |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=193.36) | Yeah that is a cool one.                                                                             |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=194.96) | It's right above your elements in the elements panel like all the tree of you know DOM you           |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=200.68) | get that accessibility tree button and you push it and it's sort of you know you can                 |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=204.4)  | twirl it open and close things and inspect just like you were in your elements panel                 |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=208.6)  | but you're looking at the accessibility tree.                                                        |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=211.08) | I've been looking at the experiment for a few months and that is some cool stuff.                    |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=214.96) | Thanks for sharing that Jessalyn.                                                                    |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=215.96) | Yeah there's an article coming out soon that also goes over all of its features so look              |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=220.56) | out for that on developer.com.com.                                                                   |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=222.68) | Yeah takes all that guesswork out just shows it for you so you can just go see right at              |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=226.76) | the source.                                                                                          |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=227.92) | View the source.                                                                                     |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=228.92) | View the accessibility tree source.                                                                  |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=231.0)  | Cool I'm going to cover the CSS overview next which can show you contrast scores.                    |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=236.76) | So we've covered the CSS overview before but this is specifically how does it help accessibility     |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=241.56) | and it has a nice scoring system that you can go to.                                                 |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=244.2)  | So to check it out go straight to the CSS overview hit command shift P for the command               |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=248.52) | palette type CSS over and you'll see it auto complete with the show CSS overview option              |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=256.04) | and once you choose that underneath the background and text colors in your results so you need       |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=260.34) | to capture like you know have it scan your page you'll find a contrast issue section                 |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=266.24) | and here you'll see an overview of all your contrast scores discovered by dev tools things           |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=270.2)  | like buttons links headers paragraphs and whatever you'll see double a and AAA score                 |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=274.84) | results and it's really nice for a code review.                                                      |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=277.64) | Dev tools experiment though incoming so if you're into dev tools experiments head to                 |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=282.0)  | the settings then experiments and enable new advanced perceptual contrast algorithm APCA.            |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=287.92) | APCA intends to upgrade the math that's used by double a and AAA scoring algorithms to               |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=294.48) | include more human perceptual factors so it's not just a math contrast ratio this is in              |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=299.96) | including humans and the way that we see which also the results aren't confusing with two            |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=305.48) | scores you only have one score so in this new APCA there's one score to be worried about             |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=309.8)  | and you can try it out in dev tools today I just turn it on in those settings and it                 |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=313.8)  | will start to show up in things like the CSS overview.                                               |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=317.6)  | Yeah and also in the color picker that's another dev tools feature that gives you accessibility      |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=324.0)  | information.                                                                                         |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=325.0)  | Did you know that according to an analysis of the top 1 million websites over 86% of                 |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=330.32) | home pages have low contrast?                                                                        |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=333.16) | That's a lot that's a lot of home that's that's most that's bad we got to fix that.                  |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=337.56) | If you inspect text in dev tools that has a color and click on the box next to that                  |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=341.96) | color like a little box you'll see this panel pop up with the color picker and within that           |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=348.24) | there's a contrast ratio and accessibility contrast score for double a and AAA compliance            |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=352.82) | so that usually works if you're on a color you can pick the color out and there's a background       |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=356.92) | that's easily accessible to that element.                                                            |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=359.8)  | So the color picker also shows contrast lines for double a and AAA which helps you pick              |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=364.0)  | colors that are within appropriate contrast levels if the initial color value isn't.                 |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=369.4)  | So note that Adam did just mention the advanced perceptual contrast algorithm the APCA which         |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=374.52) | is replacing double a and AAA guidelines and it's also going to be replacing them in the             |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=379.44) | color picker for contrast ratio.                                                                     |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=381.6)  | APCA is just more context dependent the contrast is calculated based on the text's spatial           |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=387.0)  | properties so font weight and size come more into play color so perceived color perceived            |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=392.76) | lightness between text and background and then also context so there's ambient light                 |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=397.52) | and surroundings intended the intended purpose of the text.                                          |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=401.12) | So Canary has a beta feature Adam whenever I turn that on you have to turn it on from                |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=405.98) | settings experiments and this will enable the new APCA color contrast score to replace               |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=411.28) | the previous contrast ratios of double a and AAA.                                                    |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=414.36) | So it might be good to start getting familiar with that.                                             |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=416.68) | The last cool thing with the color picker is this auto setting tool that's right next                |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=421.56) | to your failing color so if you've inspected a color it doesn't have enough contrast there's         |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=425.76) | this little icon so square next to a non-passing score that you can click on and it'll automatically |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=432.4)  | adjust the color value to be the closest passing score value.                                        |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=436.32) | So it'll like move right up to the line and make sure that you're at least passing accessibility     |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=442.6)  | contrast scores but it kind of helps you pick the closest color to the one that you've intended      |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=447.28) | for that interface.                                                                                  |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=448.6)  | So I think that that's really cool you can kind of go through and like auto fix all of               |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=451.72) | your accessibility color contrast issues through dev tools.                                          |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=455.68) | Yep that's a very useful feature and did you know roughly one in 20 people suffer from               |

| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=464.76) | Such impairments make it harder to tell different color apart which can amplify contrast issues.     |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=471.4)  | You can use the emulate vision deficiency feature to get a better idea of how people                 |

| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=580.56) | Next I'm going to cover the Lighthouse accessibility audit.                                          |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=583.36) | So Lighthouse is a tool that you can run against your page.                                          |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=586.04) | It does a whole bunch of things that test the download speed of your page, the responsiveness        |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=590.66) | of your page.                                                                                        |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=591.66) | So it'll set it to a different viewport.                                                             |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=593.92) | It'll try with different connection speeds.                                                          |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=595.96) | It does all these different tests to kind of stress test your site and see how it's                  |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=599.74) | doing in these different environment impacts.                                                        |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=603.52) | With Lighthouse you can do an accessibility audit as part of it.                                     |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=606.22) | So when you run Lighthouse you'll get an accessibility audit.                                        |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=609.6)  | Go to Lighthouse pane and click the generate report button and this will run all the scripts         |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=613.4)  | and do all the tests.                                                                                |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=615.04) | Once it's done you can click the accessibility score that you got and it will automatically          |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=618.74) | scroll you down.                                                                                     |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=620.28) | You'll get a score from anywhere from 0 to 100.                                                      |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=622.6)  | When you click and go down to the section you'll see all the checks that it did.                     |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=626.72) | So what did it check on your site and how did you do?                                                |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=629.92) | These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your app.                       |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=633.12) | So these are just really good things to know about if you're learning or they're good to             |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=637.4)  | know in case you're just building something and need to go verify that everything's going            |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=641.0)  | to work as you expect.                                                                               |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=642.0)  | This will include things like ARIA attributes that are valid or invalid, names and labels            |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=646.52) | to improve the semantics for controls in your app for screen readers or other technologies.          |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=650.16) | Like it checks buttons for accessible names.                                                         |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=652.4)  | It checks forms and matching labels.                                                                 |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=654.4)  | It looks for legible links and links that have good text in them.                                    |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=657.98) | It also does contrast checks to help improve legibility of your content.                             |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=661.32) | It looks at heading order and navigation.                                                            |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=663.76) | And just a quick note, this is not a replacement for manual testing.                                 |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=667.36) | And in fact it offers a set of manual things to try at the very end.                                 |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=671.26) | So if you are reviewing all of these items that it's testing in your audit you'll find               |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=675.68) | a bunch of things to do by hand at the end.                                                          |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=678.12) | And this is things like logical tab order, making sure that things have keyboard focus               |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=683.0)  | if they're supposed to.                                                                              |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=684.92) | Elements indicate their purpose and state.                                                           |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=686.76) | So if a user is non-sighted they can't just see the state of a button.                               |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=691.94) | The button needs to have that state indicated on it so that a screen reader can inform the           |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=696.52) | user that this is in fact in a different state.                                                      |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=699.98) | Make sure that you have no focus traps because then the user can't navigate your page from           |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=703.56) | a keyboard.                                                                                          |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=705.32) | So these are all again manual things to try.                                                         |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=707.12) | And then you have off-screen content.                                                                |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=708.56) | Make sure that's hidden from screen readers.                                                         |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=710.3)  | There's all sorts of cool stuff at the bottom of that Lighthouse accessibility audit.                |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=713.28) | So get that a check.                                                                                 |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=714.48) | There's also a Canary beta experiment that enables an automatic low contrast reporting               |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=719.8)  | in the issues tab.                                                                                   |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=720.92) | So this is another beta feature in Canary.                                                           |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=723.24) | If you turn this feature on when you open a new webpage and it has low contrast text                 |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=727.56) | these contrast warnings will automatically appear in your dev tools console instead of               |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=731.6)  | you needing to go and seek them out.                                                                 |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=732.92) | They'll come to you.                                                                                 |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=733.92) | So it's a way of bringing these issues to the forefront and make sure that you're always             |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=736.68) | designing an accessible experience.                                                                  |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=738.96) | So to enable the experiment check the enable automatic contrast issue reporting via the              |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=744.84) | issues panel checkbox under settings and experiments.                                                |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=748.36) | So all these experiments, the additional format, the APCA and this automatic contrast checking,      |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=756.26) | those are all going to be under settings and under experiments.                                      |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2orzml5RcWYVgUDLkVgwnQ?&t=758.92) | So definitely check those out.                                                                       |
