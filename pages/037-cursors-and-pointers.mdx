| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=18.26)   | Today we're talking about cursors and pointers and pointer events and pointer media queries,       |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=24.16)   | basically all the ways to interact with your mouse and a touch input device, whether that's        |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=28.68)   | a stylus or a finger or a mouse or potato.                                                         |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=36.32)   | What potatoes also work on your phone.                                                             |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=39.52)   | So I mean, theoretically, or even just as a fact, they are pointers like fingerling                |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=45.44)   | or like all potatoes.                                                                              |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=46.44)   | Like, is there like a specific brand or type?                                                      |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=49.72)   | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=50.72)   | I was watching this video a couple weeks ago.                                                      |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=52.0)    | This this guy sings this song is like potato works on my iPhone.                                   |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=55.8)    | Why?                                                                                               |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=56.8)    | He does this awesome funk song all about it.                                                       |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=58.6)    | So anyway, sorry, being weird.                                                                     |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=60.6)    | You're going to have to share that link in the show notes.                                         |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=63.96)   | Pointer devices are input device representations, and there are a few ways to interact with        |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=67.64)   | them in CSS.                                                                                       |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=68.76)   | And apparently one of those options is a potato.                                                   |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=70.6)    | A potato.                                                                                          |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=71.6)    | Yeah, we'll have to just share a tweet.                                                            |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=73.0)    | Maybe that's when we share this episode.                                                           |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=74.2)    | We'll be like, use a potato and listen to this episode.                                            |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=77.36)   | I need to try that for myself first.                                                               |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=78.8)    | I need some data.                                                                                  |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=79.8)    | Well, now I'm just getting hungry.                                                                 |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=80.92)   | I want some potatoes.                                                                              |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=81.92)   | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=82.92)   | Anyway, the first one is pointer events.                                                           |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=85.76)   | And this property allows you to control HTML elements and how they respond to mouse and            |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=90.64)   | touch events.                                                                                      |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=91.64)   | Like, do they even fire or not?                                                                    |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=93.4)    | And there's a whole bunch more values for SVG.                                                     |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=96.36)   | So SVG gets really nice exceptions in here.                                                        |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=98.96)   | But at a high level, this is sort of telling an element whether or not it should get hover         |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=103.32)  | states, or even click events or active states.                                                     |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=107.76)  | So the values it accepts are none, which would mean you sort of make this thing decorative         |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=112.24)  | and it can't get any events.                                                                       |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=114.08)  | You can set it to auto, which is what it is by default.                                            |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=117.32)  | But sometimes you have to set it again, like if a parent was set to none.                          |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=120.12)  | So you can set it to none on a parent and then opt into it specifically on a child and             |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=124.08)  | really hone in that hit area of something.                                                         |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=126.68)  | Or you can set the value to inherit.                                                               |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=129.0)   | And just a fun note about this, this will prevent click events from firing in JavaScript           |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=133.16)  | too.                                                                                               |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=134.16)  | So if you set pointer events none on something, it's not going to send any events.                 |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=136.84)  | Yeah, that's good.                                                                                 |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=137.92)  | So definitely make sure that you're only using pointer events none on decorative elements          |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=141.2)   | that don't need to have an interaction with the user.                                              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=145.64)  | This is something that I would actually do when I used layers for filters on images.               |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=150.16)  | It was a decorative element.                                                                       |
| [02:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=151.64)  | If I wanted the user to be able to interact with an image or something behind that element,        |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=155.72)  | I would set pointer events none.                                                                   |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=157.32)  | I feel like I've actually used this a few times.                                                   |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=159.36)  | I've used pointer events none all the time.                                                        |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=161.56)  | Yeah, it becomes really common, especially if you have a gradient overlay on something             |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=165.6)   | that has links.                                                                                    |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=166.6)   | Yeah, anytime you're stacking or creating overlays, you might get into a hit area issue.           |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=171.4)   | And this lets you hone it in so that potatoes can send a tweet.                                    |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=176.6)   | Or if you have it overlapping some text and has like a blend mode applied and the text             |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=181.28)  | is visibly legible, but it's not because of that element hovering, not hovering, layered           |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=186.52)  | on top of it, then you got to set the pointer events.                                              |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=189.12)  | It's like the glass.                                                                               |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=190.36)  | It's like a piece of glass and it's consuming all the events.                                      |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=193.52)  | And what you can set it to is none.                                                                |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=195.2)   | That's why SVG has more powers here because SVG has all these different painted shapes             |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=199.16)  | and you can specify which painted shapes actually get touch events.                                |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=203.88)  | So anyway, kind of cool.                                                                           |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=205.24)  | Yeah, and hit areas.                                                                               |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=206.52)  | Okay, so there's also media queries that you can see what type of pointers are available           |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=213.0)   | for your device.                                                                                   |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=214.0)   | So this media query is any pointer and it tests whether or not the device has any pointing         |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=219.08)  | device like a mouse, finger or potato and how accurate that device is.                             |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=225.68)  | So one option is at media, any pointer, none.                                                      |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=229.02)  | This means that there's no pointer device available, which is one way to make sure that            |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=233.32)  | you're styling for that.                                                                           |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=235.3)   | Another is at media, any pointer, fine.                                                            |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=237.4)   | That means that you have a pointer device available and it's fine pointing like a mouse            |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=242.0)   | or stylus or a trackpad or something.                                                              |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=245.48)  | So you are able to have very refined touch inputs.                                                 |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=250.52)  | And there's also any pointer course.                                                               |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=252.52)  | So this is for course pointing like a finger on a touch screen or I guess a potato on a            |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=260.08)  | touch screen.                                                                                      |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=261.08)  | So that's any pointer course.                                                                      |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=263.0)   | And so for something that has any pointer course, you might want to make things like               |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=266.4)   | form elements or action buttons, any user interaction icon or element.                             |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=272.16)  | You might want to make those bigger for the course pointer devices.                                |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=276.06)  | So maybe something like a checkbox.                                                                |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=278.12)  | And this media query is supported in all modern browsers so you can start styling things to        |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=282.68)  | work with the type of pointer.                                                                     |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=284.16)  | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=285.16)  | I love those ones.                                                                                 |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=286.16)  | You can combine them too and refine your spacing and all sorts of stuff.                           |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=289.92)  | This is super handy to know that the pointer type media queries are there and excellent            |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=294.8)   | breakdown.                                                                                         |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=296.32)  | This next section is called cursor types.                                                          |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=298.64)  | And so we can use CSS to change the style of the cursor.                                           |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=302.28)  | You might not know that if you were born yesterday, but if you were born more than 10 years ago,   |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=306.56)  | you've seen some pretty fun cursors like magic wands, flaming potatoes, maybe there's all          |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=312.72)  | sorts of stuff that you can stick and attach to that mouse.                                        |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=315.96)  | And we're going to go through some of these.                                                       |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=317.46)  | So there's some that are built into the browser that can become handy for like the grab hand       |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=322.08)  | and the sort of like changing positions.                                                           |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=324.64)  | And so there's like some built-in ones you've seen before or the dreaded one, the waiting          |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=328.12)  | one, just the little spinner.                                                                      |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=329.68)  | You're just like, I hate that cursor type.                                                         |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=332.88)  | But then there's really fun ones that you can deliver animated ones that are a file                |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=336.2)   | and point to a URL.                                                                                |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=337.44)  | So you know, you want to kick us off with a few of those?                                          |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=340.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=341.64)  | So the first value that is the default for the cursor property is auto and this lets               |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=347.22)  | the user agent determine the cursor to use based on the context.                                   |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=351.92)  | So that lets the browser decide for you, you are not cursor jacking.                               |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=355.12)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=356.12)  | The next value is default and this is the platform dependent default cursor.                       |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=361.6)   | Typically like the white arrow.                                                                    |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=363.24)  | Then there's none, which means that you want no cursor rendered.                                   |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=366.2)   | So that can be kind of jarring or you can use this in combination with some other effects.         |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=370.88)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=371.88)  | The next one is context menu and it shows like this little piece of paper next to the              |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=375.28)  | cursor to indicate that there's a right click option.                                              |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=378.54)  | Then there's help, which looks like a little question mark.                                        |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=381.96)  | It might have a little pointer icon next to it or not.                                             |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=385.82)  | And I've used this when I have like a little like more info section with maybe like a tool         |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=392.2)   | to pop out.                                                                                        |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=393.2)   | I use like the help cursor.                                                                        |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=394.76)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=395.76)  | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=396.76)  | Good call.                                                                                         |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=397.76)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=398.76)  | Anytime you have a check mark icon of some kind, this would be really well positioned              |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=400.42)  | on there.                                                                                          |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=401.48)  | The next one is pointer.                                                                           |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=402.48)  | So we can set cursor pointer and that gives the little hand with the index finger pointing         |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=406.96)  | up.                                                                                                |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=407.96)  | It's typically used for like putting on a link or something and it looks like an image             |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=411.88)  | of a pointing head.                                                                                |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=412.88)  | So it's kind of like it's pointing.                                                                |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=413.88)  | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=414.88)  | Yeah, I actually use one a lot because if I'm using a CSS reset on buttons, it'll like             |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=418.96)  | remove the pointer sometimes.                                                                      |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=420.74)  | So I have to add that back and make sure that there's a visual interactive element there.          |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=426.36)  | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=427.36)  | And there's progress, which is sometimes animated.                                                 |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=432.04)  | And this shows that the program is busy.                                                           |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=434.48)  | So you're waiting, but there is progress happening.                                                |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=437.68)  | It's kind of like a spinning circle or like one of those sand, what is it?                         |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=446.08)  | Hourglass.                                                                                         |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=447.08)  | Hourglass.                                                                                         |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=448.08)  | That's it.                                                                                         |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=449.08)  | Sand towers.                                                                                       |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=450.08)  | Sand towers.                                                                                       |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=451.08)  | So good.                                                                                           |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=452.08)  | The next one is wait, which is just the hourglass or the spinning beach ball of death or whatever. |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=461.04)  | The progress had an arrow and wait does not.                                                       |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=464.2)   | And they're pretty similar.                                                                        |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=465.5)   | Like on my iOS device, they're identical on my Mac.                                                |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=470.56)  | So the next one is cell.                                                                           |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=472.28)  | And this one indicates the table cell or a set of cells that you can select.                       |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=477.56)  | And it looks like a little plus, like a little cross.                                              |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=480.16)  | And I actually like to use this when I'm building a UI where you can add a section and then        |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=486.12)  | fill out that section because it's kind of like a, okay, plus like added section.                  |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=489.84)  | Totally.                                                                                           |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=490.84)  | It's nice.                                                                                         |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=491.84)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=492.84)  | Next one is crosshair.                                                                             |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=493.84)  | This is a really thin plus.                                                                        |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=495.64)  | And I've used this one in VisBug when you're using the guides tool.                                |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=498.48)  | I change your cursor to a plus to help you indicate it's a crosshair.                              |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=502.52)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=503.52)  | So then we have text and this indicates that text can be selected.                                 |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=508.0)   | And that is the vertical sort of like eye tool with the serifs at the end.                         |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=513.64)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=514.64)  | And then there's vertical text, which is the same icon, but twisted sideways so that you           |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=518.2)   | can select vertical text.                                                                          |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=519.9)   | Then we have drag and drop icons.                                                                  |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=523.4)   | And the first one is alias.                                                                        |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=524.68)  | So this is like a little arrow that points up into the right that has a narrowed tail.             |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=532.36)  | And the arrow bit is the thick triangle.                                                           |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=534.52)  | And this indicates that you have an alias or shortcut.                                             |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=538.2)   | Awesome.                                                                                           |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=539.2)   | That is created.                                                                                   |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=540.64)  | The next one is copy.                                                                              |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=541.78)  | So this is cursor copy and it puts a nice green plus next to the arrow.                            |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=545.92)  | Then we have move, which looks like the cross section, like a plus, but with all of the            |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=552.4)   | ends of the plus sign as arrows.                                                                   |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=555.08)  | And so it's like a double-sided arrow that's intersected vertically and horizontally.              |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=560.84)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=561.84)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=562.84)  | Move in all directions.                                                                            |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=563.84)  | The next one is no drop, which just puts a sort of cancel sign or like a no action sign            |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=569.76)  | with your cursor.                                                                                  |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=571.04)  | And there's also not allowed, which is similar to no drop on my Mac computer.                      |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=575.48)  | It is the exact same icon.                                                                         |
| [09:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=577.74)  | I think on Microsoft it is slightly different.                                                     |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=580.58)  | The next one I use all the time in my interfaces with JavaScript, which is grab and grabbing.      |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=585.88)  | So this is the hand sort of, reminds me of Mario 64.                                               |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=589.6)   | Anyway, it's like just a floating white glove, essentially.                                        |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=593.6)   | It's almost like Mickey Mouse's hand.                                                              |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=595.7)   | And then grabbing has the fingers clasped as if it's grabbed something.                            |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=599.96)  | And yeah, JavaScript, I'll do this.                                                                |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=601.08)  | So it's like on hover, I'll show the grab and then on touch starter, mouse down, I'll              |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=606.16)  | be grabbing and just kind of orchestrate this nice cursor feedback.                                |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=610.76)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=612.12)  | Then there's also all scroll, which is very similar to move.                                       |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=615.28)  | It looks almost identical, but this is a part of resizing and scrolling.                           |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=619.56)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=620.56)  | Next one after that is column resize, which has the sort of like a pipe in the center              |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=625.06)  | and then two arrows left and right.                                                                |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=627.16)  | And then there's row resize, which is the pipe in the center and arrows up and down.               |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=634.04)  | And this is nice because like if you're using a text editor or something, you're often resizing    |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=638.92)  | windows, and this indicates which direction you're resizing them.                                  |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=642.56)  | Definitely.                                                                                        |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=643.56)  | The next one is a whole bunch of resizes, and I'm just going to kind of sum them up                |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=647.72)  | here because they're representing coordinates of like Northeast, Southwest.                        |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=651.68)  | So the first one is n-resize and that's North resize and it's an arrow pointing up and it's        |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=656.56)  | got East resize, South resize.                                                                     |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=658.04)  | So it's like pointing to the right, pointing down, but then you can also combine them.             |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=661.32)  | So you have like Northeast resize and that'll point to the upper right corner.                     |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=665.32)  | And then you have East and West resize, which are left and right, and in North and South           |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=669.48)  | resize.                                                                                            |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=670.48)  | I use these often when I'm creating interfaces that can be dragged and resized, or you'll          |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=673.58)  | notice on the resize CSS style that you get this for free in the corner that you interact          |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=678.36)  | with.                                                                                              |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=679.36)  | It'll change your cursor to kind of help you understand which direction you can pull the           |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=682.76)  | corner towards.                                                                                    |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=683.76)  | Yeah, a lot of these are defined in the user agent style, so that's where you would use            |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=687.04)  | the auto or not have to set a value.                                                               |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=689.48)  | It's just automatic by default.                                                                    |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=691.22)  | But if you were building a UI, especially something that has interaction built in, you             |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=696.44)  | might want to specify some of these cursor types to help your user have some feedback              |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=701.24)  | onto how they are supposed to interact with that new user interface that you're building.          |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=705.5)   | So finally, there's zooming.                                                                       |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=706.8)   | There's zoom in and zoom out.                                                                      |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=708.34)  | And then zoom in is a magnifying glass.                                                            |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=710.12)  | They plus the middle, zoom out is the magnifying glass with the minus in the middle.               |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=715.16)  | And this just indicates if something can be magnified in or out.                                   |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=718.84)  | An example of this would be if you're doing some online shopping, they often will have             |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=723.92)  | images that you can kind of like zoom into or zoom out of to get a better idea for the             |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=728.16)  | area.                                                                                              |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=729.16)  | And I also feel like with this movement, the drag and drop and the resizing for virtual            |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=734.88)  | tours on like virtual tours of houses.                                                             |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=737.36)  | Oh, nice.                                                                                          |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=738.36)  | You're like moving around in this virtual space using that all scroll or the move cursor.          |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=744.2)   | Good call.                                                                                         |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=745.24)  | So those are all the cursor types that are built into the browser.                                 |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=747.64)  | I think getting familiar with them can make a really nice touch in your interface.                 |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=751.4)   | It just shows that that layer of polish that added.                                                |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=754.52)  | It's just so nice.                                                                                 |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=756.24)  | It's like a little cherry on top.                                                                  |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=757.9)   | But you can also pass a URL and specify a custom one.                                              |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=762.14)  | And there is a site that Yuna shared that takes me back to 1995 and brings me so much              |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=767.92)  | joy.                                                                                               |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=768.92)  | Do you want to describe some of these in here?                                                     |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=770.4)   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=771.4)   | So custom cursors are definitely something that used to be a lot more popular on the               |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=776.52)  | web as people made like web blogs and customized their like Neopets pet pages and their like       |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=784.52)  | fan sites and things like that.                                                                    |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=787.26)  | But basically, you can specify any image, including animated GIFs.                                 |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=792.36)  | Animated GIFs are like some of the most popular.                                                   |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=794.72)  | And these images could be your cursor.                                                             |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=798.32)  | So if none of those other cursors that come with a user agent are enough, you can create           |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=803.48)  | your own.                                                                                          |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=804.48)  | So this site, it just is such an exemplar of old school, like nostalgic cursors.                   |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=812.24)  | And it's called cursors dash for you.                                                              |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=814.88)  | And it's like the number four and the letter U. So cursors spelled out dash, the number            |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=820.36)  | four letter U. And this just shows an example of where you could write some style to use           |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=826.92)  | this cursor and the site hosts them.                                                               |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=829.7)   | So you're going to put like cursor in your CSS and then colon and then this URL and then           |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=835.56)  | the position.                                                                                      |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=836.56)  | So you could do the X and Y position of the cursor, how far away it is from the pointer.           |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=842.44)  | So it could kind of be like in the center or on the side if you have like a little arrow           |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=846.12)  | pointing to it, which a lot of these do.                                                           |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=847.96)  | But they're so fun.                                                                                |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=849.08)  | I remember like the trailing rainbow star cursors were super fun.                                  |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=854.64)  | There's like, there's so many types here.                                                          |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=857.56)  | There's even new ones that are created.                                                            |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=860.28)  | There's a bunch of like mask cursors.                                                              |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0A6JQDnxwTG9wRaSz2rCEU?&t=864.8)   | There was, what was that really popular game that you can play where you kill people and           |
