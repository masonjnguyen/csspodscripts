| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.                 |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=16.84)  | Today we're covering containment and specifically talking about the CSS contain property.                |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=23.44)  | Containment is a really interesting but tricky topic.                                                    |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=26.24)  | It can really give you some great performance benefits as it provides a lot of control,                  |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=30.76)  | but because of that, there's a lot of nuance to containment.                                             |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=33.76)  | And it's important to understand how the browser will handle contained elements.                         |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=38.6)   | A lot of the content we're talking about in this episode is really well covered on MDN2,                 |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=43.68)  | which is the Mozilla documentation.                                                                      |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=47.74)  | So definitely check that out and shout out to the contributors of that.                                  |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=50.92)  | It helps make this also more clear for us.                                                               |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=53.64)  | Nice shout.                                                                                              |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=54.64)  | They deserve that.                                                                                       |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=55.74)  | Containment is a way to tell a browser that content can be isolated in a subtree of the                  |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=59.92)  | page, like away from the rest of the content.                                                            |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=61.88)  | You can think of it like a new render zone.                                                              |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=64.92)  | This feature is supported on all major browsers, modern ones, with a few different combinable            |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=69.76)  | ways to contain elements.                                                                                |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=71.58)  | We have layout, paint, size, and style.                                                                  |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=76.92)  | So let's start with the layout containment.                                                              |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=81.64)  | So when you do layout containment, you do contain layout, and applying layout containment                |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=86.96)  | tells the browser that everything this element needs to apply layout is scoped within the                |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=92.76)  | element itself.                                                                                          |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=94.16)  | So instead of looking outside of that element and the rest of the page for things that might             |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=98.74)  | affect this layout, we can skip that work and ignore outside layout.                                     |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=103.76) | This establishes an independent formatting context.                                                      |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=107.24) | So that means that margins won't collapse with the sibling element.                                      |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=111.68) | So if you listen to our episode about margins, margin collapse, we talk about how that sort              |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=117.18) | of works in the DOM.                                                                                     |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=118.88) | Here margins won't collapse.                                                                             |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=120.74) | Also float layout is performed independently of the rest of the page.                                    |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=125.08) | And the element that gets containment will be the containing block for fixed and absolutely              |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=130.42) | positioned elements.                                                                                     |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=131.76) | You're creating the subtree for the layout.                                                              |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=134.5)  | This also means that you can use Z and X because we've created a new stacking context when               |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=138.56) | you have containment applied.                                                                            |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=140.2)  | So a bunch of things, you apply containment, and with layout containment, it contains the                |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=145.24) | layout of that element.                                                                                  |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=146.76) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=147.76) | For some reason, I get this visual of like, I took a branch off of a tree, and then I                    |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=154.08) | heal its roots, and then I set it down on a new place, and I'm all firm.                                 |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=157.92) | And I'm like, here's your new place.                                                                     |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=159.12) | I'm containing you here.                                                                                 |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=160.8)  | You're still part of the old tree kind of.                                                               |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=162.72) | You're isolated and you're unique.                                                                       |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=165.72) | And now you're your own block formatting context.                                                        |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=168.64) | And I sort of like give it all these new promotions, and it hardens it up and makes it stronger.         |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=173.36) | Now it's on its own.                                                                                     |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=174.36) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=175.36) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=176.36) | I mean, this is creating a new tree.                                                                     |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=179.04) | So it's taking a piece of the UI, separating it into its own segment, and saying, at least               |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=187.12) | for the layout containment, don't worry about the other layout.                                          |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=191.16) | This is all self-contained.                                                                              |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=192.16) | Start applying layout from this specific segment.                                                        |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=195.52) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=196.52) | That makes sense why there's like speed benefits and stuff too, because, well, you were working          |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=200.96) | on one humongous tree.                                                                                   |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=202.2)  | Now you could have like a couple smaller parts that allow you to much easier compute on them             |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=206.04) | and stuff.                                                                                               |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=207.04) | Awesome.                                                                                                 |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=208.04) | Okay, cool.                                                                                              |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=209.04) | Nice explanation.                                                                                        |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=210.04) | Sorry for the metaphor.                                                                                  |

| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=213.04) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=214.04) | I can't help it sometimes.                                                                               |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=215.4)  | Must pacify metaphors one day.                                                                           |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=217.68) | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=218.68) | So let's talk about paint.                                                                               |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=219.68) | So that was layout containment.                                                                          |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=220.68) | Let's talk about paint containment.                                                                      |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=222.68) | So this is if you say contain colon paint.                                                               |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=225.36) | And with paint containment, the same general principles are true as they are for layout.                 |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=229.24) | Like the element doesn't rely on any context outside of itself to apply paint.                           |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=232.68) | But this also clips the box to the padding box of the contained element, and you won't                   |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=236.8)  | have any visible overflow.                                                                               |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=238.96) | With paint containment, you can get some performance benefits because you can prevent painting           |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=242.46) | until an element enters the screen.                                                                      |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=245.1)  | And we'll get to more in that in a bit.                                                                  |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=246.36) | But like you could lock repaints to the container, for example.                                          |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=249.88) | Next we have the size containment.                                                                       |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=251.56) | So this is contain size.                                                                                 |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=253.36) | Size containment is interesting because it essentially means that the size of the element's              |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=257.08) | children don't affect the size of the element itself.                                                    |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=260.64) | So it's computed like it has no children.                                                                |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=263.04) | So it basically gets like a height of zero.                                                              |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=265.92) | And this is usually used in combination with other contained properties to get the maximum               |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=269.8)  | performance benefits.                                                                                    |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=271.36) | And it can be used in conjunction with another property, contain intrinsic size, to set the              |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=276.48) | size of that element, but not worry about its children and calculating its children's                    |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=282.0)  | sizes and prevent scroll bar jumping.                                                                    |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=284.2)  | So this gives you a performance boost because you're setting the size before you calculate               |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=288.2)  | the children's size and ignoring the children's size.                                                    |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=291.68) | And this is used in conjunction with another property we'll talk about in a minute, which                |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=295.88) | is content visibility.                                                                                   |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=299.2)  | And yeah, the contain size is interesting because of that.                                               |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=303.76) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=304.76) | I see the pieces coming together now.                                                                    |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=307.2)  | Okay, interesting.                                                                                       |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=308.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=309.2)  | So since it's height of zero, then you have to sort of undo a little bit of that.                        |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=312.44) | So you're like, you've got a huge performance gain, but now you need to go like teach it                 |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=315.16) | a little bit more about this.                                                                            |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=316.16) | Like, eh, it's not quite zero, sorry.                                                                    |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=318.0)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=319.0)  | So you don't have like that scroll bar jumping when it does load in.                                     |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=321.2)  | Interesting.                                                                                             |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=322.2)  | Okay, cool.                                                                                              |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=323.2)  | So now we have style containment.                                                                        |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=324.2)  | So this is contain colon style.                                                                          |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=326.12) | Style containment gives you scope styles like you might get with something like web components           |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=329.32) | to leverage the shadow DOM.                                                                              |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=331.12) | And like a use case for style containment is to prevent something like CSS counters                      |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=335.28) | from leaking out of a specific tree.                                                                     |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=337.84) | This would prevent any counter increment or counter set to only be scoped to the style                   |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=341.88) | tree that contains the element.                                                                          |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=344.0)  | This is the only type of containment that's not fully supported in modern browsers, Firefox,             |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=348.28) | and is at risk in the spec.                                                                              |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=350.32) | Next we have some special values that you can use that combine some of these types of                    |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=353.76) | containment.                                                                                             |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=354.82) | So just to reiterate, the types of containment are layout, paint, size, and style.                       |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=359.68) | And you can also do contains content.                                                                    |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=362.72) | And this is the same as writing contain layout paint.                                                    |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=365.74) | So any of these values can be combined with a space separated list.                                      |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=369.42) | But you have these two special values that let you sort of do a shorthand.                               |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=374.28) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=375.28) | So then there's also strict.                                                                             |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=376.28) | So contain strict is the same as contain size, layout, and paint.                                        |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=380.24) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=381.24) | And you can write something like contain strict style.                                                   |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=383.16) | And that's another like shorthand to just contain everything instead of writing contain                  |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=387.24) | layout paint style size.                                                                                 |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=389.24) | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=390.24) | Those are all of them.                                                                                   |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=392.56) | So there's also something called inline containment.                                                     |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=395.78) | And this would be contain inline size.                                                                   |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=398.08) | This one is available behind a flag in Canary that ships with container queries.                         |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=402.32) | And it enables you to set size containment only on the inline axis of an element.                        |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=407.08) | So this prevents it from collapsing to a zero height because you're not doing containment                |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=411.4)  | on all of the size.                                                                                      |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=412.72) | So that would be all the children.                                                                       |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=414.2)  | It's only on the inline size.                                                                            |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=416.18) | And that's what also enables the at container property to work for container queries because             |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=420.44) | we're now isolating a contained parent element and telling the browser to query that inline              |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=424.68) | size.                                                                                                    |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=425.68) | So that's kind of how containment as a concept enables at container and container queries                |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=431.78) | to become possible.                                                                                      |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=432.78) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=433.78) | So it has.                                                                                               |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=434.78) | It's detached itself from the main tree.                                                                 |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=437.12) | It's isolated itself.                                                                                    |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=438.7)  | It's hardened its roots and given itself a sort of strong foundation, almost like it's                   |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=442.78) | a new HTML document.                                                                                     |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=444.72) | And then through these various properties, we can inform more about this element so that                 |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=450.28) | it can be more optimally rendered.                                                                       |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=452.0)  | Wow, this stuff is pretty intense.                                                                       |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=454.44) | Okay, let's talk about content visibility.                                                               |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=457.58) | So this is a property that works in conjunction with containment to decide whether or not                |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=461.24) | to render an element's contents.                                                                         |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=463.4)  | It's got some neat features and performance wins.                                                        |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=466.34) | So some values that it takes are visible.                                                                |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=468.84) | So content visibility visible and not just renders content as normal.                                    |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=472.96) | There's content visibility hidden that skips rendering for an element's content.                         |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=476.8)  | And there's content visibility auto.                                                                     |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=479.22) | And this skips rendering for an element's content until it's needed, like it's about                     |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=484.08) | to enter the vport, almost like a lazy load for your content.                                            |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=488.0)  | This one's really cool because it's where you see immediate performance benefits, which                  |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=491.82) | is like one line of CSS.                                                                                 |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=493.22) | If you have a really long HTML document and you just say, well, hey, if it's super duper                 |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=499.28) | long, you're like, well, hide half of it.                                                                |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=500.74) | You don't need to paint the whole scroll just if I'm going to scroll the top 10%.                        |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=505.66) | That's kind of what you're giving here some tips.                                                        |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=509.06) | So the element will get layout style and paint containment when its contents are off screen.             |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=513.54) | And it also gets size containment.                                                                       |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=515.08) | So basically, if the element is off screen, its descendants aren't rendered.                             |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=518.76) | The browser determines the size of the element without considering any of its contents.                  |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=522.7)  | And it just stops there.                                                                                 |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=523.7)  | It's just like, okay, well, here, I've been given a hint that I don't need to finish this                |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=527.18) | work.                                                                                                    |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=528.18) | As the element approaches the viewport, the browser no longer adds the size containment                  |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=531.58) | and starts painting and hit testing the element's content.                                               |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=535.02) | And this enables the rendering work to be done just in time as it's being seen by the                    |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=539.3)  | user.                                                                                                    |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=540.3)  | Another cool thing about content visibility auto is that the DOM content is still in the                 |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=545.34) | document.                                                                                                |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=546.34) | So it's searchable and it's accessible.                                                                  |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=548.26) | And that is unlike something like a virtual scroller, which would need to wait for that                  |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=552.22) | content to be loaded before it's available to the DOM and to screen readers and to searching             |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=556.68) | and all those things.                                                                                    |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=557.68) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=558.68) | But with this content visibility property, the content is still there.                                   |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=562.18) | It's just not getting the size and the other types of things that containment is being                   |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=569.82) | applied to, to prevent from rendering into the page until it's ready to enter the page.                  |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=576.86) | So another thing to consider for content visibility auto is something that we mentioned earlier          |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=581.62) | is that as your content removes the size containment, it now will calculate its actual size based        |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=586.98) | on the children elements.                                                                                |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=588.9)  | And that will cause the scroll bar to resize and make room for that new content.                         |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=593.42) | And you can avoid the drastic scroll bar jumps with the contain intrinsic size property.                 |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=598.52) | This property lets you set an estimated size for the elements that you're applying content               |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=602.42) | visibility to.                                                                                           |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=603.42) | And it's the best practice when you're using something like content visibility auto to                   |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=606.94) | chunk your content into sections that contain potentially several elements and give that                 |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=612.02) | an intrinsic size and then give that a content visibility auto.                                          |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=616.42) | Because when you do that, you can get some really serious performance gains, especially                  |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=620.54) | if that content has various layout applied to it, like you would with an article.                        |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=624.78) | Maybe you have like floated elements and like some content and other pieces here and there.              |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=631.58) | So you could see how just avoiding that rendering work can give you some really nice, just instantaneous |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=636.9)  | boosts when you're loading content on the page and then have it be ready and searchable                  |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=641.46) | for when it's going to enter the page.                                                                   |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=643.34) | This is super cool.                                                                                      |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=644.34) | This is like chunk appending, so it's like the browser is going to load and not do the                   |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=649.74) | whole page, which it usually does.                                                                       |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=651.74) | It's like an alternative to a virtual scroller that you can write with HTML and CSS.                     |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=657.1)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=658.1)  | It's like you take this huge static document and you virtualize pieces of it for free and                |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=662.62) | you're like, well, if they're not going to scroll to it, don't worry about it.                           |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=665.06) | And as they get close to it, start to worry about it.                                                    |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=667.34) | Cool.                                                                                                    |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=668.34) | I think, yeah, I think this like chunk appended draw only makes sense because yeah, the document's       |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=673.1)  | going to start at the beginning.                                                                         |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=674.86) | It has to paint something, but if it's only painting more at the bottom and you've gotten                |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=679.62) | those hints that prevent that massive scroll bar jump, I think this kind of put it all                   |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=684.06) | together for me finally.                                                                                 |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=685.38) | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=686.38) | I also did write a post that showed a demo on how this all works with some of the performance            |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=691.02) | gains, like, you know, black and white, like here's with, here's without.                                |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=694.78) | And we'll link down the show notes if you want to see how this actually works in practice                |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=697.78) | all together.                                                                                            |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=698.78) | Awesome.                                                                                                 |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=699.78) | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=700.78) | So let's talk about container queries.                                                                   |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=702.62) | And this brings us here because containment is what enabled container queries.                           |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=707.12) | It's what made them possible.                                                                            |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=708.12) | The fact that they are getting pulled off that tree into their own little space and                      |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=711.34) | can be evaluated on their own prevents a whole bunch of issues that people had with the concept          |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=717.62) | of container queries.                                                                                    |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=718.62) | So if you're not familiar with container queries, they're a way to style a child based on a              |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=722.04) | parent elements sizing information.                                                                      |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=724.66) | So like responsive design has been around for a long time.                                               |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=726.9)  | It's something that, but this is something that wasn't possible until now.                               |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=731.78) | We had the viewport only, but now we have the container.                                                 |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=734.9)  | So instead of just relying on the viewport, we can get information about the width of                    |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=739.58) | the actual block it's in.                                                                                |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=741.3)  | So the element can live anywhere on a page and maybe look different because it's in a                    |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=746.26) | different size container.                                                                                |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=747.5)  | This is an API that's still being worked on in the CSS working group, but it's now available             |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=751.58) | behind a flag in Canary to experiment with.                                                              |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=754.54) | And we are definitely going to go over container queries in another episode in depth.                    |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=759.64) | And with all the detail that you know and love from the show.                                            |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=762.62) | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                        |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=763.62) | So check that out.                                                                                       |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=764.94) | It's the at container property.                                                                          |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=766.82) | Also when you are setting a container query, you do need to set containment on the parent.               |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=771.5)  | So just, I mean, I think that now that we've gone through it, hopefully that makes sense                 |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=775.34) | a little bit why you need to do that.                                                                    |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=777.66) | But they go hand in hand and it's just so cool to see it in the browser, especially                      |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=783.06) | combined with CSS grid and flexbox where different pieces and tracks move independently of each          |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=789.02) | other and lets you really just create these micro layouts within macro layouts of media                  |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=796.98) | query based design.                                                                                      |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=798.46) | This is just something that I admire, like so, so excited about.                                         |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=803.82) | If you've been in the industry for a while, you're probably also like crying with joy                    |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=808.54) | about this like we are.                                                                                  |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=811.5)  | But it's just really cool to see how containment brings this all to life and how important               |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=817.54) | this is in this era of component based design.                                                           |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=823.26) | So yeah, thank you so much for joining us.                                                               |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=827.22) | Hopefully you learn a bit about containment and at container and content visibility and                  |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=831.98) | contain intrinsic size and all those good things.                                                        |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=834.3)  | Yeah, this is a heavy episode.                                                                           |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=835.6)  | I hope we broke down some of these very virtual imaginary concepts like these aren't typical             |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=840.38) | CSS things where you see your results of what you did.                                                   |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=844.06) | This is like a, I don't know, it's different.                                                            |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Cm2VoDbtAmOMLlf8g5Z1?&t=847.14) | It's optimizations for layout and paint.                                                                 |
