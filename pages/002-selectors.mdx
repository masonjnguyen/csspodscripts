| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=0.0)    | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=17.24)  | Today's topic is selectors.                                                                        |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=19.96)  | Selectors.                                                                                         |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=20.96)  | Selectors for Skeletor.                                                                            |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=23.16)  | Selectors, not selectants.                                                                         |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=27.2)   | We're stoked about selectors, as you can see.                                                      |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=29.64)  | It's a sweet word, and they're very fundamental to CSS.                                            |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=32.4)   | I also think they're way more powerful than we give credit to.                                     |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=35.64)  | They're really, really strong.                                                                     |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=36.64)  | Oh yeah.                                                                                           |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=37.64)  | They're so succinct.                                                                               |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=38.64)  | Going through all the different selectors in detail has really made me realize how much            |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=42.4)   | power you have when you're writing CSS, and I am excited to share it all.                          |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=47.24)  | So do you want to kick it off, Adam?                                                               |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=48.24)  | Yeah, I do.                                                                                        |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=49.24)  | So selectors.                                                                                      |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=50.24)  | What are we talking about?                                                                         |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=51.24)  | Oh no, I have to say selector, not selector.                                                       |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=52.24)  | This is going to be like specificity, where later we're not going to be able to say it.            |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=57.12)  | Selectors are a structure that match against elements in a tree.                                   |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=60.0)   | Turns out too, those elements that are matches, they're called subjects.                           |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=62.8)   | I don't know if that really matters a whole bunch, but it's kind of fun to know that there's       |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=65.64)  | like a proper terminology for the matched items of a selector.                                     |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=69.4)   | And CSS uses selectors to bind the style properties that you put inside of a declaration to the    |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=74.1)   | elements in the document.                                                                          |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=75.52)  | So just to recap really quick, a selector is one of two parts of a CSS rule, and we're             |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=79.36)  | going to go into some of this later, but a rule is the selector and all the style declarations.    |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=84.48)  | And so a selector is one of two parts of that, which is kind of nice.                              |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=87.94)  | And it's also fun to talk about, like you can group selectors together.                            |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=90.84)  | So it's just with a comma, you can have one really complex or very simple selector and             |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=95.36)  | just put a comma, specify another selector, and then open a curly bracket and you can              |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=99.68)  | list the rest of your declarations and finish the rule out.                                        |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=102.96) | So anyway, that's like the basics of a selector.                                                   |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=104.74) | It's like this one thing that helps us match our rules that we're defining some styles             |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=110.0)  | to those subjects, to those elements in the DOM.                                                   |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=112.76) | Super cool.                                                                                        |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=113.76) | So there's a lot of different ways to select subjects in the DOM.                                  |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=117.44) | And the first is through the use of simple selectors.                                              |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=120.46) | The first type of simple selector, the most general selector is called the universal selector.     |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=125.1)  | And this is that star.                                                                             |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=126.1)  | You could think of it as an asterisk.                                                              |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=128.04) | Maybe you've used this as a glob module and other programming languages before, but essentially    |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=132.28) | the selects every single one of a type.                                                            |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=135.04) | And then you can also combine this with other types of selectors to make it more specific.         |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=138.34) | But just in general, universal selector star selects all the things.                               |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=141.32) | Grab it all.                                                                                       |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=142.32) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=143.32) | And it's really good for controlling people too.                                                   |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=144.52) | The next one is a type selector.                                                                   |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=146.28) | So we're talking about simple selectors again, and this is the type selector and this is           |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=149.76) | based on the type of elements.                                                                     |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=151.26) | So this is a really common one when you write div, that you're using a type selector.              |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=155.2)  | If you're using a paragraph or an li, you're targeting these base elements in the DOM and          |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=161.16) | that is a type selector.                                                                           |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=162.68) | And then we have class selectors, which you can actually apply to type selectors.                  |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=166.08) | For example, you could apply a class of my image to a type of image elements.                      |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=171.34) | And with these, you have a little bit more specificity over those basic elements that              |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=175.76) | you can then use to style.                                                                         |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=177.32) | These are also recursive.                                                                          |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=178.42) | You can use a single selector for multiple different types of elements.                            |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=182.24) | For example, you could have a class of blue text and that blue text you could use with             |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=187.2)  | like font color blue and apply that to buttons and headlines and other places all throughout       |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=192.8)  | your application.                                                                                  |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=193.8)  | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=194.8)  | Classes are super important.                                                                       |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=195.8)  | There's methodologies about just how to name those and manage them.                                |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=198.24) | It's crazy.                                                                                        |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=199.24) | The next simple selector is the ID selector.                                                       |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=201.96) | And this one, there should be only one just like Highlander.                                       |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=204.72) | Oh, there is only one.                                                                             |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=206.44) | There is only one of the ID selector.                                                              |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=208.44) | So this is when you have a hashtag in front of a selector.                                         |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=210.8)  | And this is a very strong selector in terms of specificity because there should only be            |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=215.16) | one.                                                                                               |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=216.16) | So it's treated as a very specific call out to an element to a subject in the DOM.                 |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=220.24) | And it's also worth noting that CSS allows you to stack IDs in a selector.                         |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=224.12) | So you can have more than one ID in a selector.                                                    |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=225.92) | In fact, you can have the same ID repeated in a selector.                                          |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=229.16) | That's kind of weird, fun stuff about ID selectors.                                                |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=231.48) | Weird specificity hack there.                                                                      |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=234.16) | So the next type of selector is called the attribute selector.                                     |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=237.6)  | And this allows you to select subjects in your UI based on their attributes.                       |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=242.8)  | So an attribute could be like a data attribute or another type of attribute.                       |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=246.8)  | For example, language can be an attribute.                                                         |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=248.76) | You can check for the presence of a selector by using something like lang and attribute            |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=254.0)  | selectors would be inside of brackets.                                                             |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=256.26) | You could check for an exact value of a selector.                                                  |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=258.8)  | You could check for lang equals en if you're looking for en or even en-us if you're looking        |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=263.9)  | for US English specifically and you're going to style your site differently based on that          |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=268.56) | language.                                                                                          |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=269.56) | You can apply these two types or you can use them individually.                                    |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=272.84) | So another way to use this is through this like regex-y method.                                    |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=278.04) | And you could look for specific strings.                                                           |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=280.28) | So you could look for example, if you had an attribute called title, you could look                |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=284.1)  | for a selector that has title starts with a string.                                                |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=288.4)  | And that string could be dog, for example.                                                         |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=289.8)  | And that would look like in your brackets, title, it's that up carrot that looks like              |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=295.0)  | a reflected V. So it's like upwards V equals and then the string.                                  |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=300.88) | And that is going to look for something that starts with a string.                                 |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=304.58) | You could look for if that attribute contained a string, that would be the little swirly           |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=310.12) | like selector.                                                                                     |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=311.12) | The tilde.                                                                                         |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=312.12) | Yeah, tilde.                                                                                       |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=313.12) | I just call it a swirly.                                                                           |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=314.12) | It's good.                                                                                         |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=315.12) | It kind of looks edible.                                                                           |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=316.12) | It looks sweet, like a cinnamon roll.                                                              |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=317.44) | I could see that like a little dessert.                                                            |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=319.16) | Anyway, if you wanted to look for a title that contains a string like the word dog,                |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=323.8)  | that would look like your brackets, title, curly equals and then in quotes that string.            |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=329.96) | There's also a way to look for attributes that end with a string.                                  |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=334.36) | And that's what the dollar sign.                                                                   |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=335.9)  | So for example, there, if you were looking for a link that ended with a PDF, if you're             |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=340.28) | looking for links of the type PDF, you could look for A. And that's going to be combining          |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=345.16) | this actually with a type.                                                                         |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=346.84) | So you would have inside the attribute itself, you'd have the braces, href, dollar sign equals     |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=353.32) | then dot PDF inside of strings.                                                                    |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=355.72) | That would look for something that ends with that string dot PDF.                                  |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=359.76) | So you could style your PDFs differently than your other types of links.                           |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=361.88) | I think that's a pretty cool thing that you can do with CSS.                                       |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=364.52) | That's so cool.                                                                                    |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=365.52) | And then finally, thing that I learned is that you could set if these are case sensitive           |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=369.64) | or insensitive by providing a space between your attribute and the letter S for sensitive          |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=376.04) | or the letter I for case insensitive.                                                              |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=378.64) | So if you are really styling things very specifically through attribute selectors, that might come |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=384.26) | in handy.                                                                                          |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=385.26) | There's so much power inside of attribute selectors.                                               |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=387.48) | And I've used them in the past, like when I make little libraries with them, they can              |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=390.76) | feel like functions.                                                                               |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=392.8)  | So I'll put an attribute on an element and then pass in a parameter.                               |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=396.64) | So it'll be like, you know, grid columns equals three.                                             |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=400.68) | And now in my CSS, it's like someone called my grid columns function with a parameter              |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=404.72) | and I get to go use that in a calc function or something.                                          |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=407.96) | It's super cool.                                                                                   |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=408.96) | So thanks for talking about this.                                                                  |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=409.96) | And you can tie these with data attributes too.                                                    |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=412.24) | Good call.                                                                                         |
| [06:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=413.24) | There's a lot of power there.                                                                      |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=414.28) | And when you're using JavaScript, this is a great way to tie that in.                              |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=416.4)  | I agree.                                                                                           |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=417.4)  | So next we have pseudo selectors.                                                                  |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=419.28) | And these are things like pseudo elements and pseudo classes.                                      |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=422.88) | And it's so funny, it's really hard for me to distinguish these in my head between elements        |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=426.96) | and classes.                                                                                       |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=427.96) | But I'm going to try to help y'all maybe understand it a little bit easier.                        |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=431.84) | Pseudo elements are almost always, and they're intended to be targeting something structural       |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=437.3)  | about the content of the subject that you're targeting.                                            |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=441.08) | So a pseudo element selector would be something like the first line or the first letter.           |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=447.64) | These things are targeting the element inside of the subject.                                      |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=452.0)  | That's just kind of cool.                                                                          |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=453.0)  | So they're structural in the way that they look.                                                   |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=454.44) | You can also look for one that's empty.                                                            |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=456.02) | So the empty pseudo element is a selector that you can use to check to see if it's empty.          |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=461.32) | And the very common one is before and after.                                                       |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=463.6)  | So you can use pseudo elements before and after to create, well, they're not real elements.        |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=469.24) | They're sort of fake and mysterious and they're like phantoms in the dump.                         |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=472.68) | And then you have pseudo classes.                                                                  |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=473.84) | And I like to think about pseudo classes as sort of like platform provided states that             |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=478.52) | you can tie into.                                                                                  |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=479.52) | And so you have things like a link that's been visited or an input that's invalid.                 |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=484.1)  | And so I hope that that helped clear up what pseudo selectors, the difference between a            |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=487.96) | pseudo element and pseudo classes.                                                                 |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=489.52) | Anyway, I thought those are cool though.                                                           |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=491.16) | I like that definition.                                                                            |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=492.16) | I actually have a whole blog post on using the pseudo class visited to differentiate               |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=497.08) | links in your blogs.                                                                               |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=498.84) | So we'll have all these links at the end in our show notes.                                        |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=502.4)  | So the next type of selector are complex selectors.                                                |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=505.52) | And these are selectors that look for relationships between elements.                              |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=509.8)  | Unfortunately, you can't style a parent element, but you can style that parent's children or       |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=515.88) | style the parent itself based on its parent.                                                       |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=519.52) | So we're looking at this cascade downward relationship.                                            |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=523.18) | And these are combinators, which refer to the operators between elements.                          |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=527.16) | So the first type of combinator is a space between elements.                                       |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=531.36) | That would be the descendant combinator.                                                           |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=534.04) | If you have something like ul space li, then you're applying changes, you're applying styling      |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=540.06) | to list items within an unordered list.                                                            |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=543.42) | And this applies that styling recursively.                                                         |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=545.64) | So an example of this would be if you had indentation for that list item, and then you             |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=549.68) | had another unordered list within that list item, that list item would be indented even            |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=554.7)  | more because it's going to be applying that style with every single time you have an additional    |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=561.56) | parent child relationship.                                                                         |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=563.4)  | So that's kind of like how an outline works if you're thinking about it in terms of like           |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=566.9)  | a text document.                                                                                   |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=568.16) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=569.16) | Nailed that one.                                                                                   |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=570.16) | Descendant combinator, just this space.                                                            |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=572.32) | So complex selectors, we're talking about combinators, and I'm about to talk about the             |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=576.56) | child combinator, which was hard for me because I've always called it the direct descendant        |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=581.08) | combinator or a direct descendant selector.                                                        |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=583.96) | But apparently my verbiage was wrong.                                                              |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=585.36) | I am now corrected because it's a complex selector that is just using a child combinator.          |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=592.4)  | How fancy am I talking about CSS right now?                                                        |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=594.4)  | We're getting the terms down now.                                                                  |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=596.32) | So the direct descendant is a great one, or the child combinator rather.                           |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=600.16) | It would be so hard for me to shake it.                                                            |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=602.56) | It's nice because it limits that concept of recursion.                                             |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=605.8)  | So I call it like a recursion buster in that every time that you put this little greater           |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=609.76) | than sign between two simple selectors.                                                            |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=612.48) | So in this case, we have like ul, we were doing ul space li, but now we're going to                |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=616.96) | do ul greater than li.                                                                             |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=619.76) | And what that lets us do is it will only target the first li that is found in a ul and that        |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=624.96) | busts your recursion.                                                                              |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=626.16) | So it's not going to continue to look for lis inside of uls, inside of uls, and et                 |
| [10:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=630.52) | cetera.                                                                                            |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=631.52) | And yeah, I think this is a really healthy habit to get into is to try to use the child            |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=635.04) | combinator as much as possible.                                                                    |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=636.84) | Yeah, I think that that will help you be more specific so you don't run into the case where        |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=641.08) | you accidentally have styling applied to the child of that list item within that parent,           |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=646.16) | which can happen sometimes.                                                                        |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=648.0)  | So the next type of combinator is called a sibling combinator, the next sibling combinator         |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=653.44) | to be more specific.                                                                               |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=654.84) | And this has that plus sign in between elements.                                                   |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=658.62) | This would apply to an element that's the next sibling of the one before it.                       |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=663.84) | So if we had div plus p, for example, that paragraph would be next to the div, not within          |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=669.96) | it, meaning they're next to each other under the same parent, they're adjacent to each             |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=674.04) | other.                                                                                             |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=675.08) | So you can use this in a lot of different ways.                                                    |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=678.06) | One example that I really like is called the lobotomized owl hack slash method.                    |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=682.86) | This is from Hayden Pickering a couple of years ago.                                               |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=685.56) | And what this does is it solves this issue where you want to have spacing between your             |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=690.36) | list items, but that first list item or the last list item, you don't want to have that            |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=695.4)  | additional extra space.                                                                            |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=697.2)  | So if you were to apply styling to every single list item, say with a star, you would have         |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=702.48) | that additional space.                                                                             |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=704.24) | But if you do this lobotomized hack, you'd be writing that star, that universal selector,          |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=709.6)  | plus another universal selector.                                                                   |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=711.68) | This would only select elements that have a previous sibling adjacent to them.                     |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=716.88) | So if you were to apply a margin top to it, you wouldn't actually have the margin top              |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=720.68) | applied to that first element, just every subsequent element.                                      |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=723.68) | So it's like a nice dynamic little CSS trick for getting the styling the way you want it.          |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=728.36) | Yeah, I've always kind of like in the past done, you know, give them all margin top unless         |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=733.08) | you're the first of type or something like that.                                                   |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=735.68) | Like I'd use some sort of additional but I like this method better.                                |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=739.28) | This is kind of I don't know, it feels like it'll scale better because it's a little less          |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=742.2)  | specific.                                                                                          |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=743.2)  | Lots of different ways to do it.                                                                   |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=744.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=745.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=746.2)  | And the last combinator that we have is the subsequent combinator.                                 |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=748.08) | And this is the tilde.                                                                             |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=749.72) | And this is often used with where you can like leverage the state of a checkbox to change          |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=754.58) | the presentation of an adjacent element.                                                           |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=757.22) | And it's what it's most commonly used for.                                                         |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=759.4)  | But it's just the subsequent combinator.                                                           |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=760.92) | So this is if we had div tilde p, we'd be finding any p's that are just a subsequent               |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=767.0)  | element of a div.                                                                                  |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=768.56) | And so yeah, just kind of another cool combinator.                                                 |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=770.76) | Div swirly p got it.                                                                               |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=773.64) | So next and this is actually our last type of selector.                                            |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=777.08) | These are compound selectors.                                                                      |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=778.08) | And it's really hard to not talk about the other types of selectors without talking about          |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=782.12) | compound selectors because I feel like we commonly use things in this way.                         |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=786.0)  | This is when you combine selectors together really.                                                |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=788.78) | So an example would be like applying a class to a link, you could write a dot link to have         |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=793.88) | more specificity on that link item with the class of link.                                         |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=798.04) | You usually just have to write the class, but we'll get into that in our next episode.             |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=802.44) | And another way to use this would be when you're specifying states.                                |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=806.28) | So like a colon active or a colon hover would be an active or a hover state on that link.          |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=811.98) | So you can always be combining selectors together and compound selectors.                          |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=817.14) | And that was a lot of things that we just covered.                                                 |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=819.58) | I think we covered them pretty quickly.                                                            |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=821.88) | That was tons.                                                                                     |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=822.88) | Yeah, simple selectors, complex selectors, compound selectors, combinators.                        |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=826.48) | Oh yeah, we're all over.                                                                           |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=828.24) | It's awesome.                                                                                      |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=829.24) | Well, I hope you liked it because we're going to do more episodes on things just as deep           |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=833.0)  | as this.                                                                                           |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=834.0)  | Like we'll do one about declarations that would complete our understanding of rules                |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=837.64) | and rule sets in CSS, which reminds me like, hey, you know, what happens when two different        |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=842.04) | selectors match the same element?                                                                  |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=843.8)  | Wow, Adam, I'm so glad you asked.                                                                  |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=846.56) | I feel like we alluded to this a lot in this conversation because it's so hard to separate         |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=850.88) | these two concepts.                                                                                |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=852.48) | But we'll have to wait to talk about that in our next episode about specificity, where             |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4hv6ogNtJZtvxKcQ67Ctpn?&t=856.4)  | we'll deep dive even more.                                                                         |
