| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.               |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=17.72)   | Today we're breaking down some accessibility-related styling choices that can ensure a better user    |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=23.68)   | experience for all of your users.                                                                     |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=27.18)   | These include focus visibility and keyboard navigation styles, contrast, preference queries,          |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=33.04)   | and even some tricks that you can do to test accessibility using CSS alone.                           |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=38.8)    | Accessibility is a cornerstone of the web and we need to make sure it's top of mind                   |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=43.42)   | when building our web applications.                                                                   |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=46.2)    | Excellent intro.                                                                                      |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=47.2)    | That's like, you know, putting curb cutouts on the sidewalks that lead up to your house.              |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=51.12)   | Like that seems small and it goes a long way.                                                         |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=54.44)   | Anyway, you know, you're not just servicing...                                                        |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=56.56)   | Wait, what is a curb cutout?                                                                          |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=58.04)   | Oh, that's a, you know, we're okay.                                                                   |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=59.68)   | So normally a curb would be, you know, five inches above the ground all the way around                |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=63.04)   | a corner and a wheelchair or a skateboard can't get up it.                                            |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=66.28)   | A curb cutout is when they make it dip down.                                                          |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=68.8)    | Oh.                                                                                                   |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=69.8)    | You know, a little cutout so that folks can go up and down in a nice...                               |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=74.72)   | Like a ramp.                                                                                          |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=75.72)   | Like a ramp, a little mini ramp for each corner.                                                      |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=78.12)   | Yeah, a corner ramp.                                                                                  |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=79.48)   | Yeah, those are right and they're tiny and they seem innocent, but you end up servicing               |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=84.32)   | more people than you think with just little concerns like that.                                       |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=88.44)   | They go a long way.                                                                                   |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=89.44)   | So here is a whole lesson of all these different things that we think you can use CSS for.            |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=93.76)   | They're little CSS curb cutout ramps.                                                                 |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=96.36)   | Absolutely, yes.                                                                                      |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=97.72)   | Wait, CSS curb cutout.                                                                                |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=101.22)  | That's almost CSS for CCS.                                                                            |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=102.84)  | Okay, now I'm just rambling.                                                                          |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=104.64)  | Okay, so let's start with relative units and why are these important?                                 |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=107.92)  | Why are these always come up in conversations?                                                        |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=109.84)  | And usually you hear things like my browser settings where I can change my font size.                 |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=116.12)  | I have it set to really large or maybe yours is normal and you didn't even know you could             |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=120.32)  | change it.                                                                                            |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=121.32)  | And then the other one is browser zoom.                                                               |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=122.52)  | So really quick, what are these two things?                                                           |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=125.0)   | Browser settings is when you go into Chrome or Firefox in your options and you go to the              |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=128.76)  | appearance and you go to the font size and you can change it.                                         |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=131.88)  | And this sets the default font size for all the pages that load.                                      |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=134.36)  | This allows you to overwrite whatever the browser supplied as the default as the user.                |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=138.7)   | And my parents do this one all the time.                                                              |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=139.96)  | They're always browsing around in a really large font browser.                                        |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=143.6)   | And I think it's nice to see the way that they go around the web and they don't even                  |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=146.84)  | think about it anymore.                                                                               |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=147.88)  | To me, I look at it and I'm like, that's huge text.                                                   |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=149.96)  | It's like ruining the design.                                                                         |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=150.96)  | And to them, that's not what they're concerned about.                                                 |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=153.48)  | They're actually able to read it.                                                                     |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=154.68)  | My parents too actually, and they do it on their entire operating system.                             |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=157.9)   | So like in their messages app, everywhere.                                                            |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=160.12)  | Yeah, and yeah, to them it is still good design because they can see it, right?                       |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=164.76)  | And to them it's just more important to see it than to have some spacious thing.                      |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=168.56)  | Well, I would say it's bad design if they can't actually read the text.                               |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=172.52)  | Yeah, that too.                                                                                       |
| [02:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=173.88)  | That would be a huge problem.                                                                         |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=174.88)  | Or yeah, but that's kind of one of the things that people are getting at with browser settings        |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=177.92)  | is if you use something like pixels and you say your font size on your page is 14 pixels,             |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=182.28)  | then whatever your parents said doesn't matter anymore.                                               |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=184.82)  | And that can be an issue.                                                                             |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=185.96)  | Whereas if you use M's or REM's, your one REM or your one M when used at the root are                 |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=191.88)  | your parents' font size choices.                                                                      |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=194.04)  | And I just think that that's really nice.                                                             |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=195.4)   | It's sort of like building off of whatever.                                                           |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=198.08)  | It doesn't scale the pixels.                                                                          |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=199.64)  | That's what I think browser zoom is when you're like scaling.                                         |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=202.96)  | Anyway, so yeah, I have that as what browser zoom is.                                                 |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=205.76)  | If you hit Command plus or Control plus or minus on a page, you're essentially increasing             |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=210.0)   | the size of a pixel.                                                                                  |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=211.52)  | So like you can have 16 pixels in your dev tools for font size, but if you zoom in, it                |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=216.6)   | looks like more pixels, but it's still 16 pixels in your CSS.                                         |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=220.98)  | So like these are kind of tricky things, right?                                                       |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=222.32)  | You have like zooming the browser, which adjusts the size of a pixel, and then you have the           |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=226.48)  | user bringing a font size to the table as like a default.                                             |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=229.84)  | So the tip here is with relative units build on top of the font size that folks are bringing          |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=234.76)  | to the table, whether it's the browser bringing one or it's the user bringing one on top of           |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=238.84)  | there, use that as your baseline as sort of like this is the legibility of the font sizes,            |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=243.84)  | one REM or one M. I just think that's a healthy decision to make in your typography.                  |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=248.54)  | And then yeah, with browser zoom where folks can hit Command plus or minus to change the              |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=252.44)  | way that things scale, watch out for sticky elements in this scenario.                                |
| [04:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=255.98)  | Because sometimes they'll zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, and a sticky header and a footer                 |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=259.52)  | kind of start to consume more space, some more space until there's not a whole lot left.              |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=264.2)   | Oh yeah, that's a real problem.                                                                       |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=266.48)  | So these are just some things to think about that users can do to your page.                          |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=270.04)  | They can zoom it and they can bring their own font size and we should be respectful                   |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=273.46)  | to these things.                                                                                      |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=274.46)  | And the best way to do that is with relative units.                                                   |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=276.76)  | So yeah, that's a really good tip and point right there.                                              |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=280.58)  | So another thing that we do with CSS is creating themes and colors.                                   |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=285.26)  | And so that's why CSS is a great place to make sure that you're ensuring proper color                 |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=290.26)  | contrast scores in your UIs.                                                                          |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=293.94)  | Color contrast is definitely a big one for accessibility.                                             |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=296.58)  | You can use DevTools to test color contrast.                                                          |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=299.26)  | So if you're unaware what color contrast is, that's the foreground color on the background            |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=303.12)  | color and the ratio between those two colors and how well they differ from each other so              |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=308.08)  | that they stand out and the text is readable on top of the backgrounds.                               |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=312.72)  | You want to make sure these pass WCAG standards.                                                      |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=315.12)  | There are different standards for large text and for body text.                                       |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=318.58)  | So in DevTools, you'll actually see two different numbers and a little check mark if it passes.       |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=322.88)  | There's also a really nice like white line in the color picker where it'll show you what's            |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=328.22)  | underneath the contrast and what's actually above it so that what is contrasted enough                |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=333.82)  | for these standards as you're debugging.                                                              |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=337.2)   | That's like one of my favorite features that came out a few years ago and I was like, oh,             |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=339.5)   | this line, this line is so cool.                                                                      |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=341.42)  | Yeah, that's a hot tip.                                                                               |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=342.78)  | There's also a media query for prefers contrast where we're going to talk about that a little         |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=346.98)  | bit further in the show, but you could intensify the contrast or remove contrast based on this        |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=352.1)   | media query.                                                                                          |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=353.1)   | And then there's also a color contrast function in color level five.                                  |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=360.72)  | So what this would do is essentially you set a list of colors and the browser would choose            |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=365.26)  | the color with the best color contrast ratio to display from that list.                               |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=369.26)  | So you go write something like color contrast, pink first, and then this color list.                  |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=373.22)  | So you could have like red, blue, and you can put variables in here.                                  |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=375.74)  | So you could have like bar background color or vars some variable.                                    |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=380.36)  | And it would always have a contrasted visual based on this algorithm the browser is deciding          |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=388.46)  | for you.                                                                                              |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=389.46)  | So this is actually really good if you're changing color themes or you have a reusable                |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=393.0)   | component or using the same kind of styling.                                                          |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=395.68)  | This is definitely inspired from the Sass Compass color functions.                                    |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=402.9)   | And it's something that we want to see in CSS.                                                        |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=404.7)   | Not available yet, but it is in the color high spec.                                                  |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=407.18)  | Yeah, good tips on contrast passing.                                                                  |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=409.7)   | I think it's really important.                                                                        |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=411.3)   | Usually people don't have enough contrast, but I think there's even you can have too                  |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=415.74)  | much.                                                                                                 |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=416.74)  | So be careful of like they can jiggle.                                                                |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=418.74)  | If you've ever looked at your clock on a microwave and like that blue on the black, it just starts    |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=424.18)  | to wiggle.                                                                                            |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=425.18)  | That can happen when something's like too intense.                                                    |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=427.26)  | That's actually a really good point regards to saturation because you're getting that                 |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=431.34)  | vibration from the overly saturated colors next to each other.                                        |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=435.62)  | So like a pro tip for when you're doing a dark theme is to reduce the vibrancy of your                |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=440.62)  | theme colors.                                                                                         |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=441.74)  | So there's less contrast against darker backgrounds.                                                  |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=445.18)  | Definitely and it's cool because when you're in the dark and you're looking at those desaturated      |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=448.42)  | blues and pinks or whatever, they still are clearly colorful.                                         |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=453.34)  | But it's interesting.                                                                                 |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=454.34)  | You might have reduced it by 40 percent or so.                                                        |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=457.1)   | The other thing I want to mention too is that color contrast function accepts a number of             |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=460.78)  | how much ratio you want to pass as well.                                                              |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=463.14)  | So that's new in the spec.                                                                            |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=464.82)  | And so it was default just like the baseline body text contrast ratios.                               |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=469.06)  | But now you can say, no, pick the color from this list that passes 7.5 or something.                  |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=473.74)  | And you can sort of be explicit about what you want to be passing.                                    |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=477.66)  | And you could use those for when you're using the first contrast media features because               |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=482.7)   | then you could increase the amount of contrast that you need per media feature and have it            |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=487.94)  | written once and you just increase the default setting there.                                         |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=492.62)  | And you could even use that as a variable and have it updated inside of that media preference         |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=496.94)  | and have like a really robust contrast color system inside of your UI.                                |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=501.22)  | Wow.                                                                                                  |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=502.22)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=503.22)  | You're just pivoting a contrast variable inside of a function that then you could, yeah, change.      |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=507.38)  | You could adjust the contrast with a slider across your whole site by just changing one               |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=511.5)   | custom property.                                                                                      |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=513.78)  | Holy cow.                                                                                             |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=514.78)  | And have it be intentional.                                                                           |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=515.78)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=516.78)  | It's not like the browser is doing some forced algorithm for you.                                     |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=519.62)  | It's actually you as a designer of a web experience providing that experience for all these different |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=526.5)   | needs and preferences.                                                                                |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=528.18)  | Definitely.                                                                                           |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=529.18)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=530.18)  | Discord has a saturation slider now so users don't have to choose high or low contrast.               |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=534.3)   | They can pick it themselves.                                                                          |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=535.3)   | Like.                                                                                                 |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=536.3)   | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=537.3)   | Super cool.                                                                                           |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=538.3)   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=539.3)   | So that was on contrast.                                                                              |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=540.3)   | Obviously, contrast is super cool.                                                                    |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=541.3)   | It's quite complex.                                                                                   |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=542.3)   | It can kind of get into the little niche and details there.                                           |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=544.14)  | Let's talk about something that is visually hidden.                                                   |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=547.06)  | So the idea here is, well, you put something on a page that was visually supportive, but              |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=551.54)  | if someone is using a screen reader or they can't see, then this would just be obnoxious              |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=555.64)  | to make them have to pass over or even know existed in the content.                                   |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=559.62)  | So something's visually hidden.                                                                       |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=561.62)  | You get to just put the attribute here if you want.                                                   |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=564.7)   | ARIA-hidden equals true and that will hide something as visually hidden.                              |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=569.3)   | But if it's something you want to do a CSS or maybe you created the element with CSS,                 |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=573.5)   | like a pseudo element, you can do this with, you can make something visually hidden with              |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=577.1)   | width zero, height zero, overflow hidden.                                                             |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=580.82)  | There used to be really complicated versions of what I just described there that included             |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=584.48)  | text indent negative 999999999 and all sorts of crazy stuff.                                          |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=589.4)   | And these days you can be as minimal as width zero, height zero, overflow hidden, and then            |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=593.42)  | it won't be visible but can be found by a screen reader.                                              |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=596.6)   | So there's like complimentary strategies here.                                                        |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=598.54)  | Yes, and sometimes people will do like SR only as a class name for this to specify,                   |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=602.34)  | oh, this is screen reader only and they'll use that as a reusable class throughout their              |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=606.1)   | UI.                                                                                                   |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=607.22)  | If you do display none, it will not be read by a screen reader.                                       |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=611.26)  | So that's why you have to have something like this visually hidden style where you're doing           |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=616.02)  | overflow hidden and not giving it a pixel size, setting that to zero so that it doesn't               |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=621.62)  | skip over it as it's reading through the content.                                                     |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=627.54)  | This kind of brings me to the next point too, which is about using content to display data.           |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=633.1)   | So content is a CSS property.                                                                         |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=634.38)  | You can use it to display information, but we wouldn't really recommend that for any                  |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=639.14)  | key content for your site.                                                                            |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=641.38)  | And that's because screen readers have mixed results in how they read the content property.           |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=646.26)  | Most newer screen readers do actually read out the content property, but not all screen               |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=650.74)  | readers do.                                                                                           |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=651.74)  | So you have to be cognizant of how you're using content when it's not blank.                          |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=656.02)  | If you just have content equals, just like empty quotes, you're not going to have something           |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=658.78)  | read out.                                                                                             |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=659.78)  | I think that's obvious.                                                                               |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=660.78)  | If you have content equals like an emoji, you might have that read out.                               |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=664.3)   | So that's something to keep in mind.                                                                  |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=666.3)   | And if you're using content for like, say you're using a counter and you want to do                   |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=669.8)   | like a score, making a CSS game that may or may not be read out to your screen reader.                |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=675.52)  | So that could cause accessibility issues.                                                             |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=678.94)  | Another accessibility gotcha is when you're styling layout and using the order property               |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=683.66)  | in flex or grid containers.                                                                           |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=686.66)  | These change the visual order of content, but they don't change the DOM structure.                    |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=691.02)  | So now you're going to get a mismatch between what's visually represented on the page and             |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=695.8)   | what the DOM content is.                                                                              |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=698.26)  | And the screen reader is going to read the DOM content.                                               |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=700.4)   | You don't want a mismatch of the visual order of the page and how to navigate that visual             |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=704.7)   | order with the DOM content, because that's not only going to affect screeners, it's also              |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=708.9)   | going to affect keyboard navigation.                                                                  |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=710.62)  | It's going to be weird.                                                                               |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=711.62)  | It's going to cause a weirdness.                                                                      |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=713.14)  | First number content is king.                                                                         |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=715.14)  | Always start with that and make sure it's visible as we kind of talked about earlier                  |

| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=720.82)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=721.82)  | Good call.                                                                                            |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=722.82)  | There's things like you can hack masonries into the web, which visually look correct.                 |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=726.82)  | But if you were to tab through them, you'd have to go to the very bottom before you'd                 |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=731.78)  | get to the visually second item.                                                                      |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=733.5)   | So it can be, yeah, order is not necessarily something that should be always played with              |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=738.86)  | like that.                                                                                            |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=739.86)  | Great call on the accessibility tip.                                                                  |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=741.7)   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=742.7)   | Next one here is on focus, focus visible and focus within.                                            |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=746.3)   | Just don't disable focus, like outline none.                                                          |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=748.66)  | I don't really know any good excuses for that anymore.                                                |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=752.38)  | We have really great tools at hand.                                                                   |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=754.24)  | So if you're wondering when and where to use focus, we always like to give you the advice.            |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=759.02)  | Like if you have a hover event where you're providing feedback to a mouse user, show feedback         |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=764.3)   | to a keyboard or a gamepad user, right?                                                               |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=766.9)   | As they're using the joystick or their keyboard tab to move through your interface, make sure         |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=771.36)  | there's an outline for them.                                                                          |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=772.46)  | I know you really love that on your PlayStation.                                                      |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=775.26)  | Why not put it on your webpage?                                                                       |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=776.78)  | And also there's no focus visible within yet, but maybe we'll get something like that.                |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=781.82)  | I find focus within is just really, really fun to add to my interfaces.                               |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=786.54)  | It brings so much life.                                                                               |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=787.94)  | It like not only brings life, but it's also necessary because when you're tabbing through             |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=793.38)  | a menu that has a sub menu, if you just use focus and you're tabbing onto a child of that             |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=799.82)  | menu item, the menu disappears.                                                                       |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=802.1)   | Because if you're using like display block to have it appear, then you're no longer focusing          |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=807.08)  | on the parent, you're focusing on a child.                                                            |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=808.7)   | So focus within lets you continue styling the parent based on if you're focusing within               |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=813.12)  | it in a child element.                                                                                |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=814.7)   | Like other, before this, it wasn't possible.                                                          |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=816.86)  | I've run into this, it's like caused issues.                                                          |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=818.46)  | It's a good call.                                                                                     |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=819.46)  | It is required, isn't it?                                                                             |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=820.78)  | Because yeah, a child can steal the focus from the parent even though it's a child.                   |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=824.74)  | So this essentially allows the hierarchy to remain with the focus because you're kind                 |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=828.1)   | of drilling in on focus and you might not want to lose the context of where you came                  |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=832.26)  | from.                                                                                                 |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=833.26)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=834.26)  | And another focused style thing that's cool is outline offset.                                        |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=836.58)  | So you could do like an outline offset internally.                                                    |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=838.62)  | So you could do like a negative value and it's inside of the element.                                 |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=842.62)  | So that's nice.                                                                                       |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=843.62)  | You have like padding around a button and you want it to just kind of like have on the                |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=846.66)  | inside of that.                                                                                       |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=848.94)  | Or you could have it outside of it and have some space between the element and the outline            |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=853.14)  | a little bit.                                                                                         |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=854.14)  | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=855.14)  | Yeah, that is a hot tip.                                                                              |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=856.14)  | And then the breathing room that you can add to that outline kind of makes it a lot nicer.            |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=859.62)  | And yeah, that inside outset, right, which you sort of like the negative outline is really            |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=862.92)  | nice for if you have like overflow hidden on something and you can't even show the focus              |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=867.66)  | ring on the outside, you have to have it on the inside.                                               |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=870.98)  | And so yeah, knowing that there's a negative is a really great use case there.                        |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=873.58)  | Oh yeah, that's a good point.                                                                         |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=875.42)  | I also like animating the outset.                                                                     |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=877.68)  | So I have like a tweet where I was like, hey, here's like one line of CSS that checks to              |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=880.92)  | prefer motion.                                                                                        |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=881.98)  | And if motion is cool, it animates that focus ring from like a large ring to a little bit             |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=887.34)  | smaller.                                                                                              |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=888.34)  | So as you tab into things, it does this like focus zoom, it's just like, shoo, shoo.                  |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=891.74)  | Oh, that's cool.                                                                                      |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=892.74)  | I like that.                                                                                          |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=893.74)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=894.74)  | Right?                                                                                                |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=895.74)  | Super cool.                                                                                           |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=896.74)  | So accessibility is not only nice, like to have curb cutouts that are cool for folks                  |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=900.94)  | to like come up on your curb and say hello to your home and get your content.                         |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=905.0)   | It's also a moment for you to shine and show really unique interactions because people                |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=910.34)  | are going to interact with this and this is like, hi, I'm here and I'm listening and I                |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=913.66)  | know you're going to be here.                                                                         |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=914.66)  | Anyway, a way for you to differentiate, which leads us into these next preference media               |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=918.42)  | queries, right?                                                                                       |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=919.42)  | So these are ways for you to adapt your page to accommodate somebody who has expressed                |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=922.9)   | a preference somewhere.                                                                               |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=925.1)   | We'll start with the first one.                                                                       |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=926.1)   | Pretty con...                                                                                         |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=927.1)   | I think this is actually getting popular now to reduce motion.                                        |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=929.22)  | This is kind of fun, right?                                                                           |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=930.22)  | This used to be all like shiny and new and now it's feeling staple.                                   |
| [15:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=933.5)   | So prefers reduced motion, you can go into your operating system on Mac and on PC and                 |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=938.22)  | on Android and iOS, you can go set that motion.                                                       |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=941.34)  | You don't want it as much.                                                                            |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=942.34)  | You want reduced motion.                                                                              |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=943.62)  | And usually what the operating system will do is start cross fading things.                           |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=946.62)  | So instead of swooshy motion swipes in and out, you know, the whole screen is sort of                 |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=950.64)  | like going, they'll do a cross fade.                                                                  |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=952.64)  | And so that's what I like to bring into the web as well.                                              |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=954.5)   | I think as soon as they realized motion was harmful, but they realized cross fading was               |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=957.74)  | consistently okay, we should adapt those same patterns onto the web.                                  |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=961.62)  | So consider a cross fade instead of what I usually see is duration zero.                              |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=966.54)  | Usually folks go in and they'll say, oh, I prefers reduced motion.                                    |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=968.9)   | Let me go grab every animation I have in my whole thing and just slam it down to zero                 |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=973.46)  | duration so now it's instant.                                                                         |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=975.92)  | And I don't know, I think you've lost a lot at that point and I think there's room to                 |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=979.86)  | be better.                                                                                            |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=980.86)  | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                        |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=981.94)  | And I also think that motion on the web is not just a nice to have, it also helps the                 |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=986.06)  | user understand what's happening.                                                                     |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=987.82)  | So when you remove it completely, you lose the context and that context is really important           |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=994.1)   | because when you're on the web or in a digital space, you're trying to imitate connection.            |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=998.26)  | And in the real world, you see where things are coming from, where things are moving to.              |
| [16:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1001.66) | If someone just appeared in front of you out of nowhere, just popped up, you'd be freaked             |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1005.7)  | out, right?                                                                                           |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1006.7)  | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1007.7)  | But you see them walk in front of you.                                                                |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1008.7)  | So you see where they're coming from.                                                                 |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1009.7)  | It's a lot more natural.                                                                              |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1010.7)  | I think that that is what motion on the web gives us.                                                 |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1013.46) | It gives us a much more natural, understandable user experience.                                      |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1018.44) | And yeah, and what I've talked to, or at least the folks that I've met say that reduced motion        |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1021.78) | for them is almost always motion that they're not in control of, right?                               |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1025.38) | They're okay scrolling the page, they're okay riding in a car, but they might not be as               |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1028.72) | okay being a passenger in the car.                                                                    |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1030.98) | There might not be okay if your site is moving things in front of them.                               |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1035.28) | They're like, I need to be doing that.                                                                |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1037.02) | If my finger is moving them, I don't get motion sickness, but if you're moving them and I             |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1040.48) | sit there and I watch them too long.                                                                  |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1042.42) | So anyway, reduced motion, that's usually where it's coming from.                                     |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1045.1)  | And I think it's really fun to work around.                                                           |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1047.14) | I've found a lot of my CrossFade animations are actually cooler than they were when they              |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1050.9)  | were motioned.                                                                                        |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1051.9)  | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1052.9)  | The next preferred preference is reduced data.                                                        |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1056.22) | So this can kind of come in two different ways that someone might express this.                       |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1059.94) | So they might express this at the operating system level and like a data saver mode that              |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1063.54) | you'll see on mobile.                                                                                 |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1064.54) | This also could be set in the browser as a light mode.                                                |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1067.44) | So Opera and other browsers will do this light mode for you, Chrome as well.                          |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1071.5)  | And it will condense images and try to do things on the server that save your data.                   |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1076.06) | Because the consideration here is the users express like, hi, I'm in a constricted data               |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1081.14) | scenario and I can't just, you know, I'm not on Wi-Fi on the West Coast of America.                   |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1085.42) | So can you give me a lighter load?                                                                    |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1088.74) | That'd be really nice.                                                                                |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1089.74) | And so this is an opportunity to maybe send less fonts, to not send the huge background               |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1093.78) | images that are one megabyte or something like that, and to just adapt your page lightly              |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1098.36) | to this reduced data set or just reduced data preference.                                             |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1101.7)  | I also had a fun use case recently.                                                                   |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1103.7)  | It's like if you're on Netflix and what are you doing when you're searching for a movie?              |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1107.62) | You just want a movie.                                                                                |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1108.62) | But if you were in a light data mode, you just need to know the title.                                |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1111.22) | Like those images are actually tons and tons of downloads and they're only really supportive.         |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1116.16) | And so I was able to make this interface that easily pivoted from itself being like a very            |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1120.34) | thumbnail driven interface to a very list driven interface.                                           |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1123.82) | It was just like a list of movie links.                                                               |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1125.38) | And I thought it was really cool.                                                                     |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1126.38) | It almost like, I was like, I kind of prefer the links.                                               |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1128.9)  | I can see more movies at one time and it loaded faster.                                               |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1132.62) | So it's like, oh, okay, very cool.                                                                    |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1134.82) | Win-win.                                                                                              |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1135.82) | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1136.82) | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1137.82) | So there's a few other prefers media queries.                                                         |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1138.98) | There's prefers contrast, which I kind of talked about earlier.                                       |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1143.82) | This has two values.                                                                                  |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1145.5)  | You could do more or less.                                                                            |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1146.5)  | So you could do ad media prefers contrast more or ad media prefers contrast less.                     |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1149.94) | And you can style your content to have greater or less contrast when needed.                          |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1154.34) | There is no browser support for this yet.                                                             |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1155.86) | It's still experimental, but it is behind a flag and you could start to explore it there.             |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1161.68) | So just keep that in mind.                                                                            |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1163.58) | But there's also another prefers media query that has very wide browser support.                      |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1168.62) | All modern browsers support prefers color scheme, and this accepts the values of light                |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1172.86) | or dark and lets you apply styles for color themes.                                                   |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1177.42) | You should always be mindful of your user's preferred color theme and give them a robust              |
| [19:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1182.1)  | first class UI based on that preference.                                                              |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1185.66) | Because your user doesn't want to be browsing in bed at night and get blindsided by a light           |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1190.06) | theme.                                                                                                |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1191.1)  | And at the same time, they don't want to be at the beach and just unable to read what's               |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1194.94) | on the screen because it's too dark.                                                                  |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1197.14) | There is a time and a place for different UIs.                                                        |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1201.02) | And this is an area where I feel like it's not just for decoration.                                   |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1206.42) | Color themes are really a usability feature.                                                          |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1209.66) | So that's why we wanted to include that in the show that accessibility because the color              |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1214.42) | theme that your user is in, which can be automated by the browser based on time of day.               |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1221.08) | And also environment that helps people use your site as a usability feature.                          |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1226.74) | Yep, most definitely.                                                                                 |
| [20:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1227.94) | I think it feels like a preference to but in the moment it could be a complete differentiator         |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1234.74) | between whether you can read it or not.                                                               |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1236.1)  | You're right.                                                                                         |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1237.1)  | So yes, be very considerate of their color scheme preferences.                                        |
| [20:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1239.82) | All these preferences are super exciting.                                                             |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1241.74) | And I'm going to move on to different types of input.                                                 |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1243.78) | So if we're talking about like curb cutouts, you know, if you don't have a curb cutout,               |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1247.66) | that means you've made your interface for people with legs.                                           |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1251.78) | And so on the web, we have, you know, usually people make a website for someone with a mouse.         |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1256.34) | But the reality is fingers also visit, you know, stepped mouses visit.                                |
| [21:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1261.14) | They're not all smooth scrolling mouses.                                                              |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1263.28) | Some people are visiting from a keyboard.                                                             |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1264.78) | It could be coming from their Nintendo Switch, from a screen reader, from a Kindle.                   |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1268.42) | Who knows?                                                                                            |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1269.42) | There's all sorts of different devices that browse the web with different types of input              |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1272.38) | that might not just be legs.                                                                          |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1274.18) | And so you can add some curb cutouts and check the capabilities of your visitor to see whether        |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1278.78) | or not you need to make some of these adjustments.                                                    |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1280.74) | So one thing I like to mention here with all these different types of input is scroll snap            |
| [21:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1284.0)  | points is very good at handling all of these from arrow keys to stepped mouses to the all             |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1289.34) | the even shortcuts.                                                                                   |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1290.34) | Like if you hold shift and scroll your mouse wheel, you'll do a horizontal scroll.                    |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1293.5)  | You get that sort of stuff for free.                                                                  |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1294.7)  | All those accessibility considerations and input types with scroll snap points.                       |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1298.66) | And so I really liked that about that one.                                                            |
| [21:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1300.06) | It's not just a good carousel type of replacement.                                                    |
| [21:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1302.98) | It actually comes with a bunch of other really goodies.                                               |
| [21:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1304.94) | But so do radio buttons, like a properly formatted group of radio buttons will use your arrows        |
| [21:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1309.18) | too.                                                                                                  |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1310.18) | So you don't just have to tab through a radio group.                                                  |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1312.14) | You can use your arrows to go through it.                                                             |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1313.86) | And then your enter and space bar button start to do different stuff.                                 |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1316.18) | So anyway, be really considerate of the different inputs that come.                                   |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1319.62) | There's two media queries that can help you here.                                                     |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1321.42) | One of them is media pointer course, or just like pointer find.                                       |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1324.86) | You can query on the pointer how specific it can find of an area, right?                              |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1328.5)  | Like if something is pointer course, it'd be very loose like your finger.                             |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1331.14) | It's not very precise and something that's pointer find would have high precision like                |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1334.66) | a mouse and you can adjust the size of your buttons.                                                  |
| [22:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1336.9)  | So you could say, Hey, if someone's visiting from a desktop on a big, large screen and                |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1340.98) | they have a mouse, we could pack tons of buttons into this toolbar.                                   |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1345.46) | But if someone's on a mobile device and there's not as much viewport space, let's add some            |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1349.36) | really nice big round buttons that are 44 pixels wide or whatever, right?                             |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1352.5)  | So we make sure that we have a good touch area for your finger.                                       |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1355.22) | Same thing with hover.                                                                                |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1356.3)  | You can query to make sure your device is capable of hover before you tuck something                  |
| [22:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1359.52) | behind hover.                                                                                         |
| [22:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1360.86) | And I think that's a really nice consideration because sometimes you have to hover to see             |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1364.34) | more.                                                                                                 |
| [22:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1365.34) | And it's like, well, that's not fair to touch devices, which are probably the dominant one            |
| [22:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1368.86) | coming to your site right now.                                                                        |
| [22:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1370.06) | So you should have an alternative way to show that content that's not just behind a hover.            |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1374.38) | So yeah, those are some inputs and some considerations there.                                         |
| [22:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1377.14) | Yeah, definitely good calls.                                                                          |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1379.66) | And we also talked about sort of designing for mobile devices with the different media                |
| [23:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1384.58) | types in our last episode.                                                                            |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1386.34) | So if you're interested in that, check out our last episode, which is episode 48, all                 |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1390.86) | about designing and using CSS styling for touch devices.                                              |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1395.74) | Another cool thing that you can do with your CSS is actually lint your HTML with CSS.                 |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1400.58) | I think Adam started this hashtag, hashtag lint HTML with CSS on Twitter to start collecting          |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1405.66) | some of the cool things that you can do to do kind of like style linting and kind of                  |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1412.66) | error handling directly in your CSS.                                                                  |
| [23:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1415.24) | So because you can use CSS for selecting certain markup in your DOM, you can select things            |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1422.98) | that don't have proper formatting.                                                                    |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1425.66) | So for example, you can select for any link that doesn't have an href filled out and like             |
| [23:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1430.98) | highlight that like, oh, this is a placeholder or this doesn't have a link, fill this out.            |
| [23:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1436.34) | For accessibility purposes, you could do things like select any images that have missing or           |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1440.26) | blank alt tags.                                                                                       |
| [24:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1441.8)  | You could then style these in a funky way, like you put a big red border around them.                 |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1445.62) | Another cool thing that you can do is use siblings.                                                   |
| [24:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1448.36) | So the sibling selector and ordering to make sure you have valid CSS.                                 |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1452.12) | You can check to make sure that your h2s are always following your h1s and not before them            |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1456.34) | and so on.                                                                                            |
| [24:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1457.74) | And make sure that you don't break the document object model order and confuse screen readers.        |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1462.74) | And also like navigation tools, the tools that a lot of people use to navigate sites                  |
| [24:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1468.26) | very much rely on landmark roles and semantic markup.                                                 |
| [24:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1472.58) | So you can use CSS to sort of lint your HTML and make sure that this is in the proper order           |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1477.94) | that you would expect it to be.                                                                       |
| [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1479.58) | Yeah, this like started out as just some red outlines over, yeah, simple things like a                |
| [24:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1484.02) | missing href on a link.                                                                               |
| [24:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1486.58) | You're like, okay, just outline that in red.                                                          |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1488.94) | Turns out other folks have been doing things like this for a long time.                               |
| [24:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1491.58) | That's really cool.                                                                                   |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1492.58) | There's like from snippets to libraries you can find.                                                 |
| [24:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1494.74) | And yeah, go ahead and check out that hashtag.                                                        |
| [24:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1496.82) | There's lots to like review in there.                                                                 |
| [24:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1498.5)  | I found that the is selector.                                                                         |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1500.1)  | So I kind of started doing with the is selector because I would notice that the browser had           |
| [25:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1503.5)  | them or maybe there was someone who had thought of this before, but they had really long selectors    |
| [25:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1506.98) | trying to articulate some of this stuff.                                                              |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1508.42) | And I was like, oh, is really makes some of these succinct.                                           |
| [25:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1510.94) | I'm just going to go ahead and check some of these out.                                               |
| [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1513.54) | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                     |
| [25:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1514.54) | Like the headers one.                                                                                 |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1515.58) | Like the headers one.                                                                                 |
| [25:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1516.58) | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| [25:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1517.58) | And then there's also, yeah, I mentioned some CSS libraries and some of them are funny.               |
| [25:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1520.54) | There's like revenge.css.                                                                             |
| [25:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1522.2)  | So this by Hayden and this essentially you load it on the page.                                       |
| [25:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1524.94) | All you have to do is just load it on the page and it just puts Comic Sans red comments               |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1529.94) | everywhere and outlines everything in red.                                                            |
| [25:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1532.92) | And it's like this really blunt, bold, just like, look at all this broken stuff on your               |
| [25:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1537.02) | page.                                                                                                 |
| [25:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1538.02) | And it's usually like a lot, you're like, oh, okay, this CSS file is getting revenge                  |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1542.22) | on me.                                                                                                |
| [25:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1543.26) | But then some of them are a little bit nicer about it.                                                |
| [25:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1545.18) | And I think there's even some collections in that hashtag folks went and grabbed all                  |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1548.54) | the tweets and grabbed all the libraries and tried to put them in one repo.                           |
| [25:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1551.52) | So if you're interested in that, I think there's a lot to be explored.                                |
| [25:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1554.3)  | There's also some experimental CSS for screen readers.                                                |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1557.98) | This was formerly called the oral box model.                                                          |
| [26:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1560.58) | It's now called the CSS speech API.                                                                   |
| [26:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1563.22) | It isn't a candidate recommendation, the CSS speech module one, but it's not supported                |
| [26:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1567.98) | anywhere yet.                                                                                         |
| [26:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1568.98) | I wasn't really able to find a lot of great information about this online.                            |
| [26:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1573.22) | So just be aware that this is a strong idea, but it seems that browsers have not yet implemented      |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1578.86) | this.                                                                                                 |
| [26:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1579.86) | So with the speech API, you can style the audio bits of how a screen reader sounds when               |
| [26:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1584.46) | it reads content out loud and how fast it reads the content.                                          |
| [26:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1587.98) | You can control the speed, pitch and rate, the sound levels, voices, things like that.                |
| [26:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1592.64) | So properties that are included within this are voice family.                                         |
| [26:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1596.34) | So that would be like the name of the voice, which is very similar to a font family, but              |
| [26:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1599.62) | for audio.                                                                                            |
| [26:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1601.02) | And you can do this in your terminal actually, if you use, I think it's S or slash S where            |
| [26:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1607.08) | you do like S and you say the name of the voice and then you type something, it'll read               |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1610.98) | it out loud.                                                                                          |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1611.98) | So I used to do this all the time when I worked at IBM, we would like just like mess with             |
| [26:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1616.62) | each other and like it was a quiet office and then you would just have your browser                   |
| [27:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1619.86) | like read out some, like, I don't know, some joke or something to someone else.                       |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1625.3)  | And I liked the voice Vicky for some reason.                                                          |
| [27:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1627.54) | It was kind of like an Australian accent, female voice.                                               |
| [27:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1630.62) | I thought it was, that was my voice that I used, but there's a bunch of voices.                       |
| [27:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1634.7)  | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| [27:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1635.7)  | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| [27:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1636.7)  | There's voices.                                                                                       |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1637.7)  | There's voices that sound like very robotic to ones that sound, have like a more like                 |
| [27:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1641.26) | human gate to speaking.                                                                               |
| [27:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1643.46) | So I play with that.                                                                                  |
| [27:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1644.58) | It's fun.                                                                                             |
| [27:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1645.58) | There's also voice balance, which is really cool.                                                     |
| [27:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1647.46) | That's actually the direction of speech the voice is coming from.                                     |
| [27:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1649.54) | So left or right, like which, which ear, I feel like this could be used for some really               |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1653.66) | cool audio APIs.                                                                                      |
| [27:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1654.92) | There's voice rate, which is the speed of speaking a voice pitch, which is the frequency              |
| [27:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1660.54) | you do like high, low, and there's voice stress, which is about word emphasis.                        |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1664.92) | So some really interesting things in here.                                                            |
| [27:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1667.46) | I haven't found a place to really explore this too much yet in browsers, but give this                |
| [27:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1671.82) | back a read if you're curious.                                                                        |
| [27:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1674.14) | It seems pretty cool.                                                                                 |
| [27:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1675.14) | Wow.                                                                                                  |
| [27:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1676.14) | I could make like a Dom wrapper.                                                                      |
| [27:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1677.14) | And I don't mean that with like a WR.                                                                 |
| [27:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1678.74) | I mean like a RAP.                                                                                    |
| [28:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1679.74) | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| [28:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1680.74) | Rapper library.                                                                                       |
| [28:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1681.74) | I could change the frequency, put some emphasis on the right words, you know, and like give           |
| [28:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1685.14) | it some rhymes.                                                                                       |
| [28:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1686.14) | All right.                                                                                            |
| [28:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1687.14) | So next tip is on font family system UI.                                                              |
| [28:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1689.96) | So this is a tip where it's basically, you will always have the glyphs for a language                 |
| [28:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1695.66) | without loading a bunch of extra variants if you use system UI.                                       |
| [28:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1699.18) | So if you're being considered of an international audience, which I think you should, but if          |
| [28:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1703.58) | you are translating and you want the document to be in that native language and everything,           |
| [28:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1707.58) | the system UI is phenomenal for showing that paragraph content and even that header content,          |
| [28:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1712.3)  | because any of the unique aspects of that language that come through in the translation               |
| [28:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1716.8)  | that you receive are going to be present without any extra work and without a big download.           |
| [28:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1721.26) | So anyway, I think that's just a huge benefit of that.                                                |
| [28:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1723.62) | And when you use the system UI on Mac OS and things like that, you can upgrade a lot of               |
| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1727.84) | its font variant settings because it's a variable font and you can tweak it all over the place.       |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1733.58) | And so it can kind of be like a hundred different fonts in one that always have the glyph that        |
| [28:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1737.86) | you need.                                                                                             |
| [28:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1739.1)  | And you know, the user is already used to reading it.                                                 |
| [29:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1741.66) | It's what they read all day in the rest of their interface and their operating system.                |
| [29:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1745.5)  | And so I like that aspect about it.                                                                   |
| [29:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1747.42) | So that could be a good considerate font family.                                                      |
| [29:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1749.86) | And then this last tip is for fluid typography gotcha.                                                |
| [29:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1753.58) | So this is often I avoided fluid typography because it would go too small or too large.               |
| [29:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1760.06) | It could be so large it's not legible even by someone who's good at reading and it could              |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1765.5)  | be so small that it's just like no one could read that.                                               |
| [29:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1767.94) | And so what we have now though is instead of trying to do too much like truly fluid                   |
| [29:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1772.58) | typography use min max and clamp and give a value whatever the low end is, make sure                  |
| [29:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1777.9)  | it never goes smaller than one rem and do that same thing for a maximum.                              |
| [29:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1781.66) | So we have these abilities now to throw in these functions into these whether yeah, if                |
| [29:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1785.1)  | you want to use a fluid typography system, if you want to use locks or whatever it is                 |
| [29:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1788.34) | that you're using, it's still healthy to put in these min and max functions that keep healthy         |
| [29:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1792.8)  | mins and maxes in there because of things like browser zoom and font size preferences                 |
| [29:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1798.66) | and a combination with your viewport unit calculation and all sorts of stuff.                         |
| [30:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1802.66) | So if you just throw these in there, it can save your layout.                                         |
| [30:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1805.14) | So just want to throw that tip in there.                                                              |
| [30:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1806.62) | Yeah, nice.                                                                                           |
| [30:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1807.62) | I feel like people don't typically think of layout as an accessibility concern, but it                |
| [30:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1811.74) | very much is.                                                                                         |
| [30:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1813.42) | So I'm glad that you brought that into this podcast and we have reached the end.                      |
| [30:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1820.3)  | So thank you for joining us.                                                                          |
| [30:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3gpPwzRw80Cj7NiBNIlE2I?&t=1821.62) | We have been true to our intro today and actually talked to accessibility.                            |
