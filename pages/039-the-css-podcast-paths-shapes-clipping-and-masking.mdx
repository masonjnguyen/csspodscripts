| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.                |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=17.84)   | Today we're talking about paths, shapes, clipping, and masking.                                        |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=21.08)   | Oh my!                                                                                                 |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=22.12)   | We wanted to combine these topics to discuss all the things that you can do with CSS in                |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=26.04)   | terms of building shapes, framing them, and using them to create cutouts.                              |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=31.32)   | And there are some pretty cool things that you can do in CSS with clipping masks and                   |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=34.68)   | shapes and paths to write those shapes and all sorts of topics.                                        |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=39.24)   | So yeah, I want to dive into this one.                                                                 |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=41.64)   | Yeah, this is also the way I would start interviews for a lot of front end work as I'd be like,        |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=47.0)    | okay, so boxes you should be familiar with, right?                                                     |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=49.8)    | Okay, let's make a circle.                                                                             |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=51.04)   | It's like, show me all the ways that you like to make circles and if you want, tell me why             |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=54.84)   | you like to make circles that way.                                                                     |
| [00:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=56.8)    | And then we'd move on to triangles and it would be like the first five or ten minutes                  |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=60.0)    | of the interview was just...                                                                           |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=61.52)   | There's so many ways.                                                                                  |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=62.52)   | Yeah, there's so many ways and I feel like it's so relevant to the work that we do.                    |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=66.52)   | Like you'll get a unique design and you'll have to make shapes and put shapes next.                    |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=71.68)   | Sometimes you combine two triangles to make a diamond, you know, like you have to get                  |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=75.8)    | creative.                                                                                              |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=76.8)    | Anyway, so yes, this is a near and dear topic to my heart and so the first way that you                |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=81.52)   | can make shapes, well, other than just changing your box size, right, you can have border              |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=85.4)    | radius and stuff like that, but is with clipping and that's clip path.                                 |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=89.44)   | This can be handy for transitions like revealing or hiding something on a stage.                       |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=94.12)   | You can make shapes.                                                                                   |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=95.24)   | So it has shape syntax for perfect circles and rounded rectangles and polygons and all                 |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=101.0)   | sorts of cool things there.                                                                            |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=102.72)  | And then we have masking is another way to make shapes and the mask effect is really                   |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=108.0)   | nice for like text effects.                                                                            |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=109.96)  | If you watch an After Effects video of like an intro to like a TV show, there are just                 |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=113.64)  | so many masks in there just getting animated and transitioned together, which makes them               |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=117.36)  | go well with blended effects and displacement maps and things like that.                               |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=121.42)  | You can also do exclusion shapes.                                                                      |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=124.44)  | So you can do things like shape outside, which lets you, for example, instead of having a              |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=128.48)  | box be the container of your element, you can make it whatever shape you want.                         |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=133.24)  | So say you want that to be a circle and text will flow around that shape and give you that             |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=137.88)  | nice unique effect that's not just like boxes all over the web.                                        |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=142.08)  | Yeah, that's a good point.                                                                             |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=143.32)  | It's like each of these have very distinct powers, right?                                              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=145.96)  | Like clipping is math driven.                                                                          |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=147.68)  | It can make these really sharp shapes.                                                                 |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=150.64)  | Masking can make shapes, but it's much better at sort of blending effects that go from like            |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=155.48)  | some sort of gradient and then exclusions change the where the text flows.                             |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=160.48)  | Cool.                                                                                                  |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=161.48)  | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=162.48)  | Let's okay.                                                                                            |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=163.48)  | So we got paths and shapes.                                                                            |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=164.48)  | So they can be filled with three different CSS types.                                                  |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=167.04)  | There are CSS types for shapes and it's the shape box, the basic shape or an image.                    |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=172.58)  | And each of these have distinct characteristics, features and advantages.                              |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=175.72)  | Kind of like we've talked about there, but we're going to dive into those a lot more.                  |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=178.64)  | And I'm going to start with the shape box, which I think is the most abstract one.                     |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=181.84)  | It was the one that caught me off guard the most.                                                      |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=183.96)  | And this is your element.                                                                              |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=185.72)  | So like if your element has a border radius, it's a shape box.                                         |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=189.84)  | It's a box with a shape.                                                                               |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=191.28)  | And it's just like live DOM nodes on the page.                                                         |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=193.78)  | And these can be circles and triangles, right?                                                         |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=195.24)  | You can change your box shape and kind of create elements that use the box model, right?               |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=201.24)  | And you have aspect ratios, border tricks.                                                             |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=204.32)  | You can do a lot with pseudo elements.                                                                 |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=205.72)  | I think pseudo elements often employ this shape box effect.                                            |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=209.08)  | And yeah, it's just leveraging the box model to provide a shape that can clip another box.             |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=214.72)  | So that's the whole point here is a shape box is a live DOM node that will be used to                  |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=218.84)  | clip another box.                                                                                      |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=220.12)  | Yeah, definitely a lot that you can do with styling just basic DOM nodes.                              |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=224.84)  | I think border radius is the best example of that, where you're physically creating                    |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=230.46)  | a clip of that element to no longer be a box.                                                          |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=233.64)  | It now has a radius.                                                                                   |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=236.76)  | So that sort of takes me now into the basic shapes.                                                    |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=239.84)  | There are a few of these.                                                                              |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=240.92)  | You could do a circle.                                                                                 |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=242.6)   | So you could do like just you put a radius and a position.                                             |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=247.38)  | That radius can be an absolute value, it could be a percentage value.                                  |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=249.96)  | And then you write at and then the position.                                                           |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=252.4)   | So for example, if you want to do like a shape outside, you could do a circle 50 percent               |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=257.0)   | and that creates a circle, a perfect circle.                                                           |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=260.0)   | It takes up the space.                                                                                 |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=262.02)  | You could do circle 50 percent at 20 percent, 20 percent, and then that would place the                |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=266.4)   | circle on the box in a position that's offset, probably the top left corner.                           |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=272.84)  | That's where it would be.                                                                              |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=274.16)  | So there's also ellipse, which is similar to circle, but you have two different radii.                 |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=277.9)   | You have the x and y radius, so you could set our x and our y to define what the ellipse               |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=282.96)  | looks like.                                                                                            |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=283.96)  | It's not even all the way around like a circle.                                                        |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=285.92)  | Then there's polygons.                                                                                 |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=286.92)  | So you can set points to draw a polygon using x and y coordinates.                                     |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=291.36)  | So what that would look like is within the property, you'd write something like shape                  |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=295.18)  | outside colon.                                                                                         |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=296.18)  | And then on the right hand side of that property value pair, the value would be polygon and            |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=301.76)  | then in parentheses 50px, 0, 100px, 100px, 0, px, 100px.                                               |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=307.32)  | And those xy pairs, all three of them are separated by a comma.                                        |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=310.78)  | So that would actually create a triangle because you would be starting at 50, 0, which is the          |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=314.8)   | top center.                                                                                            |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=315.8)   | You go to 100, 100, which is the bottom right corner.                                                  |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=319.34)  | And then you go to 0, 100, which is the bottom left corner if you had a 100 pixel box.                 |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=324.12)  | So that creates like a perfect little triangle.                                                        |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=327.12)  | You can also use percentages.                                                                          |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=328.66)  | So you can use 50 percent, 100 percent, 100 percent, 0, 100 percent.                                   |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=332.3)   | That's probably going to be used more often.                                                           |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=333.8)   | And there's also paths.                                                                                |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=335.9)   | So we have polygons, now we have path where you can create path based shapes very similar              |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=340.34)  | to SVG paths where you use a similar syntax to that.                                                   |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=344.22)  | And then there's also inset, which is interesting.                                                     |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=345.92)  | So inset is just a rectangle, but then you can create an inset shape around it.                        |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=352.0)   | So you could have the inset kind of like pull in from the rectangle and you could shape                |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=359.38)  | that rectangle.                                                                                        |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=360.38)  | So you could like use keywords like round.                                                             |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=363.34)  | You could set values that are absolute like pixel values or percentages.                               |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=367.5)   | And the cool thing is that you can animate all these.                                                  |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=369.14)  | So with inset, you could do like an animation where you have like a box expand from the                |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=376.38)  | center out or opposite out in using the inset and animate it.                                          |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=381.72)  | And if you want to start playing with these, another cool thing is Firefox has a cool like             |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=384.94)  | little shape inspector.                                                                                |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=386.46)  | So you can play with these in those dev tools too.                                                     |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=388.72)  | So all those are the basic shapes and ways you can write shapes.                                       |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=392.26)  | Yep.                                                                                                   |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=393.26)  | And yeah, it's so funny, past episodes come in into importance here because you're looking             |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=397.94)  | at the polygon and it's 50% 50 pixels space, zero pixels.                                              |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=402.14)  | And it might be confusing is that top or left first and it's always the horizontal first.              |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=407.46)  | It's always horizontal first.                                                                          |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=409.74)  | Anyway, just I'm like hearing you talk that out and like, ah, that's just solidifying that             |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=415.18)  | it's the consistency of CSS is so nice.                                                                |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=417.62)  | XY.                                                                                                    |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=418.62)  | All right.                                                                                             |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=419.62)  | You can make vienen types than this, flat down one type two types.                                     |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=448.48)  | acceptance an image just know secretly in your mind you're like, ooh, I could put a URL there          |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=453.84)  | to an image or to an inline, you know, a kind of element or to a gradient. So this shape is unique     |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=458.8)   | compared to the other two because it's not binary like the others, right? There's shades of gray.      |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=464.72)  | I wanted to say that so bad. Because yeah, there's the alpha mask. Yeah, there's alpha mask. Yeah.     |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=469.92)  | And it's and it's essentially it's superpower. So if you're wondering, do I need a mask or a clip?     |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=475.36)  | One of the biggest things you can think about is like, do I need to have a gradation between           |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=480.0)   | white and black? Or is there gray space in here that needs to be like partially masked?                |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=484.4)   | So like, the range between black and white become the signal of strength for a given mask or effect    |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=489.92)  | is the way I like to think about it. So this is how a mask can softly fade something from transparent  |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=494.64)  | to opaque. That is not something a basic shape can do. It can reveal something by animating the box,   |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=501.6)   | you know, it's almost like a little viewport is being animated. But this is much more soft and         |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=506.16)  | special. So gradients and images, they can be animated as well, but and create dynamic masking         |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=512.56)  | effects. And those I think they're some of the most wowing effects that you ever get is when           |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=517.2)   | people are really clever with gradients and masks and blend modes, you just the page becomes very      |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=523.36)  | lively. Anyway, I'm a big fan. The page tells a story. Yes.                                            |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=527.6)   | So let's start with clipping. With clipping, you basically keep what's inside the path,                |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=535.6)   | the clip path, and you throw away what's outside of it. So it is more that black and white, like       |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=542.16)  | visible or not. So something to note is that with a clip path, the box remains around the object.      |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=549.76)  | If you think about something like a border radius, you're sort of visually making a clip path. So if   |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=554.8)   | you set a border radius to like zero, 50 percent, zero, zero, the top right corner will have a         |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=561.92)  | rounded shape. But you're actually changing the box with the border radius. It creates like this       |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=566.96)  | exclusion area, kind of like CSS exclusions with shapes. But with clip path, the box remains around    |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=573.04)  | the object. So you still have the object take up the space that it would as a box in the box model.    |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=579.44)  | But you can do a lot of visual fun things with it, like have all your images appear in hearts          |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=584.56)  | or interesting polygons. But it's just a thing to note with clipping. Yeah, that's a good point.       |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=590.8)   | It's like visibility hidden. The box, the element that you're applying this to will definitely take    |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=595.2)   | up all of the space that its dimensions previously did. You're just visually clipping. Yeah. And yeah, |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=600.88)  | the circle is such a good one. Like I don't tend to use border radius 50 percent or 909 million        |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=606.64)  | pixels or whatever to make a circle anymore. I very much like clip path circle 50 percent. Like        |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=612.88)  | it reads exactly what I want. It's responsive to the element. Anyway, so, yeah, very, very nice        |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=619.52)  | points that you made. And with clipping also, you use math. Right. It's very math based or a           |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=624.96)  | reference to something that is very math like. Right. So you have a clip source, a basic shape         |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=629.76)  | or a geometry box. And what's nice is you can write that math in line and you can perform              |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=635.84)  | animations with that. Or you can reference an SVG by URL like URL hashtag clip. So you could have      |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=641.76)  | some, you know, hidden SVG on the page that you load and use. Anyway, it's just lots and lots of       |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=647.84)  | options to clip. Yeah. So I was going through the basic shapes earlier and I'm going to show you how   |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=653.36)  | you can use as the clip path. So the clip path property lets you create clippings of your images.      |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=661.68)  | I'm just going to use images because it's on any element. But I think the best way to think of it      |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=665.68)  | is just like, OK, you have an image of a daisy and then you want that image to sort of appear          |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=672.56)  | or disappear from the inside or outside in. You could use a clip path with inset. So that would        |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=677.2)   | be like the inset rectangle. And this is really useful for animation because you could do something    |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=682.32)  | like clip path inset 100 percent and then transition or animate that to clip path inset zero.          |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=689.04)  | And it'll do like an inside out effect to make the image appear because you're removing the inset      |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=694.4)   | clip, you're removing the clipping to make the image fully appear. So it's kind of like a way to       |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=699.28)  | make it open up. You could do like an inset of 50 percent and that would create a rectangle that       |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=704.32)  | comes in at 50 percent of the full size. So you could do a bunch of different things for inset.        |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=708.8)   | Another thing you can use this for is like hover focus effects. If you wanted to like                  |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=713.52)  | do some kind of zhuzh or page transitions, things like that. Lots of things you could do.              |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=718.0)   | Oh, do you ever, there's like a cinematic transition that movies always do where you're                |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=722.16)  | in 16 by nine and then they're like, and then they'll like go to full screen, you know, and like       |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=727.68)  | the tops and the bottom black bars disappears, like they reveal the whole image. Anyway, you           |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=732.24)  | could totally do that with inset. Are you talking about like a Wes Anderson effect?                    |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=736.0)   | Maybe. Yeah, it's just like, it's like they go to 16 by nine or maybe even tighter,                    |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=740.48)  | like a really wide screen so that they're like, oh, yeah, it's really cinematic. But then as           |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=745.6)   | the like it sets into the reality, they're going to fill your screen with pixels and then they         |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=749.12)  | transition. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, a little bit. Like you could think of it           |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=753.68)  | kind of like that, like that would be a clip and then you're removing the clipping path.               |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=758.48)  | So the next clip path value, you can use a circle. This is another of the basic shapes.                |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=762.56)  | You set the radius and position. So if you had like clip path circle 40% at 20%, 50%,                  |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=768.64)  | this would give you a circle with a 40% radius of the parent. So just a little bit smaller than the    |
| [12:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=772.96)  | full circle size, which is at 50%. Cause if you have circle 100%, it doesn't actually show the         |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=777.6)   | circle. It just shows the full image. But if you do 80%, like the sides are clipped. So this would     |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=785.04)  | then have a circle at the left center position that would be relatively almost the full size of        |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=792.8)   | the image. And I think circle is cool because you could do like cool searchlight effects on your       |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=796.88)  | image when you move it around because it's animatable and it's just like moves. It's like              |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=801.76)  | a transformation. Yeah, that at that app position could be tracking mouse, right? So you get a mouse   |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=806.72)  | property setting custom properties that are used in a clip path circle. And now you have that          |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=810.88)  | spot. Exactly. Yes. So that property is really fun. Then there's also ellipse, which is similar        |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=816.4)   | to circle, but you have your RX and RY. So it doesn't have to be a perfect circle. There's             |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=820.0)   | polygon. You can use it to make cool shapes like diamonds or kites or octagons or any sort of thing,   |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=827.84)  | the parallelograms. And then finally there's path. So this accepts a path similar to SVG.              |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=833.6)   | And it's slightly different because of the view box. So the sizing is a little bit different.          |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=838.72)  | That's something that you will probably end up debugging if you're using like directly from SVG        |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=842.96)  | to paths. But this is also where you can get really creative. I've seen some really cool like          |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=847.36)  | splatter effects with animated clip paths. I saw this really cool thing that was a movie,              |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=853.28)  | so a video that had a clip path and it animated in and it was like a splatter effect. So you did       |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=859.2)   | like fully see the edge of the video, but it was seamless inside the page. So I think that's           |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=863.04)  | a really cool stuff that you could do. Yeah. Oh man. Yeah. So masks could do that too. Yeah.           |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=868.16)  | We'll get there that masks are kind of trippy that way, but okay, cool. Yeah. One of the things        |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=871.52)  | with animating these two is that they have to be the same. Like you can't go from an inset to a        |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=875.76)  | circle or a polygon to an ellipse. You have to say polygon to polygon. But you can make a circle       |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=881.92)  | out of a polygon. Just a lot of points. Yeah. And that's like, I think path could do something         |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=888.48)  | similar to that as well. Like it can articulate arcs and stuff. So anyway, it's just like one,         |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=893.44)  | it's like the only hindrance is that you, it can't take a six sided element and become a four sided    |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=900.0)   | element very nicely. Although I think there are JavaScript libraries that do this for you.             |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=905.44)  | This important property here is called clip rule. And that takes values of non-zero or even an odd.    |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=911.2)   | So complex paths that you could use as a clip here are closed usually, or, but they could have         |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=917.76)  | a hole in it or like negative space. Like you think like a donut and the clip rule non-zero            |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=923.12)  | even, or even or let's see non-zero or even odd lets you specify how those holes clip. So like         |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=928.8)   | a donut in the center, do you want that in or out? And if you want it to be out use even odd.          |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=936.64)  | So anyway. Yeah. This is actually really important if you're using, especially if you have any sort    |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=944.4)   | of clipping path that has space inside that is a donut's perfect example, but there are so many        |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=951.2)   | more too. Yeah. I wonder if the word is like intersection, overlapping and you have these like         |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=957.92)  | inner shapes that got caused because of the way you built it. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. So there's        |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=964.56)  | also background clip. And we did talk about this a little bit in episode 34, where we talked about     |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=970.48)  | overflow, but you can set a background clip to your padding box, border box or content box,            |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=977.28)  | which is useful to make borders more visible. If you have a default just background, it's going to     |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=984.24)  | extend all the way into the borders. But if you have a border that's something like like a dotted      |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=988.96)  | border or dash border, you might not want the background to extend into that border box.               |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=994.8)   | You might want it to end up the padding box or the content box itself, which I actually recently       |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=999.84)  | played with this on using background just to the content box, because it was cool. I had like some     |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1007.12) | negative space between the content and the border by doing that. And it created like a cool effect.    |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1013.12) | So stuff to remember. And you could also use this to make cool text effects because you can set        |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1018.8)  | background clip to the text value. So you can use it to do like gradient text or cloud text or         |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1025.44) | glittery text like sparkles. And the way that you would do that is by setting a background image       |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1030.8)  | on an element that has text and then set the background clip to text and then the color                |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1037.6)  | to transparent on the text itself. So that way you can see through it. If it's semi-transparent,       |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1044.48) | you'll still see the background, but you'll have that color on top of it. And also for browser         |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1049.2)  | compatibility, you have to use WebKit background clip. So you'll set background clip, WebKit           |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1053.36) | background clip, color transparent, and then that's how you make like gradient text or sparkly text    |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1057.52) | or any kind of cool tie dye text. Tie dye is trendy now. Totally. Okay. That was clipping.             |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1065.2)  | And yeah, I think that was awesome. We did a great job in there. I've been using clipping              |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1069.68) | more and more. I just find it so handy. It can make for some really nice upgraded animations,          |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1075.84) | right? So you're like the box is there. Voila, the box. If you're into animation though, and if I      |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1080.64) | check your motion is okay. If I hover that box, I'm going to make some movement now. I'm going to      |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1084.8)  | reveal edges or pieces and make fun shapes. And anyway, I'm just having a blast with ClipPath.         |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1090.48) | Oh yeah, I made a site, but I think we'll mention that later. Okay. Let's talk about masking. So       |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1095.12) | these are images exclusively, right? We talked about the types. It can be a URL that points to         |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1100.0)  | some pixels, or it can be a linear gradient that will have some pixels in it. So the way that this     |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1105.84) | works in masking is black pixels are thrown away and white pixels are left unchanged. So if we're      |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1111.28) | talking about that like in or out scenario, and then all the things in between, that's how the         |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1115.76) | rules work, but you can flip it as well. And we'll talk about that. There's a mode that you can set    |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1120.8)  | that will specify which pixels you want and which pixels you don't. So that's just the default.        |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1125.52) | The image could be a black and white shape too. You could have like a bunny, like a white bunny        |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1129.92) | in a black background. It's really common in After Effects and stuff like that to make your            |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1134.32) | masks sort of like very stark like that. But I still think clipping has the advantages in most         |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1140.4)  | of the scenarios. It's always going to be sharp. And this is, again, you can get that softness. So     |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1144.4)  | it allows similar effects as clipping if you use it very like binary that way, black and white,        |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1149.92) | but it's otherwise more powerful in the way that it looks at each pixel at an individual level. So     |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1156.16) | why don't you walk us through how it's going to look at those pixels and how can we manage the         |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1160.72) | way that those pixels stretch across the box and et cetera. There's all sorts of cool stuff going      |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1164.8)  | on here. Yeah, there's some properties here that you don't get with clipping. And it's actually        |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1169.52) | very similar to background in the way that you apply masks because there's some similar properties.    |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1174.24) | So the first one is mask image. So this would be the image here. So masking is supported in all        |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1180.4)  | modern browsers, but you may need WebKit mask image for WebKit based browsers, WebKit prefix.          |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1185.12) | You can use a post CSS processor for that. And then this could be any URL. So you could have an        |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1192.16) | SVG URL, you could do like a star or a heart SVG and use that to mask, or you could have something     |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1197.36) | that has that alpha transparency. So you get some of those soft edges. So you could do like a burning  |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1203.44) | heart where the edges of the flames are softer. Ooh, sick. Burning hearts unite.                       |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1210.0)  | You could even use a linear gradient here as mask image. So you could do like a linear gradient,       |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1214.08) | like black to transparent. You'll have some of those pixel values that are sort of in between.         |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1218.72) | There's also mask repeat. So this is similar to background repeats. It describes if the mask           |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1222.8)  | is repeated or not. We have a episode on backgrounds that goes over a lot of these                     |
| [20:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1228.48) | values. And I was surprised at the similarities between backgrounds and masking as I was putting       |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1234.72) | this together. So for the mask repeat value, you could write no repeat, repeat, which is X and Y,      |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1241.76) | repeat X, repeat Y, round or space. And for more on what all these mean, definitely check out that     |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1247.92) | background episode where we talk about them. I think it's easier to comprehend it too as a             |
| [20:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1251.84) | background, but for masks, you might want the same kind of positioning. And you could do multiple      |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1257.12) | values too for horizontal and vertical. You could have space separated values. Then there's mask       |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1261.76) | position, which much like background position is where you position the mask within the element.       |
| [21:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1266.32) | Then there's mask clip, which is where the mask clips to. So does it clip to the content box,          |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1272.88) | the padding box, the border box, the margin box. Here you also have fill box, stroke box,              |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1278.64) | and view box. So you have a couple more box options for setting the clip. And this can also            |
| [21:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1284.08) | have multiple values. There is the mask origin, which is the origin of the mask, which is the same     |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1291.2)  | values as mask clip. So that's going to be the origin of the content box, padding box, border          |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1295.44) | box, margin box, fill box, stroke box, and view box. And then there's mask size, which is like         |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1302.08) | background size. So you can use a percentage for that. You could use an absolute length value. You     |
| [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1307.92) | can use the keywords contain and cover, just like background size cover and background size contain.   |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1313.2)  | You could do mask cover, mask size contain. And this can have multiple values as well.                 |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1317.84) | So then there are two mask properties that are only supported in Firefox, and that's mask mode         |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1325.36) | and mask composite. So mask mode sets whether the mask reference is defined as luminance or alpha      |
| [22:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1332.88) | mask. So the values are alpha, luminance, or mask source, or you could do inherit, default those.      |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1338.8)  | And there's mask composite, which represents the composite operation of how a current mask layers      |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1345.52) | with other masks below it. So this could be add, subtract, intersect, and exclude. That's how these    |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1351.92) | masks interact with each other. And finally, there's a shorthand for all this stuff, which is          |
| [22:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1359.04) | just mask. And that mask value is a shorthand for the mask image, mask mode, mask repeat, mask         |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1367.28) | position, mask clip, mask origin, mask size, and mask composite. There is so much untapped amazing     |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1375.36) | potential in there, like mask clip and having these like fire masks that are just on the margin box    |
| [23:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1382.0)  | and stuff. There is infinite playground CSS. Could you do like an animated GIF mask? I think you can.  |
| [23:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1391.92) | That would be dope. That would be sweet. And on a conic gradient. So you've got like this sweet,       |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1397.84) | beautiful conic gradient with this dancing flames there. Wow. You could use the Houdini paint a        |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1406.4)  | property worklet that you created with like the flame, pixel flame. Whoa, static flames.               |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1413.36) | Whoa, as a mask. And mask it. The Chromium engineers are over there like, is it going to work?         |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1419.12) | I don't know. We'll find out. Cool. Let's talk about the lesser known mask border. And this is         |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1428.24) | just like how the masks were very similar to backgrounds. Mask border is very similar to like          |
| [23:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1434.24) | a border image. And in episode 16, we do a deep down or deep break, wait, a deeper breakdown           |
| [24:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1441.2)  | of the following border features, which mask is basically just piggybacking on. But I do have a        |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1445.84) | warning here that pretty much there's no support for mask border, but it does have a predecessor       |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1450.56) | called WebKit mask box image that nearly all browsers have inherited from WebKit from back             |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1456.16) | in the day. It's old and dusty, but decently trusty. So nice. Another zinger I got in there.           |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1463.76) | All right. So let's start with mask border source. So this is kind of like a high level                |
| [24:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1466.72) | overview. I'll try to go fast since it's got support, but I don't know. It's just a little             |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1471.2)  | fuzzy. We have mask border source. So and this takes a list of images or gradients. So your            |
| [24:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1476.96) | sources for all your masks, mask border mode. This takes luminance or alpha and this will change the   |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1482.24) | blending mode. So it's like specifying you want to use transparency from the mask or the black and     |
| [24:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1487.04) | white grad values from the mask as the mode. So you could yeah, it's kind of cool. You're like,        |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1492.64) | I just want the alpha value of each pixel to be used versus the color. It's kind of cool.              |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1498.72) | Luminance is the one that uses the black and white ranges and alpha uses transparency.                 |
| [25:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1503.52) | There's also a mask border slice. So regions to fill an image. And this works kind of like margins     |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1508.32) | where it has repeating pairs. And if you want to learn more about slicing borders, we have that        |
| [25:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1512.48) | episode. We have mask border width and this takes a length for the border images. Again, four values   |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1518.56) | for each corner and it takes a list. So if you have multiple masks, you'd be using a comma and         |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1523.12) | specifying your widths that way. We have mask border outset. So this is the distance of the mask       |
| [25:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1528.64) | from the elements outside edge, which border image also has. And again, I think is another untapped    |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1533.76) | one that like border image can has this outset, right? It's just painted space. It's not actually      |
| [25:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1538.32) | pushing elements. It's just a painted extension outside of the box area. So cool. So it's outset       |
| [25:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1544.88) | instead of the inset they get from the clip. Yeah, you can have your mask grow away from your element  |
| [25:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1550.72) | or at least be sized away from your element and then clip it that way. Yeah, it's super cool.          |
| [25:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1556.24) | All right. And then we have mask border repeat. And so for each of the nine slice quadrants,           |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1560.24) | how should the image mask fit into the box and stretch repeat, repeat, X, repeat, Y, round in          |
| [26:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1564.64) | space. And so similar to what you covered earlier. And then, you know, we've got to have a shorthand   |
| [26:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1569.04) | at CSS. It's mask border. And it's similar to what you know, aligned up there. But here's a couple     |
| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1575.12) | examples. We have like mask dash border, colon URL to some cool mask, 30 stretch dash 20 pixels. And   |
| [26:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1583.84) | then the equivalent to, you know, the WebKit mask box image would be prefix WebKit mask box image      |
| [26:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1590.96) | colon URL to some cool image, 30 stretch slash 20. So it's the same syntax in both cases, just one is  |
| [26:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1597.52) | standardized and one is sort of inherited from the old days. So finally, I want to talk about          |
| [26:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1603.12) | exclusions and exclusions is what I sort of mentioned at the top of the episode, where you             |
| [26:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1608.4)  | could set a shape outside of your element. So it's no longer a box. One way to visualize this is if    |
| [26:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1617.76) | you have like an ice cream cone next to some text in an article, the ice cream cone will now allow     |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1625.28) | for the text to potentially wrap around it. So that would be with the shape outside it. So it          |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1629.44) | wraps around like the bumps of ice cream then out towards the top of the cone and then in towards the  |
| [27:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1635.04) | bottom of the cone. Tasty example. Yeah, tasty, tasty, tasty ship outside. There's a lot of cool       |
| [27:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1642.08) | stuff that you could do with shape outside. One example is the ice cream cone. Another example         |
| [27:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1648.8)  | is you can use it for maybe creating like illuminated manuscripts and you could use it to              |
| [27:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1657.92) | create interesting typographic effects within your layout, not just for images, but for any type of    |
| [27:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1666.08) | element. So you could totally go crazy with it. You can also get a shape margin with that. So          |
| [27:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1671.04) | you set the offset of what the other text is around it, how far away it is from it. So it's            |
| [27:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1677.68) | not like bumping up right against it and then a shape image threshold too. So that is kind of like     |
| [28:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1682.72) | placing how it looks inside your UI. And then there's also shape inside. This is specced,              |
| [28:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1688.08) | but there's no support for it. The issues with shape inside are similar to CSS regions in which        |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1694.08) | like what happens when it overflows? Like where does that go? What does that look like? So with        |
| [28:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1700.0)  | shape inside, there's also shape padding. So it's of the outside, it's the inside, like how things     |
| [28:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1703.84) | are padded. But you can kind of like hack around shape inside if you put together multiple             |
| [28:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1710.24) | elements that have a shape outside that surrounds some text. So it does look really weird when it      |
| [28:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1717.04) | overflows. But I, a while ago, put together this like travel poetry site and I did a bunch of CSS      |
| [28:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1726.48) | experiments on it. This is the one blend modes were only supported in like one browser. This is        |
| [28:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1730.4)  | like super, super new. It was like Chrome 40 or something. So anyway, with shape inside,               |
| [28:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1738.96) | you can't do it, but you could like, I used four triangles and I surrounded a block to kind of make    |
| [29:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1745.68) | like a diamond shaped text area so that the text flowed like from the top thinnest part all the        |
| [29:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1752.72) | way to the widest part, back down to the thinnest part. So you could do things like that and kind      |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1756.24) | of like hack it, play with it. Yeah. It's like your ice cream cone example where we had one side       |
| [29:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1761.92) | that the text was like flowing against. It's almost like add a second layer of text. So                |
| [29:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1767.52) | like add a second ice cream cone to the other side of the text. And you're like, really? And so now    |
| [29:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1773.44) | now the text is, you know, contextually not touching either cone. And then what you just               |
| [29:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1779.04) | described as you're like, well, yeah, well I made four of them and I turned it into a diamond          |
| [29:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1783.12) | and you had text and a diamond and that demo is really cool again. I think it looks nice.              |
| [29:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1786.56) | Thank you. That was really fun to put together. I have an experimental one to talk about just          |
| [29:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1791.36) | really quickly and this is called shape. And this is something that you could put in click path. And   |
| [29:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1795.68) | it, the reason it's different and it's not just like path is that the shape function defines a         |
| [30:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1800.56) | path very similar to how path does, but it does so with more standard CSS syntax and less of an SVG    |
| [30:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1806.8)  | syntax, which allows the full range of CSS functionality, such as relative units, you know,            |
| [30:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1813.68) | REM and M's and stuff inside of your clip paths and math functions. So you could do all the cool       |
| [30:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1820.0)  | calc work that you want to do inside of a shape and have something be really, really, you know,        |
| [30:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1824.72) | relative to the box that it's inside of, but there's no support for that. So it's spec'd and           |
| [30:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1829.2)  | it looks great, but we just got path and clip path. So it might be a while before we get shape.        |
| [30:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1833.76) | Yeah. We just got path for clip path, but that enables us to do a lot of cool transitions and          |
| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1838.64) | stuff. Sure does. Are you setting up my site? I am. I want you to tell the people. I would like        |
| [30:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1845.6)  | to pitch, I made a site called transitions.style, transition.style. And it's essentially, okay,        |
| [30:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1852.08) | think the inset clip path that we were talking about, right? We've got a box and let's say you         |
| [30:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1856.72) | want to do a wipe animation where like you don't see anything, but then the image just sort of         |
| [31:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1861.44) | wipes in. This is classic, you know, Photoshop stuff. I've got all of those pre-made for you on        |
| [31:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1867.68) | a site. And what you do is you visit the site and you look at, do you want to transition in or         |
| [31:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1871.84) | transition out? You'll find wipe in and wipe out or there like wipe from bottom, wipe from right.      |
| [31:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1876.8)  | And I've essentially just written all these clip path transitions for you. So you can do               |
| [31:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1881.52) | a lot of transitions for you. So you click one, it'll be in your clipboard and you go paste it         |
| [31:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1886.24) | somewhere. There's also a CSS library that you can import and get custom properties for. And           |
| [31:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1891.68) | anyway, it's very malleable, super fun and can bring a lot of like interesting reveals. Well,          |
| [31:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1896.72) | transitions, it helps you transition elements around. There's like a full page, like swipey.           |
| [31:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1902.16) | Swipe. Or any element. It doesn't have to be full page. It could be like one into the other or have    |
| [31:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1908.0)  | it here, not even a transition per se. Absolutely. It's an entrance or an exit. I really want to do    |
| [31:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1913.36) | a scroll snap point, a scroll timeline clip path demo where you're sort of scrolling and it's a        |
| [32:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1920.64) | different clip path transition each time you scroll. So the scroll powers the transition and           |
| [32:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1926.48) | the transitions always snaps. So you're always getting these really nice. Anyway, it's an idea         |
| [32:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1930.88) | I've had for months. I just need to go build it or someone build it and tweet us with the hashtag      |
| [32:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EhdwEHCBeg0qB5ilqf5Ys?&t=1934.72) | CSTorybook. Yes, build it. Do some cool transition stuff with clipping and masking and shapes and      |
