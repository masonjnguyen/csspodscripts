| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility                    |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=16.92)   | to z-index.                                                                                              |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=18.46)   | This is our season one wrap up episode.                                                                  |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=20.44)   | So we're going to be going over what we discussed in this past season, all 24 episodes, and              |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=26.6)    | talk about some of our favorite or most memorable tips and tricks.                                       |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=29.9)    | Surrounding the topics that we discussed, Adam, I can't believe that we're already here                  |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=34.44)   | at episode 25 at the end of our first season.                                                            |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=37.08)   | I'm trying not to cry and everyone in the audience, it's okay if you need to cry, will                   |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=42.56)   | return and it might just be better than it was the first time.                                           |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=47.58)   | But yes, this is bittersweet.                                                                            |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=48.9)    | It's bittersweet.                                                                                        |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=49.9)    | We're going to try to end with more sweet than bitter, but yeah, I'm excited.                            |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=52.84)   | Yeah, I think this will be a good episode because it's just going to be rapid fire,                      |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=55.84)   | the topics we covered, and then one to two things that we both sort of thought stood                     |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=59.5)    | out from the episodes.                                                                                   |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=61.6)    | So I'm going to start with our first episode, which was about the CSS box model.                         |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=65.82)   | And one of my favorite things about this episode is we covered all the aspects of the box model,         |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=69.72)   | how it works, and we talked about it in terms of a gallery, like a photo gallery metaphor.               |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=75.36)   | So we kind of talked about like the content being like a photograph and then the padding                 |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=80.04)   | on that content would be like a photo mat.                                                               |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=82.42)   | So you're still within the frame, but it's a photo mat, the padding.                                     |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=85.6)    | And then we talked about the border of that being the frame that's outside of that, pulling              |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=89.28)   | it together because the border does take up geometric space on the page.                                 |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=93.42)   | And then we talked about the margin around that being the distance between one photograph                |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=98.62)   | to the next.                                                                                             |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=99.76)   | And we talked about margin collapse in another episode.                                                  |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=101.8)   | We'll talk about that a little bit later in this show.                                                   |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=104.24)  | And it all kind of makes sense with this metaphor.                                                       |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=105.76)  | And then shadows, which don't take up space in the page, but they are physically painted                 |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=110.76)  | in the existing space would be a shadow from a light that's sort of shining on there.                    |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=115.16)  | So I thought that this is a really good metaphor for the CSS box model in real life.                     |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=118.88)  | I agree.                                                                                                 |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=119.88)  | And you illuminated it really well there talking about the shadows being painted.                        |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=123.64)  | And I remember that episode going, where does scroll bars go in the box model?                           |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=128.72)  | I was like, I'm supposed to know this and I do not know.                                                 |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=132.88)  | And that was really fun to go research.                                                                  |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=133.88)  | Yeah, just to figure out where did the scroll bars go.                                                   |
| [02:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=137.0)   | And again, I agree with the gallery.                                                                     |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=138.72)  | We couldn't remember photo mat.                                                                          |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=140.0)   | We had to have our audio crew that was with us.                                                          |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=142.26)  | They sent us their SOS and said, photo mat, y'all, you're supposed to be the smart ones                  |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=146.06)  | in the room.                                                                                             |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=147.06)  | We were answering your questions.                                                                        |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=149.12)  | But yeah, it was like box dimensions versus box decorations.                                             |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=154.04)  | That was so cool.                                                                                        |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=155.04)  | That was a great episode.                                                                                |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=156.04)  | What a good starter.                                                                                     |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=157.16)  | We went from there into selectors and selectors were like another one where we thought it                |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=162.76)  | would go quick.                                                                                          |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=163.94)  | And it turns out there's just a whole bunch of stuff in here, like compound versus complex.              |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=168.64)  | We had combinators and skeletaurs.                                                                       |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=170.36)  | Hey wait, that's not a CSS selector, but what do you remember from this episode?                         |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=174.84)  | That's what you called it in the beginning.                                                              |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=175.84)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=176.84)  | We also talked about some cool little tips and tricks that you can do with selectors.                    |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=180.6)   | With the attribute selector, you could do a href equals and then a hash.                                 |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=185.16)  | So you can do some HTML linting for anything that was a hash instead of an actual link                   |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=191.56)  | to make sure that you had filled out your links for your site and didn't launch something                |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=195.0)   | with blank links.                                                                                        |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=196.84)  | So there's a lot of cool things you can do.                                                              |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=198.6)   | Adjacent sibling selectors and just generally sibling selectors.                                         |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=201.16)  | The general sibling selectors, another one, I thought were really interesting and something              |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=205.6)   | that I use all the time.                                                                                 |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=206.6)   | This is like something like the greater than sign or the plus sign or the curly brace.                   |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=211.4)   | And for more of that, listen to episode two on selectors.                                                |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=214.48)  | After our selector episode, we jumped into specificity and we played a really fun game                   |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=219.28)  | during this episode calculating specificity.                                                             |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=222.68)  | So we kind of went over that the universal selector was zero.                                            |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=226.08)  | Yeah, we went over that elements were one point each.                                                    |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=229.72)  | Classes and pseudo classes are 10 points each.                                                           |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=232.52)  | So a way that you can now start thinking about this is if you had like a scoreboard and in               |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=236.68)  | that ones place, like elements would tick up, how many elements you had and then how                     |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=240.16)  | many classes or pseudo classes you had would tick up that second from the right most spot.               |
| [04:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=244.64)  | So that would be like the 10 points and that would start ticking up.                                     |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=247.04)  | I think that's like a good way to think of it.                                                           |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=248.2)   | I keep thinking of this like what's the one in Harry Potter where they're flying around                  |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=252.08)  | on brooms?                                                                                               |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=253.08)  | That's Quidditch, right?                                                                                 |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=254.08)  | Yes, it's Quidditch.                                                                                     |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=255.08)  | It's just like that because right, you score one point with a ball and it's worth one point,             |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=258.04)  | but you can score six points and it's still of that one score type, it's only one point.                 |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=262.02)  | But there's a different score type and there's another score type, there's even Catch in                 |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=265.32)  | the Snitch, which is kind of like inlining CSS or writing a lot of IDs because there's                   |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=269.92)  | such high scores.                                                                                        |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=270.92)  | They're like snitch points.                                                                              |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=272.04)  | But yes, that was really fun, that game.                                                                 |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=274.4)   | Yeah, so then IDs were 100 points and inline is 1000 points and then important just overrides            |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=280.26)  | it all.                                                                                                  |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=281.26)  | So we went through all that and had a little audience participation moment.                              |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=285.34)  | So check that episode out too.                                                                           |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=286.78)  | I think the most impressive part of that episode was that we didn't say specificity wrong one            |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=291.44)  | time and there's another episode.                                                                        |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=293.2)   | I don't know about that.                                                                                 |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=294.2)   | Really?                                                                                                  |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=295.2)   | I don't know.                                                                                            |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=296.2)   | I don't remember.                                                                                        |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=297.42)  | That's a hard word to say and I felt like we did really good.                                            |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=300.48)  | There's another podcast I listened to where they just can't say it once and it's hilarious.              |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=304.76)  | And so specificity, specificity, specificity, did it.                                                    |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=308.44)  | You heard it here.                                                                                       |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=309.84)  | Look at you.                                                                                             |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=312.04)  | I'm glad that worked out well.                                                                           |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=313.12)  | What was next, Adam?                                                                                     |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=314.12)  | Yeah, what's next is the cascade.                                                                        |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=316.08)  | And the cascade, well, we learned that many rules and many styles enter into the cascade,                |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=321.22)  | but only one will win at the end of the day when it goes to paint that item.                             |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=325.12)  | And so we learned like how do they compete?                                                              |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=326.8)   | How do they compete to style?                                                                            |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=328.44)  | And what does the browser do when there's nothing there?                                                 |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=330.96)  | Right?                                                                                                   |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=331.96)  | Hey, you didn't tell me what color this text should be.                                                  |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=334.44)  | What color shall I make this text?                                                                       |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=335.88)  | And so we learned what initial verse inherit versus unset were.                                          |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=339.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=340.72)  | What do you remember about the cascade episode?                                                          |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=341.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=342.92)  | So we chatted about cascade origins.                                                                     |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=344.28)  | I think that the best way to remember it is thinking about it in terms of three origins.                 |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=348.2)   | It's your user agent.                                                                                    |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=349.4)   | So your browser style sheet.                                                                             |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=351.16)  | There's the author style.                                                                                |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=352.16)  | So that's the code that the website author writes, the developer writes.                                 |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=356.36)  | And then there's local user style.                                                                       |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=357.66)  | So those are sort of overrides or anything that the user has added onto the site.                        |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=361.88)  | And the way that they are ordered from least to most specific starts with the user agent                 |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=366.48)  | space style sheet.                                                                                       |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=367.48)  | That's the least specific.                                                                               |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=369.16)  | Then it's the local user space style sheets, then the author style space style sheet.                    |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=374.5)   | So that is more specific than the local user space.                                                      |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=377.32)  | And then more specific than that is the author styles with important tags.                               |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=382.6)   | But even more specific than that is the local user style with important tags.                            |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=387.56)  | And the trump card of all of this is the user agent's important tags.                                    |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=393.12)  | That overrides everything in terms of specificity.                                                       |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=395.28)  | Very well done.                                                                                          |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=396.28)  | Who would have thought that importance could even battle, right?                                         |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=398.44)  | And you need to know what that stack is so you can score it.                                             |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=401.0)   | I remember too talking about origins, like we had where did the styles come from?                        |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=405.94)  | And we talked about it's like the website, the client can have them.                                     |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=410.2)   | There's like multiple origins, but there's a new one that kind of is being chatted about                 |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=413.88)  | recently it's called a layer.                                                                            |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=415.48)  | And so watch out for a future episode about layers as we talk about the cascade getting                  |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=420.0)   | a new origin.                                                                                            |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=421.0)   | So cool.                                                                                                 |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=422.0)   | Potentially, it is a I wouldn't call it a draft yet.                                                     |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=425.56)  | It is a point of discussion in the CSS Working Group.                                                    |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=428.2)   | So it's true.                                                                                            |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=429.2)   | We'll see what happens in the future.                                                                    |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=431.16)  | Good call.                                                                                               |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=432.16)  | Good call.                                                                                               |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=433.16)  | So next we have inheritance.                                                                             |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=434.16)  | This is episode five and this is a subject that can be pretty tricky.                                    |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=437.12)  | So we discussed which properties inherit values from their parents, like the color property              |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=442.4)   | and which ones don't.                                                                                    |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=443.4)   | We sort of went through the list of inherited properties.                                                |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=445.76)  | Oh, this is like, okay, so I just described some of the inheritance fun features in the                  |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=450.24)  | last one we talked about the cascade.                                                                    |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=452.16)  | So when I said, what does the browser do when there's nothing there and initial versus onset,            |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=456.8)   | these were things I meant to comment on this inheritance episode, not on the cascade.                    |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=461.72)  | But anyway,                                                                                              |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=462.72)  | They're similar but different.                                                                           |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=463.72)  | It's actually good that you brought that up because I think people do mix these two up,                  |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=468.48)  | the cascade inheritance and we tried to separate them in each podcast episode.                           |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=472.64)  | Yeah, yeah, good call.                                                                                   |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=473.64)  | It is.                                                                                                   |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=474.64)  | You know what?                                                                                           |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=475.64)  | I did that on purpose.                                                                                   |
| [07:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=476.64)  | I did that to prove a lesson.                                                                            |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=477.64)  | Show how close they are.                                                                                 |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=480.16)  | All right.                                                                                               |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=481.16)  | Next, though, after inheritance.                                                                         |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=482.16)  | Wait, did you have an inherited stuff you want to talk about?                                            |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=483.72)  | Because all I did was say sorry.                                                                         |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=485.16)  | No, I mean, I just went over the episode.                                                                |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=487.56)  | Right on.                                                                                                |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=488.56)  | All right.                                                                                               |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=489.56)  | So color part one was our next episode.                                                                  |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=490.56)  | So we're on episode six now.                                                                             |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=491.84)  | I don't know if anyone's counting.                                                                       |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=492.88)  | We've gone through five, we're on six.                                                                   |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=494.62)  | Color part one was a two parter.                                                                         |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=496.44)  | And the first part was all about just like understanding color syntax.                                   |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=500.04)  | What's today's state of the color?                                                                       |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=501.92)  | And then the part two was all about perceptual color and like humans in color in the future              |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=505.98)  | of color.                                                                                                |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=506.98)  | So color part one, I mostly remember talking about types for the first time.                             |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=511.12)  | It's like a really prominent concept for us to bring into CSS podcast was types and just                 |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=515.88)  | the color type.                                                                                          |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=516.88)  | And then the functional notation syntax, which I'm a huge fan of and use all the time.                   |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=521.02)  | And we got to tell you all about it on this episode.                                                     |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=523.52)  | What do you remember about color part one?                                                               |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=525.08)  | I remember talking about commas versus no commas for the functional notation syntax.                     |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=531.3)   | But yeah, I think this is really valuable if you're working with color on the web, because               |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=533.68)  | we talk about what like HSL versus RGB was.                                                              |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=536.84)  | And one of my favorite things is we did this web almanac survey last year.                               |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=541.84)  | And as a part of that, we found some really fun facts about the web.                                     |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=544.4)   | And one of them was that most web pages have over 100 unique colors on them.                             |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=548.12)  | I thought that was really interesting.                                                                   |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=549.96)  | And then we looked at some HTTP archive data.                                                            |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=552.16)  | And we found that like the color gray is one of the most popularly used colors.                          |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=556.48)  | But gray with the GRAY spelling has twice the popularity of GREY, which I thought was                    |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=562.84)  | really funny and interesting because they're both aliases you can use either.                            |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=566.0)   | But it was just like a little funny color nerd fact that I thought was cool.                             |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=570.38)  | And then after that, we talked about color perception in the second episode.                             |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=574.04)  | And here, we moved on from HSL and RGB and talked about LCH, which is something that                     |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=580.0)   | involves chroma.                                                                                         |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=581.12)  | So it's lightness, chroma, hue, and then lab color as well.                                              |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=584.64)  | And these both have a wider color gamut.                                                                 |
| [09:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=587.14)  | They take into account how humans perceive color to send uniform information tones across                |

| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=593.24)  | So that way, your brand color will look the same on a computer monitor in someone's car,                 |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=598.72)  | on a mobile device anywhere, because it's really hard to do that right now.                              |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=603.52)  | Yeah, that's a good segue into one of my favorite things we talked about in this episode, too,           |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=607.2)   | which was device independent color and device dependent color.                                           |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=610.68)  | So it's like in some ways, we want the device to control the color like printing.                        |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=614.68)  | So we have CMYK and everyone gets the same blue because now we have a common way to show                 |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=619.72)  | that color on paper.                                                                                     |
| [10:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=621.12)  | But with a screen, and we have all these different types of screens, now we can specify a color          |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=625.42)  | in a device independent way using LCH and lab.                                                           |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=628.54)  | And we kind of get these new powers in addition to the perceptual benefits that come with                |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=632.68)  | being this like human oriented syntax.                                                                   |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=635.48)  | It's really nice.                                                                                        |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=636.48)  | I remember talking about gamuts, too, you know, Captain Metaphor over here, and I was                    |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=640.04)  | like, oh, one gamut that's like you only see some colors like an old projector, it might                 |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=644.36)  | be like a golf ball.                                                                                     |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=645.6)   | But then if you're in the future on a high quality screen, it might be like a volleyball                 |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=649.28)  | or beach ball of color.                                                                                  |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=651.08)  | And I like thinking about gamuts as almost like this thing you could hold because it                     |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=654.36)  | was how many colors was the device even capable of showing.                                              |
| [10:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=657.92)  | And yeah, you shared in that episode that 8% of biological males have colorblindness.                    |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=661.94)  | And I was like, oh, does that mean is it my friends?                                                     |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=664.6)   | Which one of us has it?                                                                                  |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=665.88)  | Someone's got it.                                                                                        |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=666.88)  | And then I'm really excited.                                                                             |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=668.6)   | I'm assuming 2021 is going to be the year of the color function.                                         |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=672.64)  | And I mean that like color parentheses where you can like pass the color space you want                  |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=676.16)  | to use it in.                                                                                            |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=677.16)  | Apple's already got it in WebKit.                                                                        |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=678.84)  | So I'm assuming 2021 we're going to start writing colors with not just the functional                    |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=683.76)  | HSL or LCH color notation, we're going to be putting functions inside of functions inside                |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=688.58)  | of functions.                                                                                            |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=689.76)  | Functions on the right hand side of that property value pair.                                            |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=692.36)  | Yep.                                                                                                     |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=693.36)  | I am looking forward to it.                                                                              |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=694.76)  | All right.                                                                                               |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=695.76)  | Next was sizing units.                                                                                   |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=697.22)  | And I've been very familiar with this one.                                                               |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=698.96)  | I remember all the stuff in here, especially the design tools were lacking so many of the                |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=704.44)  | units.                                                                                                   |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=705.44)  | So it's like you have, I am a web design tool to help web designers make web stuff.                      |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=709.0)   | And then you're like, cool.                                                                              |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=710.0)   | Can I use an M and a REM?                                                                                |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=711.0)   | And they're like, no.                                                                                    |

| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=713.52)  | Why M's and REM's are cool.                                                                              |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=715.0)   | Well, I guess they don't know what the baseline font sizes or the parent font.                           |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=719.48)  | I guess, you know, the parent font size though.                                                          |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=721.08)  | They could just let people pick it.                                                                      |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=722.38)  | It's not like the design tool.                                                                           |

| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=724.38)  | It depends if it's web flow or Figma.                                                                    |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=725.38)  | But yeah, anyway, I just remember like there's so many different types.                                  |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=728.2)   | The Q unit really blew my mind.                                                                          |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=730.42)  | And then just having like relative versus absolute was a really important thing to think                 |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=735.02)  | about.                                                                                                   |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=736.02)  | Like, what is this unit?                                                                                 |

| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=739.32)  | Is it anyway?                                                                                            |

| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=751.04)  | But then with CH, it's a character length that's based on the number zero.                               |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=755.24)  | And I've actually been using this a lot ever since as a width value.                                     |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=759.32)  | And you can use it with like min or max functions or with clamp to retain a readable size for            |

| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=765.16)  | So if the minimum size is like 23 characters and the maximum size is 46 characters, at                   |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=770.02)  | least based on that like zero glyph, then you have a somewhat readable paragraph.                        |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=774.44)  | So it doesn't get like too wide or too narrow at any point.                                              |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=777.2)   | And you can sort of clamp that size.                                                                     |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=779.28)  | So I found that super useful.                                                                            |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=781.64)  | And I also learned about radians and gradients, rad and grad units, which are also very nice             |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=786.28)  | to use with HSL values.                                                                                  |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=787.72)  | I usually just set an HSL value from zero to 255.                                                        |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=793.2)   | I didn't really think, oh, zero to two, is it zero to 360 for the hue?                                   |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=798.16)  | Yeah, it's like a clock.                                                                                 |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=799.16)  | Because you can use degrees.                                                                             |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=800.6)   | You can use the degrees.                                                                                 |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=802.06)  | But then for like RGB, it's zero to 55.                                                                  |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=806.18)  | So yeah, I feel like with HSL, specifically radians and gradients are awesome to use.                    |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=812.0)   | So I wanted to like break out of my degree mindset.                                                      |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=814.96)  | And also for kind of gradients positioning, you can use this value in a lot of ways.                     |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=819.88)  | So that sizing unit was super cool to see.                                                               |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=824.4)   | And also to just put it into context.                                                                    |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=826.16)  | Yeah, lots of superpowers just in like understanding your units or the dimensions.                       |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=831.12)  | I think they were called like dimensions in the spec.                                                    |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=832.96)  | We're like, we're entering a new dimension in this episode.                                              |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=835.64)  | Four inches.                                                                                             |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=836.64)  | Yeah, right.                                                                                             |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=837.64)  | And also, yeah, you have inches.                                                                         |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=839.52)  | And like print styles are so common on the web that we sort of forget about that.                        |
| [14:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=843.12)  | But I feel like a lot of websites have intention to be printed, a lot of new sites.                      |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=847.96)  | And you have totally the ability to style print with physical units.                                     |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=852.12)  | So you can like have a printable ruler and stuff.                                                        |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=854.36)  | It's all totally possible on CSF.                                                                        |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=855.98)  | So cool.                                                                                                 |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=856.98)  | Very cool.                                                                                               |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=857.98)  | So after sizing units, we talked about layout.                                                           |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=859.6)   | And that was episode number nine.                                                                        |
| [14:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=861.52)  | And here we covered a wide array of topics on this specific episode.                                     |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=865.4)   | And I will say that with both Grid and Flexbox, my favorite techniques are using them in a               |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=871.44)  | responsive way.                                                                                          |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=872.82)  | So that means like setting responsive columns using CSS functions and using place items                  |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=877.44)  | center or place content center to perfectly center content.                                              |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=881.2)   | And like here, I sort of prefer Grid for that because Grid is both horizontal and vertical               |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=885.92)  | whereas Flexbox is just a horizontal layout.                                                             |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=888.2)   | But there's so much that you can do with layout.                                                         |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=890.72)  | And we did like this really big overview show on layout as episode number nine before we                 |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=895.36)  | dove into episode number 10 and 11, which is focusing on Flexbox and Grid.                               |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=899.32)  | Yeah, it was like we had tried to do these little episodes that were pinpointed and targeted             |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=904.2)   | about a topic, but layout was so huge.                                                                   |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=906.2)   | We were like, okay, we're just going to have to cover all of it briefly and then dive into               |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=911.0)   | some specifically.                                                                                       |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=912.0)   | And it ended up being a sort of theme we carried out in a couple other use cases.                        |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=917.0)   | Like spacing, right?                                                                                     |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=918.0)   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=919.0)   | We had to do it in one, so we couldn't necessarily always jump right into the like nitty gritty,         |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=924.32)  | super robust edge cases of something.                                                                    |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=926.56)  | So we had to like slowly work folks into different concepts and layout was a really great place          |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=931.26)  | where we got to do this macro view and cover the bird's eye view of what you could do on                 |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=935.76)  | the web.                                                                                                 |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=936.76)  | And that moved us into Flexbox eventually where I remember talking about Zoro slicing                    |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=941.88)  | inline and block axes where I was trying to think, I was like, okay, like a dwarf with                   |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=947.24)  | a battle axe is definitely striking the block access.                                                    |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=950.04)  | Like he swings over his head down towards his feet and that's in Latin, that's the block                 |
| [15:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=954.82)  | access.                                                                                                  |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=955.82)  | And then you have Zoro who's slicing like from left to right, like shing.                                |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=958.84)  | And that's the inline access.                                                                            |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=960.0)   | And I remember thinking it was nerdy and fun.                                                            |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=962.52)  | I remember talking about gap.                                                                            |
| [16:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=964.4)   | I was excited then I'm still excited about gap.                                                          |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=966.4)   | Gap is out.                                                                                              |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=967.4)   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| [16:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=968.4)   | And then flex shrink zero is like shrink wrapping content.                                               |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=971.2)   | So now I think about every time it's like I have a Flexbox and let's say it's got like                   |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=975.14)  | Cheetos inside of a box.                                                                                 |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=977.16)  | And then I'm like flex shrink zero and it goes, and it turns into, you know, just like                   |
| [16:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=982.36)  | makes it as small as it can.                                                                             |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=983.64)  | So anyway, fun thoughts from Adam on Flexbox.                                                            |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=986.24)  | What about you, Yuna?                                                                                    |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=987.24)  | What you got?                                                                                            |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=988.24)  | I thought that the discussion on justification was a really important topic to get a handle              |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=992.48)  | on when it comes to flex and grid and specifically with Flexbox because all these justification          |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=996.88)  | properties came out with Flexbox.                                                                        |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=999.36)  | So I think that we did a pretty good job of covering that in the show.                                   |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1003.08) | And like justification is how you space items horizontally based on each other.                          |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1009.6)  | So that could be like space around or space between space evenly center.                                 |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1013.36) | So you would center everything within the parent.                                                        |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1015.68) | Flex start would be at the start or flex end would be at the end.                                        |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1018.96) | And this is just something I think is a really important core concept to get down.                       |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1023.08) | And I think that like this Flexbox show was a pretty good overview on that.                              |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1026.36) | It did.                                                                                                  |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1027.36) | And it sets us up well.                                                                                  |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1028.36) | So we're going to, we just finished Flexbox and then we'll get into grid and then we do                  |
| [17:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1030.9)  | logical properties.                                                                                      |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1032.08) | And what we learned is that Flexbox had been preparing us for logical properties this whole              |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1036.28) | time.                                                                                                    |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1037.28) | Right?                                                                                                   |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1038.28) | So the justification like you're talking about there is teaching us that terminology and                 |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1041.28) | getting us to align using that logical verbiage instead of a physical verbiage.                          |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1046.64) | Right?                                                                                                   |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1047.64) | We never had flex left.                                                                                  |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1048.64) | It just never existed.                                                                                   |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1050.2)  | Right.                                                                                                   |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1051.2)  | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1052.2)  | So kind of cool.                                                                                         |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1053.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1054.2)  | That's a great point.                                                                                    |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1055.2)  | So NCS is good.                                                                                          |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1056.2)  | This is a big topic.                                                                                     |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1057.2)  | A few key points and fun facts.                                                                          |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1058.2)  | As I mentioned earlier, grid is both horizontal and vertical layouts, which is why I prefer              |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1062.12) | to use that for place items.                                                                             |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1064.36) | And it just gives you so much control over your layouts.                                                 |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1067.2)  | I really like min content and max content as a unit of measure, which is just based                      |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1073.06) | on intrinsic size of the content within it.                                                              |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1075.76) | And we also talked about some really handy functions like the min max and fit content                    |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1080.2)  | function.                                                                                                |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1081.2)  | Min max basically allows for you to write column sizes that are greater than or equal                    |
| [18:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1085.68) | to the minimum content size or less than or equal to the maximum content size.                           |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1090.2)  | And then for fit content, you have the min max with auto and then max content.                           |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1095.02) | So there's a lot of really great functions that came out with grid that allow us to have                 |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1099.24) | a lot of robust control over our grid layouts.                                                           |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1102.7)  | And it's just such a really interesting big topic that helps with so much on the web layout              |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1108.2)  | and styling specifically like macro and micro layouts and identifying those between those                |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1113.44) | I think is a piece of CSS that a lot of people struggle with.                                            |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1116.4)  | So with Flexbox and grid, we have just so many tools at our disposal to help us get                      |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1121.12) | our layout sort of in check.                                                                             |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1122.48) | Yeah, it's really rad.                                                                                   |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1123.52) | I'm really excited you brought up the functions too.                                                     |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1125.68) | I remember being blown away at so again, I guess, am I really that big of a functional                   |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1130.22) | programming nerd?                                                                                        |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1131.22) | I must be anyway.                                                                                        |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1132.3)  | So with the min max functions, right, we have min and max, and then we have min max, and                 |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1137.16) | then we had fit content.                                                                                 |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1138.64) | And we had all these different ones.                                                                     |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1139.88) | And as that episode unveiled, we learned that the sort of handier functions were just made               |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1145.16) | up of the smaller ones.                                                                                  |
| [19:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1146.68) | And that min and max, like clamp is just made of min and max.                                            |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1149.76) | And so what you have is functional composition as CSS is sort of creating these primitives               |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1155.18) | that allow it to scale and do more complex things over time.                                             |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1159.16) | And it's just amazing.                                                                                   |
| [19:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1160.16) | I'm amazed at how cool the functional pure function composition is.                                      |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1163.52) | It's very nice.                                                                                          |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1164.52) | Yeah, it's evolved so much.                                                                              |
| [19:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1165.8)  | It's evolved so much.                                                                                    |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1166.8)  | It's really cool to see and it's just growing and building on top of its own functions.                  |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1170.68) | Like you said, some primitives.                                                                          |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1171.68) | So it's cool.                                                                                            |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1172.68) | Super rad.                                                                                               |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1173.68) | So that played in well to logical properties, which might be my season favorite topic.                   |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1179.88) | I mean, that's a really hard thing to say, but I just love logical properties.                           |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1184.28) | I love relative flow.                                                                                    |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1185.84) | Now I like thinking about logical versus physical.                                                       |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1189.32) | And I think the future is all logical properties.                                                        |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1192.42) | I think we will see physical properties just sort of maybe be niche as logical is just                   |
| [19:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1198.16) | the reasonable way to move forward.                                                                      |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1200.4)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1201.4)  | What did you remember about logical properties?                                                          |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1202.4)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1203.4)  | And for those of you who haven't listened to the show yet, logical properties allow                      |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1205.92) | for us to write things in terms of general directions instead of left, right, top, bottom.               |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1212.4)  | And that allows for when you have a directional change in language.                                      |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1216.64) | So say your user is now reading something in Hebrew or Arabic, it's going right to left                  |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1220.52) | instead of left to right, or like in some Japanese typefaces, there could be a vertical                  |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1225.68) | component there where it's going from vertical and then from right to left.                              |
| [20:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1229.58) | So when you write things in logical properties, you don't have to do the work of rejiggering             |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1233.52) | that per layout and your users don't have broken layouts.                                                |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1236.24) | It just automatically does that.                                                                         |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1238.2)  | And I think that's cool.                                                                                 |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1239.2)  | But then I also love that we talked about these shorthands like margin inline block                      |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1242.72) | is impossible instead of separating that into like margin left and margin right.                         |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1246.54) | So there's some really great gems in there.                                                              |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1248.84) | And I also want to add that there is a really good post CSS polyfill.                                    |
| [20:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1254.22) | So if you're thinking, oh, I can't use logical properties because I have to support IE 11.               |
| [21:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1260.38) | There's a polyfill, you can use post CSS, it converts things into direction.                             |
| [21:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1264.48) | So it uses the direction attribute in CSS to then apply these styles.                                    |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1268.96) | So it's totally possible to do.                                                                          |
| [21:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1270.66) | It's just a mindset switch.                                                                              |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1272.06) | It's a terminology switch.                                                                               |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1273.52) | And as Adam said, I think it's just the future.                                                          |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1275.36) | I did a weird little test just yesterday with logical properties and ch units like we were               |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1280.84) | just talking about.                                                                                      |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1281.84) | Follow along, I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but I thought it's really interesting.         |
| [21:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1285.08) | Okay, we're talking about the max character reading width of a paragraph, right?                         |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1288.56) | You were mentioning that earlier, you know, 40, 50 ch or whatever seems to be pretty common              |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1292.9)  | for me for like a paragraph tag.                                                                         |
| [21:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1294.78) | And so I'm using logical properties, I'm saying max inline size 40 ch.                                   |
| [21:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1300.84) | What I discovered is that when I translate that to traditional Chinese, where my display                 |
| [21:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1307.76) | inline is now a new direction and I'm using the same ch, but it's a new font, right?                     |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1314.54) | So here's what I tested.                                                                                 |
| [21:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1316.46) | Is 40 ch, which is Latin's pretty much decided or whatever, we know what it is in Latin,                 |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1322.48) | it's like between 40 and 70 characters, but do we know what it is in Chinese?                            |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1326.44) | Do we know what it is in Japanese?                                                                       |
| [22:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1327.94) | And so what I did as a quick test is I tested was it ch, x units, m units, rems or ems that              |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1334.56) | gave me a more consistent reading width just for me optically across Hebrew, Chinese and                 |
| [22:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1341.64) | Latin.                                                                                                   |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1342.64) | And I rotated all the directions and did everything that I could and watched how the ch unit essentially |
| [22:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1347.88) | won.                                                                                                     |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1348.88) | The ch unit was the most consistent in the way that it represented an optical reading                    |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1353.0)  | width in a single unit.                                                                                  |
| [22:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1354.96) | So anyway, small, maybe that was too long of a deep dive in a direction, but these things                |
| [22:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1359.84) | coming together are really cool.                                                                         |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1361.64) | We see logical properties and smart units allowing me to write one type of CSS instead                   |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1366.5)  | of four or five.                                                                                         |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1368.0)  | It's just amazing.                                                                                       |
| [22:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1369.08) | I'm constantly amazed.                                                                                   |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1370.86) | That's I think the gist.                                                                                 |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1371.9)  | Then we had a show all about spacing.                                                                    |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1374.32) | So one topic that I thought was really important that we covered here was this concept of margin         |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1378.34) | collapse.                                                                                                |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1379.34) | And this is when you have two adjacent siblings, like a header followed by a paragraph or two            |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1383.44) | paragraphs following each other.                                                                         |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1385.52) | And what happens is the larger of the two margins would become the actual margin.                        |
| [23:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1390.44) | So it sort of eats the smaller margin, if you will.                                                      |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1393.84) | And this is a concept that I did not even realize for a long time, even though I had                     |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1397.96) | been coding for a while and focusing on styling, because it was just so natural to my experience         |
| [23:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1403.8)  | on the web that I didn't even think about it.                                                            |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1406.02) | But it totally makes sense.                                                                              |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1407.32) | And if you're running into issues with margin, this could be why.                                        |
| [23:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1410.76) | And then you can use clear fix elements to clear margin collapse.                                        |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1414.12) | But it was just a concept that is so obvious.                                                            |
| [23:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1416.96) | And I think I was a few years into coding before I learned what this was.                                |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1420.9)  | I'm glad you covered that too.                                                                           |
| [23:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1422.4)  | I don't think I knew fully what it was until we studied it.                                              |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1426.0)  | I think I would run into it and just patch it and run away from it until we confronted                   |
| [23:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1430.6)  | it.                                                                                                      |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1431.6)  | And I like your example of where just the larger one eats the smaller one.                               |
| [23:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1433.6)  | It's like they converge on the larger of the two.                                                        |
| [23:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1437.06) | And I think from that episode, one of my favorite ones was talking about all the awkward                 |
| [24:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1440.64) | ways that we spaced historically, like the NBSP semicolon, so the non-breaking space.                    |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1446.96) | I used to paste that all over the place or just the BR tag.                                              |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1450.8)  | I'll just add some space here with a few more BR tags.                                                   |
| [24:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1453.84) | Oh, it was three, not enough, I'll add, I'll just duplicate all three and I'll throw three               |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1457.32) | more in there and see how much space I can.                                                              |
| [24:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1459.08) | I still use that in paragraphs sometimes.                                                                |
| [24:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1462.04) | So these things, look, you don't always have to use 5CH padding.                                         |
| [24:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1467.68) | You can use a break tag.                                                                                 |
| [24:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1469.1)  | So the web is fun this way.                                                                              |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1470.56) | It's very fluid, very liquid and spacing.                                                                |
| [24:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1472.92) | We have a lot of options.                                                                                |
| [24:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1473.92) | That was a fun episode.                                                                                  |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1476.08) | That moved us on to pseudo elements.                                                                     |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1477.84) | All right.                                                                                               |
| [24:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1478.84) | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| [24:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1479.84) | So CSS has pseudo elements, pseudo selectors and pseudo classes.                                         |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1482.0)  | I think we hit pseudo classes in like the selectors episode.                                             |
| [24:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1485.26) | So this was pseudo elements.                                                                             |
| [24:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1487.44) | And what do you remember about pseudo elements?                                                          |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1488.84) | Do you have like a favorite one or a thing?                                                              |
| [24:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1490.8)  | Well, I think that the most common ones are before and after.                                            |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1493.16) | So we talked about those.                                                                                |
| [24:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1494.68) | Note there, they do require the content properties.                                                      |
| [24:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1497.32) | So if you're before and after pseudo elements aren't showing up, even though you give it                 |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1499.84) | a background and note size and a block, if you don't have content, even if it's blank,                   |
| [25:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1504.08) | it's not going to show up.                                                                               |
| [25:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1505.8)  | And we also talked about web components this episode.                                                    |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1508.28) | So we talked about part and theme, which are pseudo classes that let you sort of reach                   |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1513.16) | into the shadow DOM of web components and apply styling.                                                 |
| [25:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1517.48) | And then we start talking about like slotted parts and stuff.                                            |
| [25:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1520.4)  | Yeah, we sort of extended past CSS, but this is CSS to use within web components.                        |
| [25:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1526.04) | Yeah, we should follow up on that and do another deep dive on web components specific styling            |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1530.32) | because we've adoptable style sheets.                                                                    |
| [25:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1532.64) | We have to figure out though, like where do we cut it off with JavaScript?                               |
| [25:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1535.22) | It's hard.                                                                                               |
| [25:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1536.22) | CSS and JS have a lot that they overlap on sometimes.                                                    |
| [25:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1539.2)  | I remember backdrop being a pseudo element and marker.                                                   |
| [25:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1543.08) | So marker was one that I was kind of amazed.                                                             |
| [25:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1544.9)  | So this is like the dot or the little dash that happened on a bulleted list.                             |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1548.84) | Backdrop being the behind a modal, but learning about new ones like spelling error and grammar           |
| [25:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1554.14) | error and these sort of like future things that the browser is going to let me style                     |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1558.28) | because it's maintaining the state of these elements, but giving me an opportunity to                    |
| [26:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1562.6)  | sort of target pieces of it.                                                                             |
| [26:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1564.22) | And it's really cool.                                                                                    |
| [26:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1565.68) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [26:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1566.68) | Pseudo elements and they are two dots.                                                                   |
| [26:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1567.76) | They're the two colon one.                                                                               |
| [26:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1568.92) | So if you're wondering if it's one or two colons for the pseudo element, it is two pseudo                |
| [26:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1573.28) | selectors are the one.                                                                                   |
| [26:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1574.28) | Two colons.                                                                                              |
| [26:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1575.28) | So yeah, it leads me to pseudo selectors, which are the single colon and you can actually                |
| [26:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1580.36) | use pseudo elements with one colon too.                                                                  |
| [26:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1582.96) | It's not how you're supposed to quote unquote, but it still works.                                       |
| [26:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1586.76) | It still works.                                                                                          |
| [26:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1587.76) | It still works.                                                                                          |
| [26:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1588.76) | That's like forgetting a semi-colon too.                                                                 |
| [26:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1590.24) | You can be like, you can forget semi-colon sometimes.                                                    |
| [26:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1592.44) | It'll still work.                                                                                        |

| [26:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1594.56) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [26:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1595.56) | In CSS.                                                                                                  |
| [26:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1596.56) | Only the last one.                                                                                       |

| [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1598.56) | Only the very last one or the only one.                                                                  |
| [26:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1601.56) | So we talked about pseudo selectors next and there are a lot.                                            |
| [26:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1605.64) | I think there was like 30 that we talked about, but I just wanted to talk about some of my               |
| [26:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1609.16) | favorites on this show.                                                                                  |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1611.04) | This little recap.                                                                                       |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1612.04) | One of my favorites, Visited is one of my favorites because you can denote visited links.                |
| [26:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1616.2)  | So like on my podcast, I have a little visited style that I'm using the visited pseudo selector          |
| [27:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1621.8)  | for and I sort of show you which blog posts you have or haven't read yet.                                |
| [27:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1626.04) | I think it's like a cool little touch.                                                                   |
| [27:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1627.54) | You've been here and I know it and I'm going to show it to you with a little style.                      |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1632.24) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [27:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1633.24) | But because there's a lot of security concerns around Visited, you have a very limited list              |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1638.44) | of properties that you can style with Visited.                                                           |
| [27:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1640.8)  | So it is fun for me because it creates these constraints and I think that was cool.                      |
| [27:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1645.96) | My next favorite one is Focus Within because Focus Within fixes so many accessibility issues             |
| [27:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1651.8)  | with focus.                                                                                              |
| [27:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1652.8)  | Previously, you could apply focus to a parent and its children like a dropdown menu, but                 |
| [27:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1657.52) | then when you focus to a link within that dropdown menu, it would disappear because                      |
| [27:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1660.92) | you weren't focused on the parent anymore.                                                               |
| [27:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1662.9)  | So Focus Within allows for you to apply styles to that parent to make it stay styled or open             |
| [27:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1667.8)  | or whatever as you are focusing within it into its children and this is just like a                      |
| [27:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1672.36) | really important big change that happened a few years ago in CSS.                                        |
| [27:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1676.6)  | Not even that long, I think like two years.                                                              |
| [27:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1678.68) | So then there's also Checked and I called this one out.                                                  |
| [28:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1681.6)  | This is when you have a checkbox and it says Checked State.                                              |
| [28:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1684.08) | So you have these states and I love this because it provides a way for you to have state management      |
| [28:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1690.92) | in CSS.                                                                                                  |
| [28:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1692.3)  | So I've used Checked to create CSS games like little games with targets that you click and               |
| [28:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1697.68) | then you can use counters to count up your score and you can do so much with Checked.                    |
| [28:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1701.6)  | I've used Checked to build entire presentations out of just HTML and CSS like 45-minute talks            |
| [28:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1708.52) | by using Checked to show more information as like a little toggle to like slowly show                    |
| [28:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1715.36) | what's next and there's a lot of cool CSS properties that we use in that presentation.                   |
| [28:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1719.56) | Some of my favorites, but yeah, I just wanted to bring up Checked because there's a lot                  |
| [28:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1723.34) | of fun things you could do when you hack Checked with the adjacent sibling selector.                     |
| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1727.8)  | With the adjacent sibling selector which is the same like some one of my favorites is                    |
| [28:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1730.84) | target and target within that we talked about that episode.                                              |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1733.52) | Same thing you're managing like you're kind of connecting the URL with some state in your                |
| [28:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1737.24) | application and using it to do fun stuff.                                                                |
| [29:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1740.04) | Super rad.                                                                                               |
| [29:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1741.04) | Yeah, so that's just the start of it, right?                                                             |
| [29:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1742.52) | This is what's so fun I think about Checked and is that those are just the tip of the                    |
| [29:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1746.98) | iceberg of what you can do.                                                                              |
| [29:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1748.66) | The fact that that's on and off people do amazing things with that single Boolean that's                 |
| [29:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1754.4)  | the start of it.                                                                                         |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1755.62) | It's a whole new world.                                                                                  |
| [29:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1757.96) | I just win falsetto on a crap.                                                                           |
| [29:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1759.92) | What were your favorite pseudo selectors?                                                                |
| [29:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1762.12) | Yeah, target and target within.                                                                          |
| [29:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1763.9)  | So target within was new to me that that was even a thing and I was like, yeah, yeah, why                |
| [29:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1768.0)  | not?                                                                                                     |
| [29:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1769.0)  | I mean, because that could be a tab like I use a target within or target all the time                    |
| [29:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1772.1)  | for like a tab on a tab component to show which one is currently open.                                   |
| [29:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1775.8)  | Then you can share a deep link to a page that has the same tab open up to someone else.                  |
| [29:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1781.6)  | But then I could use target within and use that same state to do cool state stuff inside                 |
| [29:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1786.68) | of the element.                                                                                          |
| [29:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1787.68) | So I'm excited about those.                                                                              |
| [29:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1789.42) | We have border next.                                                                                     |
| [29:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1790.68) | You want to move to border or were there more pseudo selectors you want to chat about?                   |
| [29:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1794.24) | Let's talk about borders.                                                                                |
| [29:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1795.32) | We'll move on to borders.                                                                                |
| [29:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1796.48) | Cool.                                                                                                    |
| [29:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1797.48) | I have a couple notes here.                                                                              |
| [29:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1798.48) | One of them is we are under utilizing border image.                                                      |
| [30:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1802.08) | I remember just the more we studied about border image, we're like, whoa, you can, whoa.                 |
| [30:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1806.96) | And then you can, it was just like multi-layered again, it's like tip of an iceberg, all this            |
| [30:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1811.58) | opportunity and we don't use them very much.                                                             |
| [30:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1814.56) | I remember multi-layering gradients is just this effect that you can build art with or                   |
| [30:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1819.12) | you can build really elegant gradients with.                                                             |
| [30:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1821.7)  | And then the slice feature of border image was this really cool way of you like slicing                  |
| [30:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1825.92) | the whole thing into these little quadrants and then saying, yes, but only fill this one.                |
| [30:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1830.84) | And it was just so cool.                                                                                 |
| [30:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1832.4)  | Just so much good thought from the CSS working group and the way that they make these APIs.              |
| [30:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1836.2)  | I'm constantly impressed.                                                                                |
| [30:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1837.2)  | What about you?                                                                                          |

| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1839.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [30:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1840.2)  | I thought that border image source is really fun because you could put any media type in                 |
| [30:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1843.92) | there like a JPEG or a video or a GIF and you could just have a lot of fun with border                   |
| [30:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1849.56) | image sources.                                                                                           |
| [30:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1850.56) | Also, I want to say a shout out to the regular border styles the browser gives us.                       |
| [30:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1855.98) | We don't have just solid but we have groove and ridge and inset, outset, dotted, dash,                   |
| [31:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1860.92) | double and you know, of course, solid which is what we usually use.                                      |
| [31:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1864.68) | I also learned that border radius lets you set two border radius values.                                 |
| [31:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1869.92) | And for some reason, I've never done this before in my UIs but of course, that's an                      |
| [31:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1874.2)  | option.                                                                                                  |
| [31:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1875.2)  | Like instead of border radius 50%, that's a shorthand essentially for saying the border                  |
| [31:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1880.32) | top left radius, border top right radius, border bottom right radius and border bottom                   |
| [31:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1884.7)  | left radius.                                                                                             |
| [31:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1885.7)  | So, you go all around and then each of those border radiuses can get two values.                         |
| [31:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1890.36) | So, you have like the border radius from the left side and the top side for the border                   |
| [31:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1896.16) | top left radius.                                                                                         |
| [31:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1897.2)  | So, it's more complex than I realized.                                                                   |
| [31:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1900.26) | And with that complexity, you can do some cool shapes.                                                   |
| [31:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1902.4)  | I'm waiting for the design tool to give me all that power.                                               |
| [31:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1905.72) | So, which web tool that claims web design will be the first one to let designers manage                  |
| [31:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1910.36) | all of those corners with some sort of GUI?                                                              |
| [31:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1913.08) | Who's going to do it?                                                                                    |
| [31:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1914.08) | I'm excited.                                                                                             |
| [31:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1915.08) | Yeah, why don't we have that now?                                                                        |
| [31:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1916.56) | I don't know.                                                                                            |
| [31:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1917.56) | It makes really cool shapes like, well, what do we see?                                                  |
| [31:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1919.12) | We saw blobs, we saw, well, just more unique boxes, right?                                               |
| [32:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1922.74) | Because they could sort of tweak these.                                                                  |
| [32:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1924.08) | It's like parallelograms that had variously rounded corners.                                             |
| [32:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1927.6)  | Yeah, it's like a rounded corner skewed effect, which is really hard to do otherwise.                    |
| [32:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1932.4)  | So, yeah, super cool stuff.                                                                              |
| [32:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1934.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [32:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1935.2)  | And then we talked about shadows in episode 17 and we covered a wide gamut of different                  |
| [32:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1940.04) | types of shadows.                                                                                        |
| [32:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1941.04) | We had drop shadows, box shadows, text shadows.                                                          |
| [32:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1943.52) | And then we talked about multiple shadows and that was sort of my funnest point of that                  |
| [32:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1947.52) | show, my funnest topic, I think, that we chatted about.                                                  |
| [32:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1950.2)  | But multiple shadows are a lot of fun to work with.                                                      |
| [32:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1952.16) | We chatted about creating like pixel art with shadows because you can have an endless array              |
| [32:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1956.64) | of shadows on any given CSS element.                                                                     |
| [32:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1959.68) | And there are a lot of cool projects that are like one div art and single div art and                    |
| [32:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1964.34) | it's all like just a ton of shadows.                                                                     |
| [32:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1966.8)  | And I'm not saying this is performant, I'm not saying to do this, but it's just really                   |
| [32:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1969.52) | cool how creative people get with CSS.                                                                   |

| [32:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1973.64) | It was.                                                                                                  |
| [32:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1974.64) | It's like another one of those things, right?                                                            |
| [32:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1975.64) | Oh, I can layer multiple shadows.                                                                        |
| [32:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1977.16) | Well, if I make a shadow that's just on a square and then I can make multiple squares                    |
| [33:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1981.72) | and I can just position the squares around and there you go.                                             |
| [33:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1983.96) | It's another one of those things like single concept.                                                    |
| [33:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1986.56) | It's an iceberg of opportunity inside of CSS.                                                            |
| [33:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=1989.12) | So box shadow art was a lot of the pixel art.                                                            |

| [33:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2001.12) | the quality level it's coming out.                                                                       |

| [33:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2010.64) | There's something really unique and interesting about that and I just like the way it looks.             |
| [33:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2014.44) | An article came out recently saying how awesome drop shadow is the filter and I was like,                |
| [33:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2019.76) | yeah, but there's no spread on the drop shadow.                                                          |
| [33:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2022.08) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [33:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2023.08) | And it's just kind of fun being the one that's just like, oh, but this is just such a fun                |
| [33:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2026.68) | web unique shadow property.                                                                              |
| [33:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2028.4)  | Ooh, shadow property is fun to say.                                                                      |
| [33:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2030.6)  | Anyway, yes, I really liked the spread property of that one.                                             |
| [33:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2034.16) | That moves us into the focus episode where we got to talk about another tip of the iceberg,              |
| [33:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2038.36) | things that you can do that are crazy with focus.                                                        |
| [34:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2040.64) | We talked about how focus is a good one to come along for the ride with active and we                    |
| [34:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2044.92) | had some tips inside of there.                                                                           |
| [34:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2046.48) | What do you remember about focus?                                                                        |
| [34:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2048.16) | A really important concept in focus that we talked about was tab index and within tab                    |
| [34:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2052.86) | index we talked about different values of like zero, negative one and one or more.                       |
| [34:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2058.52) | And we talked about how you should probably not use one or more, but with zero you basically             |
| [34:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2063.56) | enable anything that doesn't originally get focused to get focused, like a span element                  |
| [34:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2068.68) | or any element really that's not like a link or a form element.                                          |
| [34:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2072.68) | They usually wouldn't have focus, but if you want them to have focus and give it a tab                   |
| [34:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2075.76) | index of zero.                                                                                           |
| [34:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2076.76) | So if you're creating UIs, this is really useful.                                                        |
| [34:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2079.32) | And a tab index of negative one allows for programmatic focus.                                           |
| [34:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2082.76) | So this sort of takes it out of the DOM focus order, but you can do programmatic focus with              |
| [34:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2087.8)  | JavaScripts.                                                                                             |
| [34:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2088.92) | But if you use a tab index of one or more, then you're going to have the element be tabbed               |
| [34:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2094.28) | to before other elements on that page, which could affect how someone uses the page and                  |
| [35:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2100.08) | could be a little confusing for order.                                                                   |
| [35:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2101.96) | So I think that having an understanding of tab index and what the values mean is important               |
| [35:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2107.24) | for web developers.                                                                                      |
| [35:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2108.24) | You're right.                                                                                            |
| [35:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2109.24) | I think that's the best part of that episode was how do I orchestrate this and what does                 |
| [35:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2112.38) | it mean?                                                                                                 |
| [35:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2113.38) | And I think you covered roving index in there as well as like this like trapping concept                 |
| [35:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2117.48) | where you can trap focus intentionally to keep users in a space where choice needs to                    |
| [35:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2121.6)  | be made and then let them escape or escape naturally.                                                    |
| [35:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2124.68) | Anyway, roving index was a topic in there which can be complex but very valuable for                     |
| [35:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2129.64) | user experience.                                                                                         |
| [35:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2130.64) | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| [35:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2131.64) | Awesome.                                                                                                 |
| [35:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2132.64) | Good call.                                                                                               |
| [35:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2133.64) | And now we are on episode 19, Z-index and stacking context.                                              |
| [35:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2137.56) | And this is another one of those episodes that seemed simple but got pretty in depth.                    |
| [35:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2142.12) | But one thing that I just want to say that I think is one of the biggest takeaways from                  |
| [35:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2146.16) | this episode is if you are having issues with your Z-index, if you're setting it to 9000                 |
| [35:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2150.88) | and still not working, you might be missing a position value.                                            |
| [35:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2155.08) | You need to have a position other than static for any specified Z-index to work.                         |
| [36:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2159.52) | So this is usually like the number one Z-index issue.                                                    |
| [36:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2162.54) | It's a quick fix.                                                                                        |
| [36:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2163.64) | But if you don't know about this, you could have a lot of heartache and frustration in                   |
| [36:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2168.42) | your life.                                                                                               |
| [36:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2169.42) | Yep.                                                                                                     |
| [36:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2170.42) | Definitely a hot tip there.                                                                              |
| [36:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2171.42) | I remember, I don't even think I can accurately represent it, but we had rendering contexts              |
| [36:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2177.32) | versus containing blocks versus stacking contexts in terms of like what position value, so like          |
| [36:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2184.04) | if you're a position absolute, you become a stacking context and a containing block.                     |
| [36:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2188.0)  | Well, no, you were already a containing block.                                                           |
| [36:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2190.36) | You put absolute position on there.                                                                      |
| [36:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2192.0)  | Now you're a stacking context.                                                                           |
| [36:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2194.04) | And if you translate or change your opacity, you're additionally a rendering layer.                      |
| [36:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2199.08) | So like these different types of boxes that you get assigned based on the way that you                   |
| [36:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2204.44) | position yourself and Z-index and stacking context is the first place where people start                 |
| [36:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2209.16) | to really feel that effect where they're like, why am I not trapped, et cetera.                          |
| [36:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2213.8)  | So yeah, good episode.                                                                                   |
| [36:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2215.32) | And maybe I did remember it.                                                                             |
| [36:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2216.92) | I don't know.                                                                                            |
| [36:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2217.92) | Yeah, we talked about how Z-index can create stacking context and what that means and compositing        |
| [37:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2222.56) | layers and other things that create composited layers like will change or transforms or opacity.         |
| [37:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2228.76) | So this is what makes performant animations sort of run in CSS.                                          |
| [37:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2234.24) | And it's because it's creating these composite layers for those animations to run on.                    |
| [37:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2238.2)  | Yep.                                                                                                     |
| [37:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2239.2)  | This makes it a little bit more efficient.                                                               |
| [37:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2240.2)  | What a fun episode.                                                                                      |
| [37:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2241.4)  | Onto functions, which I especially loved, of course, there were lots and lots to choose                  |
| [37:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2247.04) | from.                                                                                                    |
| [37:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2248.04) | What do you remember specifically in the functions one?                                                  |
| [37:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2249.32) | Oh, this is probably one of my favorite episodes because I too love the power of functions               |
| [37:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2254.36) | in CSS.                                                                                                  |
| [37:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2256.04) | Really hard to pick favorites, I will say, but things that I like talking about pseudo                   |
| [37:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2260.8)  | selector functions like not and is are really interesting.                                               |
| [37:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2264.92) | They'll let you put in information there and even comma separated lists of information                   |
| [37:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2269.44) | in there and help you with selection.                                                                    |
| [37:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2271.24) | I think those are super powerful when you are writing CSS.                                               |
| [37:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2275.62) | Also I love talking about the animation functions like cubic bezier and we talked about gradient         |
| [38:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2280.62) | functions, we talked about color functions, we talked about transform functions.                         |
| [38:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2284.04) | And these are important to understand like that smooth 60 frames per second animation.                   |
| [38:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2289.08) | Again like when we talk about composite layers, transforms love for composite.                           |
| [38:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2291.88) | So it is all very intertwined.                                                                           |
| [38:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2295.2)  | But I thought this episode specifically was like just super fun to put together and to                   |
| [38:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2299.2)  | record to do.                                                                                            |
| [38:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2300.2)  | I agree.                                                                                                 |
| [38:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2301.2)  | The list was so long from animations to making variables.                                                |
| [38:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2304.52) | I think the biggest takeaway for me was the realization that anytime CSS was invoking                    |
| [38:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2310.24) | a function it was because there was some runtime contextual like dynamic effect happening.               |
| [38:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2316.12) | And it was this instant thing to know that it was calling a function in my CSS because                   |
| [38:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2320.62) | there was no way it could know this ahead of time.                                                       |
| [38:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2323.48) | It had to go get it now and it had to go get it in the moment when it needed it.                         |
| [38:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2327.92) | And it was just like to see the list of how many of those there were and how they all                    |
| [38:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2332.24) | typically interplay really well is really amazing.                                                       |
| [38:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2335.6)  | There are a couple scenarios where you can't use them together but even that is getting                  |
| [38:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2339.04) | enhanced in the spec and we're seeing enhancements there like the attribute function.                    |
| [39:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2343.28) | The attribute function can get values off of your HTML but it can't always return them                   |
| [39:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2347.2)  | in a format that CSS is ready to understand.                                                             |
| [39:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2349.56) | This is a lot like Houdini trying to teach CSS how to translate a gradient.                              |
| [39:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2355.16) | It just didn't know how to translate a string into a type.                                               |
| [39:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2358.58) | So there's so much cool stuff coming in the functions one.                                               |
| [39:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2361.88) | That was a really amazing episode.                                                                       |
| [39:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2364.24) | Logical properties and functions definitely super high up on the list of favorite episodes               |
| [39:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2368.72) | of season one TCP.                                                                                       |
| [39:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2370.8)  | I also feel like the next episode, episode 21 was one of my favorites.                                   |
| [39:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2375.04) | I had so much fun with a lot of these episodes honestly but like gradient specifically, we               |
| [39:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2379.2)  | love talking about color, we love talking about gradient, we love talking about like                     |
| [39:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2381.28) | art in the web.                                                                                          |
| [39:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2382.28) | And so this felt a lot of fun to put together but I think a highlight of this show was talking           |
| [39:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2386.64) | about Connet gradients and all of their use cases as well.                                               |
| [39:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2390.44) | And we talked about repeating gradients and repeating Connet gradients.                                  |
| [39:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2393.16) | It looks like these really cool sunbursts and we talked about like mixing gradients                      |
| [39:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2398.8)  | too.                                                                                                     |
| [40:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2399.8)  | That's something that I really like doing is making a layer of mixed gradient.                           |
| [40:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2403.52) | So maybe a circle gradient at top and then you can layer that next to a radial gradient                  |
| [40:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2408.84) | from the bottom and then maybe have like a gradient that's linear that's from negative                   |
| [40:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2413.28) | 45 degrees so it comes like off from the bottom right top left and maybe you could position              |
| [40:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2418.84) | it like negative 50% so it'll be off of the center so you like have more space to mix                    |
| [40:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2424.4)  | and match gradients.                                                                                     |
| [40:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2425.4)  | And so we talked about all of the naming conventions for gradients and how you can mix those together    |
| [40:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2430.34) | and then I use that for filter effects and for mixing with blend modes and for backgrounds               |
| [40:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2436.4)  | and so there's some really cool effects you can do with gradients.                                       |
| [40:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2439.76) | What did you like about the gradients episode?                                                           |
| [40:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2441.2)  | What do you remember?                                                                                    |
| [40:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2442.2)  | Oh man, you covered so much of the good stuff already.                                                   |
| [40:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2444.36) | I definitely remember we were studying the gradient syntax and then we both looked at                    |
| [40:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2449.6)  | each other when we were like repeating conic gradients.                                                  |
| [40:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2453.08) | Is that in the spec?                                                                                     |
| [40:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2454.08) | Is that a thing?                                                                                         |
| [40:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2455.08) | And we were like no that sounds way too complex like conic gradients.                                    |
| [40:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2458.32) | And then we saw it and we're like whoa!                                                                  |
| [41:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2460.32) | And then it was boom!                                                                                    |
| [41:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2461.32) | Yeah we were just so amazed.                                                                             |
| [41:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2463.56) | We just like we're totally new CSS nerds all over again.                                                 |
| [41:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2467.28) | I remember falling in love with some of the syntax subtleties that are tucked into these                 |
| [41:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2472.68) | specs that try to make this really nice.                                                                 |
| [41:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2474.28) | So the radial gradient syntax saying I want a circle at bottom right.                                    |
| [41:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2479.6)  | You know and you're just like oh wow so the width of this is just going to be the width                  |
| [41:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2482.44) | of the element and then it'll be starting at the center point of the bottom right.                       |
| [41:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2486.64) | I'll just sort of gradient out from there.                                                               |
| [41:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2488.76) | Like how cool is that syntax?                                                                            |
| [41:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2490.6)  | And then I also remember getting really attached to and being a fan of transition hints.                 |
| [41:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2497.4)  | So whereas like traditional gradients I would say 0% to 100% and I would sort of infer that              |
| [41:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2503.6)  | there was just going from one to the next pretty linearly.                                               |
| [41:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2506.96) | Now I can omit those values and just say like white to black but I can specify the transition            |
| [41:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2512.88) | hint sort of like where does the curve start to really dip.                                              |
| [41:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2515.8)  | And I'm just a huge fan of that.                                                                         |
| [41:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2517.12) | So again it's like these like subtleties in the knowledge of the syntax that help me create              |
| [42:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2521.92) | gradients that are just a little more natural.                                                           |
| [42:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2525.72) | They're just a little bit more organic and yet the syntax is still so terse and so minimal.              |
| [42:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2532.76) | I'm geeking out over gradients right now aren't I?                                                       |
| [42:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2534.96) | Anyway yes I liked those things about gradients.                                                         |
| [42:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2537.48) | It was awesome.                                                                                          |
| [42:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2539.12) | Episode 22 is on animation which is another behemoth of like content and functions and                   |
| [42:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2544.32) | concepts and timelines and what do you remember about the animations episode?                            |
| [42:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2548.7)  | I remember talking about animation timing functions and like the gradient easing curves                  |
| [42:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2553.64) | and how they work and what they mean and talking about step animations like the steps function           |
| [42:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2559.32) | so you can do like a ticking clock animation and these were all really cool things to break              |
| [42:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2563.72) | down and find use cases for.                                                                             |
| [42:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2565.6)  | I agree.                                                                                                 |
| [42:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2566.6)  | I remember thinking about keyframe effects which is like a JavaScript concept but I wanted               |
| [42:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2570.76) | CSS to think about it too and just like that the styles that you're attaching to position                |
| [42:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2576.0)  | 0% or whatever that these are like they're kind of mobile.                                               |
| [43:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2579.76) | Right so I liked talking about keyframe effects and that a keyframe animation was just a collection      |
| [43:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2584.84) | of effects that apply to something over time.                                                            |
| [43:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2587.84) | Really fun to break down the things that we use that are very simple like I feel like                    |
| [43:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2592.16) | the animation syntax is especially simple but once you go break it down and you understand               |
| [43:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2596.8)  | slow pieces you're like no this is as complex as other places animation lives like in JavaScript         |
| [43:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2602.52) | like if I'm doing a gsap animation or something but I get it in this very declarative succinct           |
| [43:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2608.0)  | way and as long as I'm practicing and I'm reading I can figure out how to tap into these                 |
| [43:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2612.52) | really powerful animation techniques with very very little code and yeah I'm always                      |
| [43:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2617.14) | all about that.                                                                                          |
| [43:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2618.24) | Our next episode was episode 23 and that was all about CSS filters.                                      |
| [43:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2623.72) | What do you recall from this episode Adam?                                                               |
| [43:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2626.08) | Filters okay so I remember very specifically you were a pro at this episode.                             |
| [43:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2631.24) | I had to do much more research and listening to you break these things down and you're                   |
| [43:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2635.96) | just like super casual oh yeah it's just when that the backdrop is layered with the front                |
| [43:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2639.28) | thing and you get the opposite of the colors it's like blam blam and I was like I was sitting            |
| [44:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2642.92) | there like oh I'm not as ready for this as she is.                                                       |
| [44:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2646.32) | That might have been blend modes.                                                                        |
| [44:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2648.44) | But I also remember a lot of the concepts being so much smaller than I think about them                  |
| [44:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2652.28) | like I remember being in Photoshop and I just go play with all the filters just be like                  |
| [44:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2655.74) | all the blend modes or whatever just be like oh that's the next one so yeah we're not even               |
| [44:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2659.26) | on blend modes yet but thinking about how these things affect each other and the way                     |
| [44:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2663.46) | that the colors are intermixing and just realizing the whole time how impressive your knowledge          |
| [44:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2668.0)  | was on it.                                                                                               |
| [44:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2669.0)  | So that's one of my biggest memories was I was so impressed with your filter and blend                   |
| [44:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2671.64) | mode knowledge.                                                                                          |
| [44:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2672.64) | Oh that's so nice.                                                                                       |
| [44:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2673.64) | Anyway what do you remember all of it?                                                                   |
| [44:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2676.48) | Yeah I just have like a weird interest in filters and blend modes so I did a lot of                      |
| [44:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2680.36) | like CSS sort of work on that a few years ago I guess earlier in my career but yeah                      |
| [44:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2685.42) | I love this topic I love filters and blend modes there's so much you can create with                     |
| [44:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2689.56) | CSS filters so in the show we went over saturation and brightness and sepia invert all 10 filters        |
| [44:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2694.88) | in CSS and the cool thing about filters is you can use them anywhere so it's not just                    |
| [44:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2699.36) | media and images but you can use them on text inline text you can use them for hover states              |
| [45:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2703.76) | and focus states and just different areas in your UI and backgrounds and things like                     |
| [45:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2707.72) | that.                                                                                                    |
| [45:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2708.84) | Another fun thing to note is that CSS filters are essentially shortcuts for the much more                |
| [45:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2713.16) | powerful SVG filter effects and you can still define your own custom filters in SVG and                  |
| [45:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2719.52) | access those filters by a name ID with an inline SVG on the page using a URL parameter                   |
| [45:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2725.92) | in your CSS so you can use like Effie blend Effie function for different channels like                   |
| [45:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2732.56) | the RGB and a channels you can use an Effie color matrix and define a new type of color                  |
| [45:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2737.58) | filter effect that's specific to your brand and you can do like cool duotone effects and                 |
| [45:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2742.94) | things like that and then use the URL parameter and it's just such a world of endless possibilities      |
| [45:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2748.52) | and the other fun thing about filters that they are interoperable because they are specific              |
| [45:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2753.08) | pixel values that change from one value to another so as you're defining these really                    |
| [45:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2758.88) | interesting transformations for your pixels you can also see them animate so I just think                |
| [46:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2764.52) | that it's a super cool underutilized CSS feature and we kind of nerd out about it in                     |
| [46:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2769.2)  | this episode.                                                                                            |
| [46:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2770.2)  | I agree and I'm glad you brought up the Effie turbulence and some of these other ones because            |
| [46:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2774.06) | I've seen two demos recently they're filter demos but they're not labeled filter demos                   |
| [46:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2778.92) | so the first one is a super cool react demo where these balls are floating towards each                  |
| [46:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2784.08) | other and then they merge and they sort of become a blob and then they de blob and they                  |
| [46:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2787.92) | do this stuff and I'm like that's not a react feature CSS is doing all of the work.                      |
| [46:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2793.16) | That's SVG yeah.                                                                                         |
| [46:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2794.16) | I was like what this isn't a react plugin this is just anyway whatever that was one                      |
| [46:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2799.16) | example I saw another one where somebody was allowing you to take your logo and completely               |
| [46:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2803.16) | distort it in like a very jagged effect like it was a vortex effect that's what it was                   |
| [46:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2808.4)  | it was like a geometric vortex effect and they were like look at this cool thing that                    |
| [46:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2812.72) | JavaScript's doing I'm like again this is all CSS the whole reason that that's even                      |
| [46:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2816.84) | happening is the heavy lifter of this entire thing is CSS and it's getting no credit.                    |
| [47:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2821.96) | No I'm not actually that sad but filters I was just noticing that filters are doing all                  |
| [47:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2827.4)  | the cool feature work here so they're under the hood of many things doing lots of cool                   |
| [47:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2831.44) | stuff yeah I agree.                                                                                      |
| [47:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2832.44) | Which goes into blend modes and again blend modes you just knew everything about them                    |
| [47:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2836.16) | it was amazing.                                                                                          |
| [47:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2837.16) | I wouldn't say that.                                                                                     |
| [47:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2838.24) | But I really liked thinking about my lights and darks over time anyway it's like I got                   |
| [47:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2842.12) | more conscious about my darker and my lighter pixels and the way that I can make those blend             |
| [47:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2847.26) | together based on which pictures on top which ones on bottom and some things like that so                |
| [47:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2851.64) | lots of cool layering concepts for me to think about with pixels on pixels and how they interact.        |
| [47:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2857.0)  | Blending modes what do you remember?                                                                     |
| [47:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2858.0)  | Yeah so we went over all the different types of blend modes and sort of the differences                  |
| [47:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2861.3)  | between what exists in design software and what exists in the browser and a lot of cool                  |
| [47:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2866.12) | things you can do with blend modes like use them for performance benefits like decreasing                |
| [47:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2870.12) | the contrast and adding it back in the browser and we talked about using things like difference          |
| [47:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2874.92) | to spot the difference between pixel values because that's what you would use when you                   |
| [47:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2878.72) | were like lining up photographs and making sure that everything was pixel perfect and                    |
| [48:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2882.92) | it shows like the true difference between two color values.                                              |
| [48:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2885.4)  | We talked about like lighten versus darken and what the algorithms sort of mean when                     |
| [48:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2889.96) | you're creating these blend modes these applications.                                                    |
| [48:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2894.0)  | We talked about a lot of things and I feel like this episode was a really cool deep dive                 |
| [48:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2897.96) | into some of the possibilities of some practical applications of blend modes in CSS like when            |
| [48:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2903.76) | I talked about difference one thing that I built was like this tool that had a visual                    |
| [48:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2908.68) | diff like visual regression testing between two websites so it could be local and prod                   |
| [48:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2913.44) | and it showed you where any pixel was out of line and it just used literally two iframes                 |
| [48:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2918.2)  | that were layered with a difference blend mode.                                                          |
| [48:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2920.68) | There's just like a lot that you can do with these blend modes one thing to notice that                  |
| [48:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2924.88) | they're not interoperable because it's like an on off switch it's how pixels interact                    |
| [48:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2928.2)  | not the transformation of pixels like filters so there's like a big difference but I thought             |
| [48:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2935.0)  | it was really fun to have all of that together in one episode for you to learn about and                 |
| [48:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2939.48) | love blend modes and use them in your UIs they're decently well supported.                               |
| [49:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2942.64) | I just thought of a magical segue I think because that was the last one right so we                      |
| [49:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2946.92) | have to like segue somehow into sadness except we can tease so here's my segue I want to                 |
| [49:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2953.32) | propose blend modes you're right it's sad they can't interpolate can they you know what                  |
| [49:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2958.96) | might be able to do that work though is Houdini.                                                         |
| [49:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2962.52) | Houdini could theoretically receive these two instructions from a state from one to                      |
| [49:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2968.08) | the next and do the work in a worklet and transform those pixels over time from where                    |
| [49:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2974.52) | it should be to where it's going to go like if it's going to become lighter because of                   |
| [49:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2978.32) | a screen overlay then you can screen over the three seconds and slowly go to that lighter                |
| [49:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2983.52) | pixel so anyway I'm going to throw that out there that maybe Houdini is a way that we                    |
| [49:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2987.76) | can get into animating these and that's our next little mini season is a Houdini mini                    |
| [49:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2992.56) | season so.                                                                                               |
| [49:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2993.56) | I appreciate your thoughts there I will say I think that what you're getting at is like                  |
| [49:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=2998.9)  | a layer that would be increasing in opacity that has a blend mode applied you can change                 |
| [50:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3004.12) | the opacity so you could sort of like blend something in that way but when it comes to                   |
| [50:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3009.8)  | the way that the pixels interact I don't know if you could transition that unless you had                |
| [50:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3014.68) | a lot of calculation like a lot of calculation.                                                          |
| [50:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3017.46) | It'd be a lot of calculations yeah your worklet would need to know like initial state which              |
| [50:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3021.04) | it has and so each worklet can have its own state get past a new place and then get past                 |
| [50:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3025.6)  | time and just try to do it it wouldn't be easy I'm not saying it'd be easy but I think                   |
| [50:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3029.72) | since canvas is a pixel drawing scenario and the task is a pixel computational scenario                  |
| [50:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3036.12) | we could theoretically put it into javascript and run it off the main thread I don't know.               |
| [50:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3041.12) | I like where your head's at I think that would work better for filters but yes I like where              |
| [50:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3045.84) | your head's at.                                                                                          |
| [50:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3047.44) | The segue was we are going to mini series into Houdini next and as we prepare for season                 |
| [50:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3053.1)  | two so anything you want to say about this mini series or what's coming next you know.                   |
| [50:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3058.24) | Yeah so we are going to be putting together a series after this so CSS podcast is not                    |
| [51:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3064.72) | going away but we're going to focus on the different Houdini APIs and just talk about                    |
| [51:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3069.92) | the possibilities there and from there we'll start playing season two for probably next                  |
| [51:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3075.28) | year.                                                                                                    |
| [51:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3076.28) | So yeah a lot to come on the CSS podcast if you like this podcast we'd love to hear about                |
| [51:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3082.84) | it it's been such a journey thank you for joining us on our first season of the CSS                      |
| [51:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3087.52) | podcast we've definitely had so much fun putting it together and diving into the CSS spec and            |

| [51:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cKb0tJzj5pgIJtPRq6pws?&t=3112.0)  | I wasn't looking at Adam and then I was like well I guess it relates to everyone but yeah                |
