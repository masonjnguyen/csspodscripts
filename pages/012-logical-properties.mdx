| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=16.8)    | Today, we're covering logical properties and how to harness the power of block and                  |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=21.38)   | inline flow in your own layouts.                                                                    |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=23.74)   | Logical properties matter because the web is universal.                                             |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=26.36)   | That's the beauty of it.                                                                            |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=27.86)   | The web reaches far and wide, crossing geographical boundaries and languages.                       |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=32.48)   | Language itself is so diverse and unique, and we need to be able to adapt to its changing           |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=37.4)    | features.                                                                                           |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=38.4)    | Up until now, we've been using physical properties which are independent of writing                 |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=42.84)   | mode and usually relegated to the language that you're writing in for that specific                 |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=47.12)   | audience.                                                                                           |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=48.12)   | But that's not the only audience that goes to use your website or web app.                          |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=52.44)   | Enter logical properties, which specifically enable a website's layout to be written                |
| [00:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=56.14)   | in a way that enables consistency irrespective of the writing mode and direction.                   |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=61.48)   | You're going to need some vocab for this episode, and those words specifically are block, inline,   |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=66.84)   | and flow.                                                                                           |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=67.84)   | We'll be talking about these a lot, so it's important to get a strong understanding of              |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=71.36)   | block and inline flow for the rest of the show to make sense.                                       |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=74.28)   | So Adam, can you break these down for us?                                                           |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=76.44)   | Yeah, you know it, but I mean, if we're going to talk about flow, I'm going to need you             |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=79.56)   | to drop a beat so that I can rap over it.                                                           |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=83.08)   | Just kidding.                                                                                       |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=84.08)   | I was about to go for it.                                                                           |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=86.92)   | We'll see where it goes.                                                                            |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=88.36)   | It'd be too hard over GBC.                                                                          |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=89.64)   | Anyway, no, I'm just messing with you.                                                              |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=91.48)   | Block, inline, and flow.                                                                            |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=92.48)   | These are cool words and for context into the steta stage, like let's start a mental                |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=97.2)    | visual because this stuff is just a little abstract without it.                                     |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=100.56)  | So I want you all to imagine three paragraphs of text on a webpage.                                 |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=105.2)   | And for now, let's imagine it's a Latin English document.                                           |
| [01:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=107.8)   | So it means text is going to flow from left to right and paragraphs and blocks are going            |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=112.4)   | to flow from top to bottom, AKA the characters flow from left to right as if you're handwriting     |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=117.5)   | and the paragraphs flow from top to bottom.                                                         |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=120.46)  | Notice how I said flow all funny because the paragraphs are going to flow and the characters        |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=124.38)  | flow.                                                                                               |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=125.38)  | Well, anyway, that's kind of what we're talking about is like directionality of the language        |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=129.0)   | that you're in.                                                                                     |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=130.0)   | So term number one, okay, block flow in our Latin document that we're talking about here            |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=134.78)  | is top to bottom.                                                                                   |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=136.04)  | So our block flow is top to bottom and it's about document content direction.                       |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=141.54)  | Like where does the next paragraph flow to think content blocks in Latin?                           |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=146.76)  | It goes under the previous one, top to bottom, paragraph one, paragraph two, and this is            |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=151.1)   | how blocks flow for Latin top to bottom.                                                            |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=153.54)  | Then we have inline flow and in Latin, this is left to right and it's like your handwriting         |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=158.52)  | direction.                                                                                          |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=159.52)  | Like where does the next character flow to and in Latin new characters go to the right              |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=164.48)  | of the previous one and it's like ABC left to right one after another.                              |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=168.92)  | And this is how the inlines flow for Latin.                                                         |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=171.96)  | So when we're talking about flow relative, right, we had block and inline and flow.                 |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=176.92)  | Logical properties are flow relative and this is their main value add.                              |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=180.76)  | And so what is flow relative?                                                                       |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=182.66)  | It's CSS properties that are contextually tied to language document flows.                          |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=187.28)  | So instead of margin top, which is a physical description, logical properties bring us margin       |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=192.28)  | block start a relative description, a new way to format content that will work for any              |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=197.28)  | language.                                                                                           |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=198.28)  | So if we know margin top made no sense to the Japanese content flow, but margin block               |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=202.4)   | start does, then our intent while working in Latin matches the intent from the visitors             |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=208.56)  | reading in Japanese.                                                                                |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=209.88)  | Okay, so with that document of paragraphs and context in your head, let's dig deeper                |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=214.76)  | into each of the different languages that logical properties help you with.                         |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=218.68)  | You know what you got.                                                                              |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=219.68)  | Right.                                                                                              |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=220.68)  | So I like to think of this specifically as three different examples and that would be               |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=224.56)  | a Latin language like English that's left to right, a language that is right to left                |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=229.48)  | like Arabic, and then some Japanese typefaces.                                                      |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=233.16)  | Those flow vertically.                                                                              |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=235.0)   | So let's just think about something that we're all relatively familiar with something like          |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=240.16)  | Twitter.com, right?                                                                                 |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=241.84)  | So as English is left to right language, you read it left to right, top to bottom.                  |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=246.68)  | You have inline flow being left to right and the block flow is top to bottom.                       |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=250.9)   | When you're reading your tweets, the tweets read inline left to right and the stack of              |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=255.4)   | tweets one after the other goes from top to bottom.                                                 |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=258.9)   | Other layout features like the sidebar navigation are laid out horizontally as compared to the      |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=262.6)   | tweets and trending topics.                                                                         |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=264.36)  | There's other areas in the page, but they all have their own inline and block axes within           |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=269.04)  | these sections going the same direction as each other.                                              |
| [04:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=271.96)  | If we switch this contextual mindset of Twitter.com to a right to left language like Arabic, Arabic |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=279.84)  | is right to left, top to bottom.                                                                    |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=281.74)  | So the inline flow is right to left now.                                                            |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=284.52)  | The block flow would be top to bottom again, so that would be the same.                             |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=288.34)  | So now your tweets read inline right to left and stack top to bottom.                               |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=292.7)   | So now wouldn't it make sense to also move the user icon to the start of the tweet?                 |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=297.9)   | The start of the tweet is no longer the left side.                                                  |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=300.36)  | It's the right side now.                                                                            |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=301.88)  | And maybe you have some padding from the start of the tweet to push it away from the icon.          |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=306.36)  | We'd want that move, that adjustment for the language direction to also follow this.                |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=311.64)  | We'd want that padding to now be on the right.                                                      |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=313.8)   | So if you use margin left to create that margin or padding left, that would no longer translate     |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=319.88)  | to this right to left writing mode.                                                                 |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=322.72)  | If you use logical properties, you would be able to make that adjustment.                           |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=327.0)   | Otherwise you'd have this weird gap.                                                                |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=328.96)  | Now as I mentioned earlier, there are some Japanese typefaces that flow from top to bottom.         |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=333.78)  | The block flow here is right to left.                                                               |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=336.52)  | So the inline flow, the text that you're reading is top to bottom, and then the blocks would        |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=340.8)   | go right to left because the top to bottom is how you're reading down.                              |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=344.2)   | And then the next sentence paragraph would be on the right from that first one.                     |
| [05:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=349.44)  | So the tweets here might make more contextual sense with the icon at the top of the tweet.          |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=354.22)  | And the spacing between that icon and the text below it should be at the top now, not               |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=358.6)   | the left, not the right, but the top.                                                               |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=360.68)  | So here's another example of how logical properties solve this dilemma.                             |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=364.4)   | You write once using a logical property keyword instead of a directional keyword like top,          |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=370.52)  | right, left, bottom, and you get all that syntax magic enabling the browser to identify             |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=375.96)  | where your spacing and styling should go according to the context of the language's directionality  |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=381.44)  | and reading mode.                                                                                   |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=382.44)  | Yep, you nailed it.                                                                                 |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=383.72)  | And logical properties, they're like your flow relative styling system, right?                      |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=388.28)  | So instead of thinking about things physically, you start to think about things in their flow       |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=392.16)  | direction.                                                                                          |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=393.2)   | And I want to know where's the design tool that's going to first empower logical properties.        |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=397.56)  | I want to be in a design tool and not have to even think about left or top.                         |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=401.36)  | I want it to translate for me.                                                                      |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=403.12)  | Wouldn't that be lovely, lovely, lovely.                                                            |
| [06:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=406.92)  | Okay now I'm singing falsetto.                                                                      |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=407.92)  | Build it.                                                                                           |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=408.92)  | Yeah, here, I'll do it.                                                                             |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=409.92)  | Yeah, build it in this mode.                                                                        |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=411.28)  | Okay, so without going into too much detail on each of the logical properties, values,              |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=416.0)   | and features that it has, we do want to give you though a quick macro view into what the            |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=419.68)  | syntax is changing to so you can kind of start getting your initial tastes into the features        |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=425.2)   | and the verbiage that's going on here.                                                              |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=427.2)   | And I'm going to start with the keywords.                                                           |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=429.12)  | So these are values that you can pass to logical properties.                                        |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=432.16)  | And one of them is inline start and inline end.                                                     |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=435.24)  | And if you think about inline as being like the direction that the characters flow, this            |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=439.44)  | would be like in English or Latin left to right.                                                    |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=442.5)   | And so that your inline start would be where you put the first character and inline end             |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=446.28)  | would be where the last character is.                                                               |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=448.16)  | So again, in Latin, this is like width and it's like a line left or a line right, inline            |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=453.0)   | start and inline end.                                                                               |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=454.64)  | There's also block start and block end.                                                             |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=457.24)  | So if inline start and inline end is left and right, block start and block end in a                 |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=461.76)  | Latin language would be like top and bottom.                                                        |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=464.88)  | Also in a right to left language like Arabic, that would still be top and bottom.                   |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=468.96)  | But if you change to a vertical writing mode, then that would become your right and left            |
| [07:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=475.16)  | instead of the top and bottom because this is where your content flows.                             |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=478.54)  | The block start and the block end of that content flow.                                             |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=481.48)  | Yep.                                                                                                |
| [08:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=482.48)  | I think start and end and block and inline, once these sort of click as being similar               |
| [08:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=487.22)  | to how you're currently using left and right, I think it gets so much easier.                       |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=490.02)  | Like block, I just sort of generally think of as height and inline as width.                        |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=493.38)  | It's just a keyword switch.                                                                         |
| [08:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=494.48)  | It's just a keyword switch.                                                                         |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=495.48)  | And really, it's been a lot easier than I thought.                                                  |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=497.24)  | Okay, so then we also have for floats, floats can accept inline start and inline end, which         |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=501.5)   | is kind of cool.                                                                                    |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=502.5)   | In a previous episode, we talked about floats as sort of magnetizing to one end or the other.       |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=508.16)  | And here you could specify how you want them to magnetize.                                          |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=511.32)  | And we also talked about flexbox in a previous episode.                                             |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=514.52)  | And alignment in flexbox could be flex start or flex end.                                           |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=517.76)  | Akin to that, you can have text alignment.                                                          |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=519.24)  | So you could have text align start and end instead of left and right.                               |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=522.8)   | I like that one too.                                                                                |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=523.84)  | It's so subtle, yet really, really meaningful.                                                      |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=527.04)  | We also have resize.                                                                                |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=528.24)  | So if you don't know what the resize property is on an element, it'll put little handles            |
| [08:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=531.34)  | in the bottom right, at least if you're in a Latin language, and it'll allow users to               |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=534.92)  | change the width and height of like, let's say the text area input that has the resize              |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=538.92)  | property set.                                                                                       |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=540.48)  | And you can pass logical property values to this now, which makes sense, right?                     |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=544.24)  | Because in that text area input, this is accepting user generated written content.                  |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=549.26)  | So we want to be following their language preferences.                                              |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=552.12)  | And if we resize block, we're resizing essentially the top and the bottom.                          |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=556.56)  | So they can resize the height of their content.                                                     |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=558.56)  | And if they resize, and we say inline, they can change the width.                                   |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=561.96)  | Very cool.                                                                                          |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=562.96)  | That's pretty interesting.                                                                          |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=564.06)  | So what does the browser support on the resize?                                                     |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=566.44)  | Ancient, it's in like CSS version two.                                                              |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=569.04)  | That's cool.                                                                                        |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=570.04)  | I don't think I've actually used this ever.                                                         |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=571.12)  | Really?                                                                                             |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=572.12)  | Yeah, it's super random.                                                                            |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=573.12)  | Visbug has prototyped with it as a way for you to get handles on your elements.                     |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=577.16)  | So you click on an element in the DOM, and it would show resize handles and you literally           |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=580.78)  | grab my handles and I'll just pass it to this resize feature.                                       |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=583.84)  | Oh, yeah, I totally have used this.                                                                 |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=585.82)  | Now that I think about it, yeah, so you just set it and then you have like the ability              |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=589.2)   | to resize your code block, for example.                                                             |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=592.04)  | That's what I used it for.                                                                          |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=593.04)  | Yep, yep, exactly.                                                                                  |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=594.22)  | So there's also a couple of interesting units that come with logical properties.                    |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=598.48)  | You might be familiar with VW and VH.                                                               |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=601.6)   | There is the VI and VB units.                                                                       |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=604.64)  | They're still experimental.                                                                         |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=605.96)  | There's no support yet.                                                                             |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=607.12)  | But VI would be the 1% of the viewport size in the root elements inline axis.                       |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=613.92)  | So it's like viewport inline and then VB is the viewport block.                                     |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=618.58)  | So that would be 1% of the viewport sizes root element block axis.                                  |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=624.56)  | So those could be cool to experiment with in the future.                                            |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=627.26)  | I think that that could help with sort of like first glance screens.                                |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=632.08)  | I know that people like to use the size of their viewport to adjust like spacing from               |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=637.6)   | the bottom, things like that.                                                                       |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=638.92)  | But now you can adjust it based on the directionality of your content.                              |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=642.32)  | Yep.                                                                                                |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=643.32)  | So that's it for like values that you can pass to logical properties.                               |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=646.92)  | But what about all the different aspects of my blocks that I'm making?                              |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=651.26)  | So I have a div and, you know, usually use margin left or width and height.                         |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=655.48)  | But these are all brand new properties and we're going to list them out for you really              |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=658.84)  | quick so you can get a high level kind of, you know, look into what's changed.                      |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=663.04)  | So for example, we have logical property, block size and inline size.                               |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=668.38)  | These are very similar to height and width, but their language agnostic.                            |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=673.64)  | So it's even better.                                                                                |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=674.64)  | And so if we have block size, that means we also have max block size and min block size.            |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=679.38)  | So it's like max height, min height.                                                                |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=681.38)  | And then we also have max inline size and min inline size.                                          |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=684.22)  | So we have the same thing for width and height, but we have them for the block and inline           |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=687.72)  | in logical property land.                                                                           |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=689.2)   | Which is really cool because if you are using like max and min sizes, which you probably            |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=692.98)  | are like setting width and height, you can just change a keyword and have that be relevant          |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=698.36)  | relative to your content layout based on the writing and reading mode.                              |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=701.56)  | It's pretty cool.                                                                                   |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=702.56)  | Yeah, I think I use min block size in almost every one of my demos on the body tag.                 |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=707.24)  | So I say min block size is 100%, which is like the same thing as min height 100%.                   |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=711.84)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=712.84)  | So similar to that, you can adjust margin instead of doing like margin left, margin                 |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=717.0)   | right, you can use margin block and margin inline.                                                  |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=720.34)  | So you could do like margin block start and margin inline end.                                      |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=724.5)   | The margin block start would be like the Latin margin top.                                          |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=729.36)  | The margin block end would be like margin bottom.                                                   |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=732.42)  | And then with the inline, the margin inline start would be like margin left and then margin         |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=736.32)  | inline end would be like margin right.                                                              |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=738.84)  | Keyword changes.                                                                                    |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=739.84)  | Yep.                                                                                                |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=740.84)  | And exactly we have this keyword changes.                                                           |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=742.48)  | At least they're consistent, right?                                                                 |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=743.72)  | It's always block start and block end and inline start and inline end.                              |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=746.5)   | You could just like command F, search and replace.                                                  |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=749.28)  | I mean, yeah, you could.                                                                            |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=751.22)  | But check that.                                                                                     |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=752.68)  | Well, and then there's like cool new powers too.                                                    |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=755.32)  | So you just went over margin.                                                                       |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=756.48)  | So the same thing applies for padding, right?                                                       |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=758.12)  | We have padding block, which is the top and bottom padding inline, which is left and right.         |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=761.4)   | We have padding block start, which is the same thing as padding top.                                |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=764.16)  | But I want to call out that if you use padding block or padding inline, have you ever wanted        |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=769.0)   | a margin shorthand that's just left and right?                                                      |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=771.48)  | Like, have you ever wanted to just say margin left and right are 10 pixels or something             |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=776.16)  | like that?                                                                                          |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=777.16)  | You can now do that.                                                                                |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=778.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=779.16)  | And I usually use the shorthand that's with all four or two of them.                                |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=781.6)   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=782.6)   | There's zeros in there, right?                                                                      |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=783.6)   | And there might be people that are like, well, you shouldn't pass defaults into something           |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=787.72)  | that you don't mean to unset.                                                                       |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=788.72)  | So maybe you didn't want to unset zero.                                                             |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=790.92)  | So then you have to expand your shorthand to be margin left and margin right so that                |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=794.34)  | you're not clobbering any margin top or margin bottom values.                                       |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=797.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=798.64)  | But with the logical property syntax, you can now do left and right or top and bottom               |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=802.56)  | with one shorthand and that's margin block.                                                         |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=805.72)  | So if you write margin block, you can do margin top and bottom in one shorthand, or you can         |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=810.72)  | do margin inline or padding inline and do the padding inline.                                       |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=814.08)  | I use these all the time.                                                                           |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=815.48)  | They're super cool.                                                                                 |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=816.48)  | I'm also a shorthand junkie, but yeah, I find them really convenient.                               |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=819.56)  | So yeah, just wanted to throw that note in there.                                                   |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=821.26)  | Super convenient to have.                                                                           |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=822.26)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=823.26)  | There's also the inset shorthand.                                                                   |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=824.68)  | So you could write inset for where your content exists within a parent.                             |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=829.72)  | So you could do inset as top left, bottom right.                                                    |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=832.48)  | Instead of doing that, you could do inset block and inset inline.                                   |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=836.4)   | You could also write that in a shorthand.                                                           |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=838.6)   | So it's nice to kind of like have the ability to, within a space, identify where you're             |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=844.68)  | placing something and then as that space shifts with the content, have it keep the same inset       |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=850.2)   | dimensions.                                                                                         |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=851.2)   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=852.2)   | It's a super cool one.                                                                              |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=853.2)   | It's a great little shorthand.                                                                      |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=854.24)  | There's also, I think these ones are some of the most meaningful.                                   |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=856.64)  | Honestly, I think logical properties are super meaningful in general, but overflow inline           |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=860.6)   | and overflow block, I think these are especially important as the scrolling directions, like        |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=865.0)   | the things that we're saying we want to scroll, just has so much to do with content                 |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=868.28)  | flow and the direction that these should be moving.                                                 |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=870.52)  | So we have overflow inline and overflow block as sort of replacements for the physical versions     |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=875.08)  | that we talked about, which was like overflow X or overflow Y.                                      |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=878.28)  | I also want to make note too here that all of the scroll padding and scroll margin properties       |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=882.68)  | that exist on overflowed elements and scroll snap points, those also have logical properties        |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=887.58)  | that can be accessed as well.                                                                       |
| [14:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=888.98)  | So you have like margin, scroll padding inline and things like that.                                |
| [14:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=892.42)  | So anyway, all of this block and inline verbiage also works for scroll padding and scroll margin.   |
| [14:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=897.08)  | Kind of cool.                                                                                       |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=898.08)  | And this is especially where it becomes important because as directionality changes, the way        |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=901.6)   | that your user interacts with the page should not get messed up because you were thinking           |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=905.76)  | in one specific language set and direction.                                                         |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=909.42)  | So another less serious one, but also one that we see all over the web is border radius.            |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=915.1)   | And I tend to use the shorthand for this, but you could theoretically do border top                 |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=920.84)  | left radius, border bottom right radius.                                                            |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=923.94)  | And instead of doing that, you could just do border start, start radius, border start               |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=928.88)  | end radius, border end start radius.                                                                |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=932.24)  | So this is kind of funny because the way that it is denoted is inline and block.                    |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=937.08)  | So the top left would be start, start, and then the top right would be start end if we're           |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=943.52)  | relating it to a Latin language.                                                                    |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=944.88)  | So that's border start, start radius, border start end radius.                                      |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=947.76)  | And if we're going around the circle of CSS, but start, start, start end, and then end,             |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=953.04)  | end, end start, that would be top left, bottom right, but in a circle.                              |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=958.12)  | Envision this in your head.                                                                         |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=959.12)  | I'm drawing things with my hands in the air.                                                        |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=962.44)  | Well, I'll be honest, you just made that click for me better.                                       |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=965.6)   | So you might feel like you didn't do that justice, but I come away with that with new               |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=970.32)  | learning.                                                                                           |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=971.32)  | So you're right.                                                                                    |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=972.32)  | It does go start, start.                                                                            |
| [16:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=973.76)  | Like those are mentioning inline and block in the same statement.                                   |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=976.96)  | Very cool.                                                                                          |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=977.96)  | I hadn't noticed that.                                                                              |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=978.96)  | So right on.                                                                                        |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=979.96)  | Same logic applies to border.                                                                       |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=980.96)  | So next was, so you just did border radius.                                                         |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=982.56)  | Same things apply for border.                                                                       |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=983.88)  | We border block and border inline.                                                                  |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=985.66)  | We have border block color, but all of these have logical property versions as well.                |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=989.76)  | I do like another note here for shorthand is again, if like you ever put a border on                |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=993.32)  | the top and the bottom, but not the left and the right, it can get really annoying to like          |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=996.92)  | expand your CSS just so that you target top and bottom.                                             |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1000.4)  | Well now you can do just like you could with margin and padding.                                    |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1002.92) | You have a logical property shorthand.                                                              |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1004.32) | So you can do border block and put a border on just the top and bottom of some content              |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1008.38) | and a nice little single shorthand.                                                                 |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1010.16) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1011.16) | Styling.                                                                                            |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1012.16) | So one thing that's pretty cool that Adam recently made me aware of is that the shorthand           |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1017.2)  | for this, which we mentioned a lot throughout is in discussion with the CSS Working Group.          |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1023.98) | So I was saying that I tend to use shorthands for things like border radius, for example.           |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1029.6)  | Well soon, potentially authors will be able to specify the logical keyword at the beginning         |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1035.88) | of the property.                                                                                    |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1037.36) | So for margin, you could theoretically say margin logical, that's the keyword, and then             |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1043.02) | say like one rem, two rem, three rem, four rem.                                                     |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1046.92) | And this way you're specifying that you want it to use logical properties.                          |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1051.66) | And by doing this, it would just really simplify a lot of this work and a lot of the magic          |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1056.46) | of logical properties.                                                                              |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1057.76) | This isn't supported yet, but having that logical keyword would indicate that you want              |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1062.22) | to use the logical relative flow instead of that initial setup that is sort of top right,           |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1069.36) | bottom left as you're coding.                                                                       |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1071.66) | And I don't understand who wouldn't want to do this because you would get all of those              |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1074.22) | things for free and it's just easy to write, adding a keyword.                                      |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1078.28) | So I think that's pretty cool.                                                                      |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1080.04) | There's like a GitHub issue that Adam pointed me to.                                                |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1082.52) | We'll have that in our show notes if you want to find it.                                           |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1085.2)  | Yeah, I like that issue too because, you know, essentially what we're saying is I want to           |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1088.72) | write margin and then get logical properties for that shorthand instead of the physical             |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1092.9)  | properties that we've been getting.                                                                 |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1094.3)  | But there's, you know, all these documents written in the past, if they're using the                |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1097.54) | margin shorthand, we're not going to just automatically upgrade them to logical properties.         |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1101.16) | They might not want that.                                                                           |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1102.86) | And so it's like, how as an author do I indicate that I want my shorthand, you know, of just        |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1107.46) | margin or padding to be using logical properties?                                                   |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1110.46) | And they have, sometimes they want to put it on the root.                                           |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1113.18) | So you just specify on the root, like my flow is logical.                                           |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1115.94) | So if you see anything that's like logical flow in your root or in an app property, you             |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1119.86) | know, like do I specify it for my whole page?                                                       |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1122.42) | Do I opt in per time I specify?                                                                     |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1124.62) | Anyway, so that's the discussion.                                                                   |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1126.46) | And I think all thoughts are open and we're still trying to figure it out.                          |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1129.62) | So go join in if you have opinions there.                                                           |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1131.82) | And I think that that also is going to be a pretty big game changer with these logical              |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1135.26) | properties because having that as an option, whenever you're reading the code, A, it's              |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1140.58) | going to be more legible and B, you as an author have more control, more specifically               |
| [19:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1145.58) | over when you want something to have logical flow relative versus when you want it to specifically  |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1152.1)  | be top right, bottom left.                                                                          |
| [19:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1154.02) | So I'm definitely interested in seeing where this goes.                                             |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1M8LFVdO5iH3CpXAsTZOKx?&t=1156.66) | I hope that you are too, as a listener of the CSS podcast, but definitely like add your             |
