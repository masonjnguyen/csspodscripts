| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.            |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=17.44)   | Today we're talking about shadows, box shadows, drop shadows, text shadows, and everything         |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=22.5)    | in between.                                                                                        |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=23.5)    | Shadows can exist all over our UI without us even realizing it because sometimes they              |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=27.54)   | just look like borders.                                                                            |
| [00:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=29.04)   | You can use shadows for borders as a great way to create visual space without taking               |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=32.54)   | up geometric space on the page.                                                                    |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=35.26)   | And what does that even mean, Adam?                                                                |
| [00:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=37.24)   | Yeah, what is geometric space on a page?                                                           |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=40.04)   | Like I thought I was building websites, not doing math.                                            |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=42.76)   | Right?                                                                                             |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=43.76)   | Well, it's calling back to our previous box model episodes, right?                                 |
| [00:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=46.76)   | That's what you meant.                                                                             |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=47.76)   | It's like a box takes up space.                                                                    |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=49.36)   | Episode one.                                                                                       |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=50.36)   | It's got to put boxes next to other boxes and that's my job.                                       |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=52.84)   | I put boxes on the screen.                                                                         |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=54.8)    | This box though, I want to paint a shadow on it.                                                   |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=57.52)   | I want it to look like it's floating or I want it to look like it's behind my paper                |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=61.16)   | and into my screen.                                                                                |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=63.24)   | And that's what shadows can do.                                                                    |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=64.3)    | And shadows are relevant to geometric space because they don't take up any.                        |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=67.94)   | And so they're just painted.                                                                       |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=69.32)   | They don't consume or push other things around.                                                    |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=71.84)   | And that can make them really, really handy, especially since these take multiples.                |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=75.76)   | So you can have multiple shadows stacked on top of each other.                                     |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=79.04)   | There's a lot of cool things that you can do with this.                                            |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=81.42)   | And it is just to know if we're looking at the photo frame wall, so go back to that box            |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=84.8)    | model metaphor.                                                                                    |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=86.08)   | The shadows that are being cast on the photo frames, those don't take up any geometric             |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=90.04)   | space and neither do the ones in CSS.                                                              |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=92.64)   | It's painted only.                                                                                 |
| [01:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=93.96)   | And yeah, let's dig into what the box shadow can do, what it's made of, and it's got a             |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=98.28)   | bunch of uses.                                                                                     |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=99.28)   | This episode hopefully will be short, but I don't know.                                            |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=101.96)  | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=102.96)  | So the box shadow property.                                                                        |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=104.8)   | When you're writing box shadow, you specify a horizontal offset, a vertical offset, a blur         |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=110.6)   | radius, a spread distance, a color, and then you specify if you want the box shadow to             |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=116.36)  | be inset.                                                                                          |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=117.36)  | It is outset by default.                                                                           |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=118.6)   | Is it in-y or an out-y?                                                                            |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=121.44)  | So position is the first thing you specify here.                                                   |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=125.12)  | You start by giving it an X and Y offset.                                                          |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=129.1)   | So the X is the horizontal offset from the parent element, from the element that you're            |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=133.0)   | drawing it on.                                                                                     |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=134.12)  | And the Y is the vertical offset.                                                                  |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=135.84)  | So it's like a horizontal to the right and vertical down when you have positive values.            |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=141.44)  | So you can think of this like starting from the zero-zero point in a graph when you're             |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=146.68)  | back in grade school and doing mathematics.                                                        |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=149.56)  | So with positive values, you're moving the shadow to the right and downward.                       |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=153.84)  | The X and Y are positive that way.                                                                 |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=157.08)  | Actually it's the opposite of grade school when it comes to the Y value by default.                |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=161.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=162.72)  | The Y value would by default be upwards in a standard X-Y plot, but with the box shadow,           |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=168.92)  | the Y value being positive goes downward.                                                          |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=172.16)  | And negative values move the Y value upward above the element and to the left of the element       |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=178.64)  | they are applying it to.                                                                           |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=179.92)  | So that's an important thing to note there for a difference with real-world stuff.                 |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=185.4)   | You also can set this to inset.                                                                    |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=188.8)   | So box shadow is outside by default, but you can also specify it to go into the element            |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=194.74)  | and not outside of it.                                                                             |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=196.4)   | And this is different from the border inset outside, which is a border style that imitates         |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=201.32)  | a bevel and uses two colors.                                                                       |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=203.28)  | For box shadow, the inset is a position.                                                           |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=206.32)  | So I've actually used an inset box shadow before with a circular sort of image.                    |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=211.12)  | I had this image with maybe a three pixel shadow around it to create a visual border.              |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=216.48)  | And then I had an interaction with a mouse hover where when you hovered over it, that              |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=222.12)  | box shadow came in all the way to create the solid color over the circle, but it animated          |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=227.48)  | in.                                                                                                |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=228.48)  | And then I had some text appear.                                                                   |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=230.12)  | And so that's just like one way to use the inset shadow instead of outset as, I don't              |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=235.12)  | know.                                                                                              |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=236.12)  | It was just an example.                                                                            |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=237.24)  | And I actually saw this great tip from Hakeem El-Hatab on Twitter, and he recommends using         |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=244.26)  | inset box shadows to add contrast between images and the surrounding page because it's             |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=250.4)   | more seamless than using a border and more flexible.                                               |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=253.0)   | It doesn't take up space.                                                                          |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=254.4)   | And you also have that appear when you have sort of a white image against a white page             |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=259.52)  | and it isn't making like a lot of weird space when you have a darker image on a white page         |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=265.44)  | too.                                                                                               |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=266.44)  | So it's kind of like a seamless inset vibe right there.                                            |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=268.96)  | Yeah, that was a hot tip.                                                                          |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=270.12)  | That's like if you put a white picture on a white wall and you don't know where the                |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=273.08)  | edges are.                                                                                         |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=274.08)  | You're like, oh, I'll throw a border on it.                                                        |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=275.56)  | So you throw a border on it.                                                                       |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=276.88)  | Let's say it's gray and it looks great on the white image.                                         |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=279.64)  | You're like, ah, my white image with the gray border.                                              |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=281.98)  | It's so identifiable now.                                                                          |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=283.68)  | I know it's space, but then you put a different image in there.                                    |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=286.36)  | It has a dark background and you're like, ooh, my dark border is clashing right now.               |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=291.0)   | So how do I make something that can dynamically paint a border and keep a nice clean image         |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=296.0)   | around all my images here?                                                                         |
| [04:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=297.54)  | And so what that tip is, and I agree, it's a hot tip is don't use border.                          |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=301.6)   | Use box shadow, make it really thin and opaque and you're done.                                    |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=305.48)  | Then it's not taking up geometric space in your box, right?                                        |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=307.8)   | It's not a border.                                                                                 |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=309.2)   | It's just a painted outline.                                                                       |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=311.12)  | It's like this hairline thing.                                                                     |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=312.64)  | And if that's a dark image, you won't even see it.                                                 |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=314.96)  | And if it's a light image, you will.                                                               |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=316.9)   | It's like this really dynamic, succinct solution.                                                  |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=318.92)  | Yeah, that's a hot tip.                                                                            |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=320.56)  | Good one.                                                                                          |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=321.56)  | Next is spread.                                                                                    |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=322.68)  | So box shadow spread.                                                                              |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=323.84)  | I have a really weird amount of love for this feature.                                             |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=327.48)  | Maybe it's not weird, but it's just, I love it because it's unique.                                |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=330.52)  | The web is the only one that I know of that has spread and that specifically allows negative       |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=336.4)   | spread.                                                                                            |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=337.4)   | So like I'll open up a design tool and I'll like, Ooh, drop shadow.                                |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=340.72)  | And it's got like X, Y and blur.                                                                   |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=342.28)  | And I'm like, Oh man, the webs is so cool.                                                         |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=345.12)  | I can do this other stuff with it.                                                                 |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=346.64)  | So the spread feature of box shadow, it allows you to expand or contract the shadow in all         |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=351.56)  | directions.                                                                                        |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=352.56)  | You know, like it says, spread it out, but it's super cool because it accepts negative             |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=355.68)  | values like I said, so it can spread inward.                                                       |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=358.12)  | And this results in a shadow that makes the element look lifted up from the page.                  |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=361.62)  | Like the distance from the surface should make the shadow smaller, right?                          |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=364.16)  | I want you to take something on your desk right now that's casting a shadow.                       |
| [06:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=366.92)  | I want you to lift it up slowly and I want you to look at that shadow and see if it's              |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=370.66)  | growing or shrinking as it gets farther from the desk.                                             |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=373.36)  | Anyway, with the spread being negative, you can specify this and you can pull the shadow           |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=377.88)  | in.                                                                                                |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=378.88)  | I think it gives it a more realistic shadow.                                                       |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=381.28)  | So in a design tool, I have to go recreate that by hand.                                           |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=384.3)   | It's such a pain.                                                                                  |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=385.3)   | You have to make a circle or make a square, shrink its scale down, change its background,          |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=389.48)  | blur it and give it opacity.                                                                       |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=390.48)  | You have to recreate the whole shadow just to simulate what it's like to be lifted off             |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=394.44)  | the page.                                                                                          |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=395.44)  | The webs box shadow.                                                                               |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=396.44)  | I love it.                                                                                         |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=397.44)  | Spread.                                                                                            |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=398.44)  | So cool.                                                                                           |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=399.44)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=400.44)  | And the reason why that is so important to have as a property is because by default,               |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=402.84)  | box shadows take the size of their parent element.                                                 |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=405.28)  | And if you want that shadow to be larger or smaller than the parent element, you have              |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=408.24)  | to add some spread to it or remove the spread.                                                     |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=411.28)  | But yeah, as Adam was saying, the negative spread is really, really cool and unique to             |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=415.52)  | see.                                                                                               |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=416.52)  | And we use it all the time when we're creating shadows for a subtle little bounce effect           |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=420.24)  | or space effect on your page, giving items some context.                                           |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=424.08)  | I think box shadows are great.                                                                     |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=425.8)   | Some depth.                                                                                        |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=426.8)   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=427.8)   | So after you spread the shadow out, you can then apply a blur radius.                              |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=431.12)  | And this is a unit value that sets how far out to blur your shadows.                               |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=435.64)  | So you can think of blur as fading the color out to transparent using a Gaussian blur or           |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=440.6)   | Gaussian.                                                                                          |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=441.6)   | I'm not sure how to pronounce that.                                                                |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=442.6)   | I've always had Gaussian.                                                                          |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=443.6)   | Me neither.                                                                                        |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=444.6)   | If you want your shadows to have no blur and just be a solid mark, you can set the blur            |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=449.48)  | to zero or omit it entirely.                                                                       |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=452.16)  | And blur actually comes numerically before spread.                                                 |
| [07:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=455.4)   | So when you're writing this in the box shadow property, if you want to omit the blur, you          |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=459.56)  | also have to omit the spread.                                                                      |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=461.74)  | So it's usually just safer to write out all your values since box shadow is a shorthand            |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=466.44)  | for all of these internals.                                                                        |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=468.88)  | You don't have all these separated out into individual values and you can even animate             |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=473.12)  | blur.                                                                                              |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=474.12)  | So if you had something blurred from zero to a value on an interactive element, you                |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=478.88)  | could do that.                                                                                     |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=479.88)  | And it can look really neat.                                                                       |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=480.88)  | Yeah, I strongly agree.                                                                            |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=482.62)  | You also have the option to change the shadow color, right?                                        |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=485.92)  | You got to pick a color for your shadow.                                                           |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=487.66)  | Most people probably choose black because that's the easy way out here.                            |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=491.6)   | But pro tip, no shadows in the world are black.                                                    |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=494.76)  | Anyway, just a fun tip.                                                                            |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=496.7)   | Pro tip number two, though, more pro tips is that you can make a soft shadow without               |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=500.52)  | opacity.                                                                                           |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=501.6)   | So it's more common that people will be like, we'll do a black shadow at 20 percent opacity.       |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=506.4)   | And I agree, that looks pretty good, but you can do better.                                        |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=509.54)  | Or you can even try this other technique, which I've enjoyed using, which is HSL to                |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=513.52)  | pick a color that's just darker than the background.                                               |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=516.12)  | So it'd be like a really dark gray that I use for my shadow.                                       |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=519.32)  | But then it's the same hue and tone that's coming from the background.                             |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=522.2)   | And so the colors don't look like they're clashing as much.                                        |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=524.08)  | It can look more natural.                                                                          |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=525.56)  | And you can get away with the shadow with no opacity.                                              |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=528.32)  | So might be able to save you some render times in case you have a lot of box shadows on the        |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=531.88)  | page.                                                                                              |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=532.88)  | You're a little worried about opacity causing render issues.                                       |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=535.98)  | Funny thing about color too in the box shadow is if you don't pass a color, it uses current        |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=540.12)  | color.                                                                                             |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=541.12)  | It will use the current text color.                                                                |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=542.12)  | That could be handy with a button where the text color is blue on like a white button.             |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=545.76)  | And you could have a cool blue shadow that you get for free because the color inherited            |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=549.22)  | from the button color.                                                                             |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=550.22)  | So every color in your design system could just inherit from the text color and have               |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=553.76)  | this neat little theming that you get for free.                                                    |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=556.36)  | Kind of cool box shadow color.                                                                     |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=558.12)  | Yeah, just like with border too.                                                                   |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=560.56)  | So you can have unlimited shadows on an element if you wanted to with a comma separated list       |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=566.06)  | of shadow values denoting when one shadow ends and next begins.                                    |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=571.04)  | I will say that having a lot of shadows isn't amazing for rendering performance in the browser,    |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=576.42)  | but you can do some really fun artistic things with multiple shadows.                              |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=580.52)  | And an example of that is something that I was playing with five years ago now.                    |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=585.48)  | It's crazy that it's been that long ago, but there's this article that we'll share                 |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=588.48)  | on the show that's called Sass Pixel Art.                                                          |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=590.4)   | And it was published on May 3, 2015.                                                               |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=592.68)  | And I'm just like, wow, that's so old.                                                             |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=596.08)  | I'm an old.                                                                                        |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=597.08)  | I'm officially an old.                                                                             |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=598.84)  | So what I was doing here is creating these multiple box shadows to represent pixels.               |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=605.82)  | And so as I mentioned earlier, the box shadow will take the size of the parent element.            |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=609.52)  | So if you had an element that was like 20 pixels by 20 pixels, then the box shadows                |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=614.76)  | will take that size.                                                                               |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=616.16)  | And you can use that value of 20 pixels as a variable for pushing the position of the              |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=621.88)  | box shadows.                                                                                       |
| [10:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=622.88)  | So you can sort of place it at the xy coordinate scale based on the parent size.                   |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=628.56)  | So you get like this nice ability to position.                                                     |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=631.68)  | So if I had the parent element being 20 pixels in size, then if I had the box shadow appearing     |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=637.88)  | at 20px, 20px, 40px, 40px, and 60px, 60px, it would be like a diagonal line.                       |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=644.02)  | And for all of this pixel art, I just had no spread and no blur.                                   |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=648.22)  | So it just looked like a box.                                                                      |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=649.86)  | And the next thing I did was created a matrix in Sass, which you could do to visually create       |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=657.32)  | a pixel that used a character, a keyboard letter, to draw a color value and read from              |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=664.76)  | a list to then apply that color value to then create the shadow.                                   |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=669.32)  | You can use transparent as a shadow color.                                                         |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=672.16)  | So what this actually did was read this list.                                                      |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=674.92)  | And one of the color values that I had included was a transparent.                                 |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=678.0)   | So I used like O to represent that.                                                                |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=680.36)  | And so you can just draw out these entire images like art with box shadows.                        |
| [11:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=686.42)  | These are hundreds of shadows that you're using.                                                   |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=689.44)  | I was doing like Mario art.                                                                        |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=691.32)  | And then just to play around with it, it's like border radius 50% on the parents.                  |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=695.6)   | And that then made all the shadows rounded.                                                        |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=697.96)  | So like that was a different type of effect that felt like a retro like Lichtenstein dotted        |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=703.72)  | cartoony vibe.                                                                                     |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=705.52)  | So there is a lot of fun things you could do with box shadows.                                     |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=708.56)  | Definitely not like a production thing, but something that is fun to explore and just              |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=713.88)  | stretch your CSS prowess.                                                                          |
| [11:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=716.2)   | Definitely agree.                                                                                  |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=717.2)   | Sometimes when people make CSS only art or one div elements, they're usually using some            |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=722.64)  | sort of technique like this, right, where they're taking multiple background images                |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=725.76)  | and stacking them together to make a single piece of art.                                          |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=728.48)  | It's really cool.                                                                                  |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=729.48)  | I found a tool while doing some research for this as well.                                         |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=732.0)   | It's called image to CSS converter.                                                                |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=734.04)  | Note, this is not for production, at least in my opinion, but it'll basically open up              |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=738.16)  | your image and look at each pixel and swap a pixel for a box and draw out the whole image          |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=743.1)   | until you have vector bit art.                                                                     |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=745.06)  | So you'll have this image that looks very, very similar, if not the same to the original           |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=748.9)   | pixel art.                                                                                         |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=749.9)   | But if you zoom in, they're actual little squares.                                                 |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=751.76)  | So that's kind of a cool tool.                                                                     |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=752.92)  | That's unreal.                                                                                     |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=753.92)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=754.92)  | I mean, it kind of makes sense when you think about it.                                            |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=756.72)  | Like, right, if you're just going pixel by pixel and you automate it, that's pretty sweet.         |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=760.28)  | So nice little node process to get that done.                                                      |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=763.16)  | And then the last tip with multiple backgrounds is I've been getting really into they're called    |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=767.48)  | easing.                                                                                            |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=768.48)  | It's like shadow easing.                                                                           |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=769.6)   | But the reality of the technique is you want to have a softer shadow that looks more realistic.    |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=773.6)   | And in the real world, you don't usually have a single source of light.                            |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=776.56)  | You've got ambient light coming from the sun and all your windows, lights in your ceiling,         |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=780.58)  | maybe lights from devices, all these things kind of casting different light directions.            |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=783.94)  | And so what I like about this easing tool, which we'll have in the show notes, it allows           |
| [13:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=787.64)  | you to kind of specify a shadow that will, let's say you want five shadows across this             |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=793.1)   | certain depth.                                                                                     |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=794.32)  | It will do the blending for them so that they look really soft.                                    |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=797.64)  | You get this shadow effect that you can't get from a single shadow.                                |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=801.64)  | And it does it through a repetition of color, position and blur.                                   |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=805.76)  | And it automates it and gives you some tools to modify it.                                         |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=808.0)   | Anyway, you get these really long, really smooth, multiple light sourced emulated shadows.         |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=813.42)  | And ultimately, I think they just look amazing.                                                    |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=815.7)   | So find that in the show notes, multiple backgrounds, so many cool uses for it.                    |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=819.6)   | Can't believe it.                                                                                  |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=820.6)   | CSS, have I told you recently, you're amazing.                                                     |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=823.68)  | Anyway.                                                                                            |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=824.68)  | Yeah, I've actually showed me this multiple box shadow effect and this tool recently on            |
| [13:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=829.16)  | a project we're working on, and it really makes a difference.                                      |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=832.24)  | I had always thought, oh, you could just spread a shadow out and you could apply blur in a         |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=837.12)  | specific way.                                                                                      |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=838.12)  | But having multiple shadows really does create a much smoother aesthetic to the shadows that       |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=844.0)   | you include on the page.                                                                           |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=845.0)   | That's pretty cool.                                                                                |
| [14:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=846.0)   | Definitely check out some of these tools.                                                          |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=847.54)  | So there's box shadow, and then there's also text shadows.                                         |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=851.28)  | And so for text shadows, values are interpreted as box shadows, except the inset value and         |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=857.06)  | spread are not allowed.                                                                            |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=858.76)  | And they appear on text.                                                                           |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=860.6)   | So you could add like a text shadow to a paragraph.                                                |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=863.36)  | Unlike box shadow, text shadows are not clipped to the shadowed shape and may show through         |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=869.24)  | if the text is partially transparent.                                                              |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=871.64)  | So if you had the color of your text have an alpha value, you could see the shadow behind          |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=877.12)  | it.                                                                                                |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=878.12)  | Like box shadow, text shadows do not influence the layout and don't trigger scrolling or           |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=883.22)  | increase the size of the scrollable overflow area.                                                 |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=887.0)   | And so when you write your text shadows, you can start again with the position, the X and          |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=890.92)  | Y coordinates are going to go from the top down with the X and Y being positive.                   |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=897.52)  | And then again, like box shadow, the negative values will be left and up.                          |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=902.4)   | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=903.4)   | It'll go positive is going to the right and down and negative is to the left and up.               |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=907.44)  | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=908.44)  | Yep, yep.                                                                                          |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=909.44)  | Very nice.                                                                                         |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=910.48)  | So then with text shadows, you can also blur them.                                                 |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=912.56)  | It's neat to know you can't pass any negative numbers here.                                        |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=915.08)  | But it's a lot like box shadow where a higher number is a blur your edge.                          |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=918.44)  | And I found with the text shadow usage I have in the past that a lot of times I have a very,       |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=922.52)  | very light to little to no blur.                                                                   |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=925.04)  | And that's so that I can get a nice sharp kind of contrast.                                        |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=928.36)  | But anyway, there's lots of fun techniques with blur in your text shadow.                          |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=931.12)  | Yeah, color, again, pretty straightforward.                                                        |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=933.0)   | Like with box shadow, if the color of the shadow isn't specified, it defaults to current           |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=937.84)  | color.                                                                                             |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=938.84)  | So the text shadows color will be taken from the elements color property, which is also            |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=944.06)  | text in this case.                                                                                 |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=945.3)   | So it's usually not very legible.                                                                  |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=947.32)  | So you'll probably want to specify either a different text shadow color, or you could              |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=952.84)  | really blur it out so that it's a little bit lighter than the base color.                          |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=956.86)  | But even then, like why?                                                                           |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=958.76)  | With text shadow, you really have to be careful about the color that you pick to make sure         |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=962.72)  | that it doesn't make the text visually illegible.                                                  |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=966.88)  | So yeah, it might be a good idea to choose a color with some alpha transparency or something       |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=971.0)   | that is much different than the text that it is being applied to.                                  |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=975.24)  | Yeah, I wish that accessibility contrasts when it looked at it, if it understood text              |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=981.04)  | shadows, like if you could put a white text shadow underneath, you know, some text to              |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=985.4)   | make it pop off of a darker background, you just get this like little, little amount of            |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=989.54)  | thin hairline contrast.                                                                            |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=991.68)  | I don't know.                                                                                      |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=992.68)  | Yeah, it's just wishful thinking.                                                                  |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=993.96)  | I've done that before with light text, I would apply a slight dark shadow like a black shadow      |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1000.6)  | around it, just so it helped with the legibility.                                                  |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1004.08) | So it can help.                                                                                    |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1005.2)  | I think subtlety is key here, because then it could go wrong very quickly.                         |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1009.86) | It can go wrong really quickly.                                                                    |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1011.02) | And sometimes you want that.                                                                       |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1012.12) | And so let's talk about multiple text shadows.                                                     |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1014.4)  | Because it could go wrong and that you could make the Wayne's World intro, right?                  |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1018.92) | Where it's like, Wayne's World, Wayne's World, and you have like four different text shadows       |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1022.34) | of different colors that are sort of like animating from corner to corner.                         |
| [17:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1025.44) | You can totally do that with text shadows, you can get that like retro 80s and 90s look.           |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1029.94) | But then there was a technique that was really hot for a while when I was at agencies.             |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1033.94) | And this was like when iPhone one came out.                                                        |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1036.02) | And if you remember, iPhone one was all skeuomorphic and all the text looked like it was etched    |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1040.04) | into the document.                                                                                 |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1042.34) | We accomplished that with text shadow, we'd have a text shadow that was one pixel offset           |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1045.72) | y up and another text shadows offset pixel y down.                                                 |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1049.6)  | And we could either make the text look inset into the page or outset from the page by using        |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1054.02) | these light and dark kind of hints to your eye.                                                    |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1057.88) | And they were really subtle.                                                                       |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1058.88) | And I used to love it.                                                                             |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1059.88) | It was the coolest look and made all this text look all shiny, almost like we had a                |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1062.96) | metal plate and we'd gone through and etched all the text into it or something.                    |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1066.44) | But that, you know, trend has died.                                                                |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1068.76) | It's fun to note with multiple backgrounds that they do apply from the front to the back.          |
| [17:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1072.9)  | So there's an order.                                                                               |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1073.9)  | And that can be really something that you can take advantage of.                                   |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1076.4)  | And in case you haven't seen any of these really amazing 3d text demos that people do              |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1080.4)  | a text shadow.                                                                                     |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1081.92) | There's one in the show notes.                                                                     |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1083.2)  | It's kind of incredible.                                                                           |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1084.76) | The quality of it is very high.                                                                    |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1086.6)  | It's very realistic.                                                                               |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1087.88) | And it's just a text shadow trick.                                                                 |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1089.92) | It's super neat.                                                                                   |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1090.92) | So look for that one in the show notes.                                                            |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1093.24) | I've also seen some really fun demos.                                                              |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1095.36) | There was a company that Dave deSandro ran that was called Metafizzy.                              |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1099.38) | And this logo had one of those like multiple vivid bright drop shadows, like multiple shadows      |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1106.0)  | on a sort of logo, like just a typeface.                                                           |
| [18:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1110.28) | And I thought it was so fun.                                                                       |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1111.8)  | Like I love this.                                                                                  |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1112.8)  | And it was animated and it was, it was great.                                                      |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1115.76) | So these can be also used for fun, just like the multiple shadows with the box shadows.            |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1121.52) | Finally we can't end a shadow episode without talking about drop shadows.                          |
| [18:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1124.98) | Drop shadows are different than box and text shadows because they are not a CSS property.          |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1132.4)  | They're actually an argument on the right side of the filter property.                             |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1136.48) | So drop shadows are actually a CSS filter function and they take the same values as                |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1141.72) | box shadow.                                                                                        |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1142.8)  | You enter a box shadow syntax into the filter function, but these are arguments within that        |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1150.68) | function.                                                                                          |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1151.68) | So it looks like drop shadow in the in parentheses, offset X offset Y, the blur radius, the spread |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1156.92) | radius and the color.                                                                              |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1158.6)  | And you could write this with a space separated list of other filters or use it on its own.        |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1163.0)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [19:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1164.0)  | And notice the name is drop shadow and not box shadow.                                             |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1166.94) | And these can easily be confused and you're like, well, what's the difference?                     |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1170.0)  | And it's in the name, but maybe the subtlety is kind of lost.                                      |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1172.76) | Like a box shadow is going to be dropping off of your content box.                                 |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1177.64) | So we're talking about the box model.                                                              |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1179.6)  | Let's say we have a border radius on there.                                                        |
| [19:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1181.44) | The border radius would affect the box shadow.                                                     |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1183.82) | And so you'd get a box shadow that had a rounded corner.                                           |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1186.4)  | Now if you wanted a box shadow on something like a triangle, you would be quite sad because        |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1191.62) | the box model is always a box.                                                                     |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1194.18) | And so in order to get a box shadow that looks like a triangle, you have to use the drop           |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1198.92) | shadow.                                                                                            |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1199.96) | Drop shadow is much more intelligently contextual to the like painted space of the element.        |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1205.76) | So that's the difference.                                                                          |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1206.76) | A drop shadow is relevant to the painted space.                                                    |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1208.44) | A box shadow is relevant to the box space.                                                         |
| [20:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1211.58) | Now there's a big difference between box shadow and drop shadow.                                   |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1214.28) | And it makes me cry because it doesn't have spread.                                                |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1218.16) | You cannot spread.                                                                                 |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1219.16) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [20:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1220.16) | And I know, right?                                                                                 |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1221.16) | I was, oh, look at my love for the box shadow spread.                                              |
| [20:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1223.1)  | Let's talk about drop shadow.                                                                      |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1224.1)  | Oh crap.                                                                                           |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1225.58) | That's not supported.                                                                              |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1226.58) | So you can't do spread, but that's okay.                                                           |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1228.52) | You can sort of get away with even cooler effects with drop shadow.                                |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1232.3)  | And that's the difference between box shadow and drop shadow.                                      |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1234.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |

| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uKRf077iHI4aWPjIHpeey?&t=1236.6)  | We went through box shadow, drop shadow, text shadow.                                              |
