| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast, where we break down what's happening on the web               |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=16.64)   | platform for CSS and UI.                                                                            |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=18.6)    | Today is an exciting episode because we're talking about one of the most highly requested           |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=23.08)   | functionalities for CSS selectors, being able to style a parent based on its children.              |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=29.64)   | To make it even more exciting, this feature just landed in stable versions of both Chromium         |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=34.48)   | and WebKit, and you can polyfill it using PostCSS.                                                  |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=38.42)   | The feature I am talking about, of course, is the HasSelector.                                      |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=42.92)   | Has is a part of Selectors Level 4, the same spec as Not, Is, and Where.                            |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=48.4)    | Together, these form the logical combinations section of this very packed CSS specification,        |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=54.88)   | and we've also talked about a few of these CSS functions in previous episodes.                      |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=59.04)   | The logical combinations, almost sounds like some super friends, like they fly in, they're          |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=63.44)   | like, the logical combinations are here, do do do do.                                               |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=66.28)   | The nerdy super friends.                                                                            |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=67.84)   | The nerdy super friends, or the super family.                                                       |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=70.76)   | Ooh, maybe that's what we'll get to because this is...                                              |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=73.06)   | Super family.                                                                                       |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=74.06)   | Oh, we'll get there in a sec.                                                                       |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=75.24)   | So the HasSelector has been called the parent selector for many, many years, but it's so            |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=81.68)   | much more than that.                                                                                |
| [01:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=82.92)   | Jay Tompkins, a colleague of ours, just called it the family selector.                              |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=86.4)    | That's why we were giggling a second ago.                                                           |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=87.72)   | We called it, which is really cute to call it the family selector, in a recent article              |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=92.32)   | that they wrote on developer.chrome.com, because it lets you select either parents and or children. |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=98.2)    | Just depends on what-                                                                               |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=99.2)    | Or anyone in the family, really.                                                                    |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=100.2)   | Anyone in the family.                                                                               |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=101.2)   | Select a family member.                                                                             |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=102.2)   | It just depends on where you put the has.                                                           |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=104.48)  | But I like to think of it like a subject switcher.                                                  |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=106.92)  | We finally don't have to select the element at the end of a selector.                               |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=110.7)   | You can target the first element, a middle element, or whatever, any member of the family.          |
| [01:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=115.56)  | You have much finer control over the subject of the selector.                                       |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=119.04)  | Has can appear in the selector wherever you see not, is, and where.                                 |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=122.68)  | So has also turns every single stateful CSS selector into a powerful hook for you to visually       |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=128.16)  | represent in your UI.                                                                               |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=129.68)  | There's hover, focus within, focus visible, valid, invalid, checked, target, visited,               |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=134.48)  | disabled, optional, required for child, last child, plus, is, not, and where.                       |
| [02:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=138.6)   | And that's just to name a few.                                                                      |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=140.56)  | Check the show notes for a link on our Learn CSS Content page on PseudoClasses.                     |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=144.4)   | It's got a full list of all the things that has can empower in your UI.                             |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=149.16)  | Has is so powerful, honestly.                                                                       |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=150.8)   | This really changes the way that we write code.                                                     |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=153.94)  | You can use has concurrently, such as chaining has.                                                 |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=156.92)  | So you could do has, like colon has in the rules, and then has again next to it.                    |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=162.04)  | But you can't use a has within another has.                                                         |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=165.2)   | So you would write it like, say you have a link and you want a colon has, and then in               |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=170.4)   | parentheses span, this would style a link that has a span element inside of it.                     |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=176.76)  | As Adam also mentioned earlier, you could style any of the children of that parent element          |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=182.04)  | using has.                                                                                          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=183.12)  | So the way that you would do that is you could write something like a colon has in parentheses      |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=188.56)  | span, which would select that link that has span.                                                   |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=192.28)  | But then if you have a space dot icon, you're styling the icon element within the link that         |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=199.24)  | has a span.                                                                                         |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=200.86)  | So the list really goes on and on.                                                                  |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=203.26)  | And there are so many other great examples.                                                         |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=206.2)   | But I think the best way to talk about just how powerful this feature is, is to show our            |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=211.28)  | audience some of the use cases and ways that they can use has with demos, real examples.            |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=216.62)  | So do you want to kick it off, Adam?                                                                |
| [03:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=218.08)  | Oh, you know, I do.                                                                                 |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=219.56)  | All right.                                                                                          |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=220.56)  | The first one is, is let's select figures that have fig captions.                                   |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=225.44)  | And so you would do that by figure colon has open parentheses, fig caption and the parentheses.     |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=230.8)   | This is a good example of where has gets that parent selector name because I'm definitely           |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=234.78)  | selecting the parent if it has a caption.                                                           |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=238.04)  | With the selector, though, I can easily manage the space to be allocated for the caption.           |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=242.32)  | Like, like make way, this figure has a fig caption.                                                 |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=245.66)  | It needs some padding, you know, so anyway, it's kind of cool.                                      |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=248.6)   | Yeah, that's super useful because then the way it interacts with the rest of the page,              |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=252.56)  | you need to make sure that it looks okay and that there's some affordance, especially if            |
| [04:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=257.04)  | you're styling things that don't have captions along with things that do.                           |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=260.64)  | So very, very useful.                                                                               |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=263.16)  | So similarly, there's card has image.                                                               |
| [04:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=266.04)  | So you could have a card and then check if it has an image.                                         |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=269.2)   | So say you have a set of articles and article cards, and some of them would have a preview          |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=274.4)   | image and some of them don't.                                                                       |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=276.3)   | Maybe the ones that don't have an image, you want the text to be larger so that it takes            |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=280.02)  | up more space and that it kind of replaces the image with typography.                               |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=284.48)  | You could write dot card colon has and then in parentheses image space h2 and then style            |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=291.12)  | the header of that card if it has an image or if it has an image.                                   |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=296.44)  | You'd want to use not here.                                                                         |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=297.44)  | You'd want to use card colon not colon has image h2 and make that text larger or you                |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=304.2)   | would do the opposite.                                                                              |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=305.2)   | Sorry, getting confused.                                                                            |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=306.2)   | But you can combine some not.                                                                       |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=307.96)  | I've done this.                                                                                     |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=309.2)   | It's really, really convenient to style things that you want to kind of give them equal weight      |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=314.8)   | but they have different children.                                                                   |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=317.24)  | And it's just one more way to kind of style your UI with has.                                       |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=320.36)  | Totally.                                                                                            |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=321.36)  | That card could also switch to like a horizontal layout to make room for the bigger headline        |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=325.46)  | or be a portrait layout when it has an image.                                                       |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=328.16)  | All sorts of cool stuff.                                                                            |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=330.36)  | Excellent explanation.                                                                              |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=331.36)  | Here's another one.                                                                                 |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=333.24)  | Like what if a form has an invalid entry?                                                           |
| [05:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=336.48)  | So this one's from Jay's article.                                                                   |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=339.08)  | This is kind of cool.                                                                               |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=340.08)  | You can change a form group or the whole form itself based on that state of some of its             |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=344.12)  | children.                                                                                           |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=345.12)  | Remember we were talking earlier about like invalid, valid.                                         |
| [05:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=347.24)  | These are form element states that CSS knows about.                                                 |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=350.4)   | Well, you can use those inside of has.                                                              |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=352.2)   | And so imagine you have like dot form dash group.                                                   |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=354.82)  | So this is like some group of inputs and you say colon has, open your parentheses and then          |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=360.12)  | say colon invalid.                                                                                  |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=361.12)  | So you're going to select the form group that has any invalid inputs inside of it and then          |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=366.4)   | you can go space form group error, you can find the error element that you currently                |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=371.04)  | have display hidden and set it to display block.                                                    |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=374.0)   | So if this form group has an invalid input, show the error block.                                   |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=379.08)  | Kind of cool.                                                                                       |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=380.08)  | And you can do that all without JavaScript.                                                         |
| [06:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=381.08)  | Really, really useful.                                                                              |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=382.6)   | And it's a great way to kind of the statefulness that you can query with has is really useful.      |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=388.88)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=389.88)  | It gets cooler too.                                                                                 |
| [06:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=391.2)   | So that's handy to sort of toggle if it's invalid or not, but we can enhance it with                |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=396.36)  | even more pseudo classes.                                                                           |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=398.16)  | So let's make it so that the input error only shows when the input isn't focused.                   |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=404.16)  | So you can say dot form dash group colon has invalid colon not focus.                               |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=409.54)  | And then you finish out your selector.                                                              |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=410.86)  | So now you're qualifying not just invalid inputs, but invalid inputs that are not being             |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=415.92)  | focused so that the blur, like the focus has left, the user is not putting any input into           |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=421.24)  | that.                                                                                               |
| [07:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=422.24)  | So show them the error then, but while they're typing in it, don't show them the error.             |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=425.88)  | So kind of cool that you have all these little hooks to do really powerful UI adjustments.          |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=432.16)  | I love that too, because you're not yelling at your user while they're actively trying              |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=435.16)  | to fix it.                                                                                          |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=436.16)  | It's only when there's an error once they've stopped entering and interacting.                      |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=441.34)  | So speaking about state, another great example from that article that Jay wrote is menu expansion.  |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=447.84)  | So you could actually query has on the root, which is a really great way to kind of look            |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=453.48)  | at your entire page as a whole and style the body.                                                  |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=455.92)  | So the way that this would work is say you have a menu that comes in from the left hand             |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=460.86)  | side or the right hand side, and you want to physically move your page, like a push                 |
| [07:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=464.24)  | menu.                                                                                               |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=465.24)  | A way that you can do that is by using has with something like aria-expanded and look               |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=470.5)   | for an aria-expanded state.                                                                         |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=472.48)  | So maybe that exists on the nav element.                                                            |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=476.06)  | You can query colon root colon has and in parentheses nav, and then with brackets aria-expanded     |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=482.78)  | equals true.                                                                                        |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=484.36)  | And now we're querying for if there is a nav present with aria-expanded true on the nav             |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=492.76)  | within a root.                                                                                      |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=494.52)  | And you can update in this example, Jay's updating the custom property of open to one               |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=500.64)  | and then on the body using a transform function to set the transform from essentially going         |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=506.58)  | from zero to doing some calculations and math to move it negative 200 pixels.                       |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=512.32)  | And check out the article for the actual code.                                                      |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=514.48)  | I'm not going to read out loud.                                                                     |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=515.48)  | It's kind of weird of a podcast, but the functionality here is super cool where you can check for   |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=519.94)  | the existence of an expanded state in a nav, in a root and apply styles to the body that            |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=526.2)   | way.                                                                                                |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=527.2)   | Yeah, that's a cool example because it sort of abstracts touching DOM like what we were             |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=531.6)   | doing earlier.                                                                                      |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=532.6)   | Like we were setting display none and stuff like that.                                              |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=534.16)  | And this is more like you're toggling custom properties based on states of your elements            |

| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=541.32)  | Because any child can then change the global state and anything that's interested in that           |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=545.64)  | global state can update and react.                                                                  |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=547.36)  | It's a reactive programming paradigm.                                                               |

| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=574.96)  | I mean, anyway, back to CSS away from the Baratheons and the Targaryens or whatever.                |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=580.44)  | Let's talk about another use case for has.                                                          |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=583.24)  | So there's a concept called quantity queries.                                                       |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=585.32)  | I think we've talked about it in an episode before, but I saw Michelle Barker use this              |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=589.34)  | and it was really, really cool.                                                                     |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=590.76)  | So have you ever wanted to change your layout depending on how many children it has?                |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=594.6)   | Well, you can do that now.                                                                          |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=597.08)  | So you could say like dot grid, so just select your grid or whatever.                               |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=599.84)  | And remember, we want to select the grid and then change its layout.                                |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=604.0)   | So we're not going to select any children.                                                          |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=605.48)  | We do want the parent.                                                                              |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=606.64)  | So we'll say dot grid colon has, and then in there we'll say colon last child colon                 |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=611.5)   | nth child five, end your parentheses.                                                               |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=614.52)  | And this is a tricky way of saying select the grid class elements that have a last child            |
| [10:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=618.52)  | that's a fifth child.                                                                               |
| [10:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=619.94)  | So it'll only be true if there are five total children and that last child is the fifth             |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=625.68)  | one.                                                                                                |
| [10:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=626.68)  | So that's super cool and tricky.                                                                    |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=627.76)  | And you can enhance it by switching the subject from the grid to the first child and give           |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=632.12)  | it a promoted layout since it's an odd number of items.                                             |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=634.52)  | So we selected this grid if it has five items.                                                      |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=637.88)  | That's going to be frustrating because we're going to have one that's kind of solo.                 |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=640.28)  | Well, we can use that same selector, hit space after it.                                            |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=643.6)   | So we're not targeting the grid anymore.                                                            |
| [10:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=645.58)  | Target the first child and give it a full width.                                                    |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=648.18)  | So now I have a full width upper row with a grid of four items right below it, all using            |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=653.28)  | has looking at your quantity of your items and it's super cool.                                     |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=657.4)   | This quantity query syntax I learned from Michelle Barker, like I was saying, but there's also      |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=661.22)  | Hayden Pickering's original one from 2015 and we'll have links in the show notes to                 |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=664.76)  | both of these examples, but super cool.                                                             |
| [11:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=667.14)  | Change your layout based on the number of children you have.                                        |
| [11:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=669.56)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=670.56)  | And taking that even further, you could also use affordances from nth children like even            |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=675.68)  | or odd to change the layout based on even or odd children.                                          |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=679.44)  | So the number of children is one thing you might want to do where you might have a set              |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=684.12)  | style for different screen sizes based on how big you want.                                         |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=688.44)  | I don't know those elements.                                                                        |
| [11:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=689.8)   | I use cards as my default to be, but you can also create layout changes based on if something       |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=695.8)   | has even or odd children.                                                                           |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=697.56)  | So the logic of this is really expanding.                                                           |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=700.04)  | And the way that you would do that is using nth again and child syntax where you would              |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=705.0)   | check if a container has, and then you can use that sibling selector or the direct descendant       |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=710.64)  | selector inside of the has query.                                                                   |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=713.8)   | You could do the direct descendant and then space and then the items that you're looking            |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=716.72)  | at last of type nth of type odd.                                                                    |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=720.4)   | And this would tell you if there is the presence of the odd total number of children or not.        |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=727.2)   | And then you could also use not to get even or use even and that'd be the keyword.                  |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=731.0)   | So it, so many ways to do this.                                                                     |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=733.4)   | Again, right, like that long list of pseudo classes.                                                |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=735.96)  | Look at these clever and creative ways to use them.                                                 |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=738.52)  | It's just amazing.                                                                                  |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=739.52)  | This is one of my favorite things in CSS right now is clever ways to do has selection.              |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=744.72)  | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=745.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=746.72)  | We're barely scratching the surface, aren't we?                                                     |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=748.2)   | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=749.2)   | Well, let's, what about a theme swapper?                                                            |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=750.88)  | You got light dark, maybe grape.                                                                    |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=753.48)  | You know, I like the grape theme.                                                                   |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=754.64)  | It's always been a fun one in my demos and you can make a theme swapper as well.                    |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=758.28)  | So again, from Jay's article, he's got a great demo on how to do this.                              |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=760.76)  | You can say colon root colon has dot theme button is aria-pressed equals true.                      |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=765.64)  | So whatever theme it is, if it's pressed, you can change a custom property on the root              |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=770.64)  | and you can say like dash dash dark mode true and use that custom property throughout the           |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=775.16)  | rest of your styles to go update to a dark mode.                                                    |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=778.0)   | Yep.                                                                                                |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=779.0)   | One of my other favorite things to do with has is combined with container queries.                  |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=783.96)  | Oh yeah.                                                                                            |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=784.96)  | So container queries are also landing in stable browsers and there's a polyfill for them,           |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=790.4)   | but before I was talking about the card and how you can do some really nice things where            |
| [13:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=795.36)  | you are querying to see if a card has an image, for example, and then applying styles for           |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=800.56)  | the layout or even the sizing of the other elements like the headers, you can now combine           |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=805.6)   | this with container queries and apply styles using the intrinsic size of the card combined          |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=813.48)  | with if it has things.                                                                              |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=814.48)  | So you could write like a container query, like at container, and then if it has a minimum          |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=819.16)  | width and then if it has an image inside of it, then you apply the styles.                          |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=824.92)  | So that gets even more powerful with container queries and has and container queries are            |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=830.84)  | both landing in the same version of Chromium.                                                       |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=833.02)  | So I wrote an article about how to use them together combined as this powerhouse for responsive     |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=837.56)  | design and it's just such an exciting time to be a developer.                                       |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=841.68)  | That really triggered a thought process for me too, where a lot of the new CSS stuff that's         |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=846.84)  | coming is about ownership and it's like centralizing ownership so it's not so scattered amongst     |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=851.2)   | these things.                                                                                       |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=852.2)   | Has is totally bringing even more of that, right?                                                   |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=854.84)  | So we get to the container can own more because it can adapt itself based on its children           |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=860.2)   | instead of children trying to inform the parent or being defensive somehow against a multitude      |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=865.28)  | of scenarios.                                                                                       |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=866.28)  | You can now grab hold.                                                                              |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=867.42)  | I think this is huge for design systems.                                                            |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=868.92)  | I can't wait to see what folks do with it there.                                                    |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=871.16)  | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=872.16)  | And that's why people have needed this more and more because the way that we build websites         |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=876.16)  | today, we often are using frameworks.                                                               |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=878.44)  | We're using component based systems with reusable UI elements.                                      |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=882.96)  | And before these features, before container queries and has, you didn't really have a               |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=887.36)  | way to have your element own its responsive logic.                                                  |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=890.28)  | It still relied on global information, the page.                                                    |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=893.58)  | You're looking at things still as page layouts, not as components that are reusable, that           |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=898.88)  | are really resilient.                                                                               |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=899.88)  | They're sort of things that you can kind of put anywhere and know that they will look               |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=903.4)   | like you want them to because they own their logical information.                                   |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=907.2)   | And this is just one more way to write that logical information.                                    |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=911.32)  | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=912.32)  | Like, so let's say if you have PHP that's rendering a grid on your homepage and it's                |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=916.88)  | currently counting the length of items that gets back from the database and trying to               |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=920.12)  | make it an intelligent grid layout for it.                                                          |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=922.84)  | We'll cut that out, get that out your PHP and put it in your CSS.                                   |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=927.12)  | Use has, has can now do this live on the client based on the viewport.                              |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=930.74)  | You know, you don't just have to count how many items are on there, you could do so much            |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=934.64)  | more.                                                                                               |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=935.64)  | So this is huge.                                                                                    |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=936.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=937.64)  | And you don't always know what the UI is going to end up looking like if you're using a database    |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=940.42)  | system to populate your website.                                                                    |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=942.8)   | And that's why you need some logic in CSS.                                                          |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=945.44)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=946.44)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=947.44)  | All right.                                                                                          |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=948.44)  | We're, we're totally not amped on this at all.                                                      |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=949.56)  | So we have so many more examples.                                                                   |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=952.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=953.16)  | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=954.16)  | So let's say you want to prevent the background page from scrolling when a dialogue is open,        |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=956.4)   | right?                                                                                              |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=957.4)   | You don't want to be able to scroll that background.                                                |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=958.64)  | That's annoying.                                                                                    |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=959.64)  | It's supposed to be inert.                                                                          |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=960.64)  | I think it'd be frozen, but anyway, you can say HTML colon has open parentheses, dialogue           |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=966.48)  | bracket open.                                                                                       |
| [16:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=967.8)   | So if the dialogue has the open attribute on it, which means somebody called show on                |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=971.44)  | it, you can target the HTML document and set overflow to hidden.                                    |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=974.96)  | So they can't scroll the page while the dialogue is open.                                           |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=977.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=978.48)  | Another nice staple one.                                                                            |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=979.6)   | I really like this idea of responsive UI components, things as small as buttons, and you can use    |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=986.24)  | has to style things like buttons differently based on their content.                                |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=991.16)  | So you can look for an SVG, you can do button colon has SVG or has an icon, and then you            |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=997.2)   | can apply different styles depending on if it has additional contents within the button.            |
| [16:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1002.68) | This is pretty common in design systems too.                                                        |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1004.48) | You have like your icon buttons separate from your regular buttons, and now you don't have          |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1007.96) | to give a different class name.                                                                     |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1009.22) | You could just use has and style things based on the interior content of your button.               |
| [16:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1014.2)  | Again, yeah.                                                                                        |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1015.2)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1016.2)  | You could apply different spacing.                                                                  |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1017.2)  | You know, you would need to do that when you have these different features.                         |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1021.6)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1022.6)  | Ownership again moves into the presentation tier out of your JavaScript, out of your PHP            |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1026.56) | that's trying to look at this button is going to have an icon and do something smart.               |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1030.0)  | You can just make your buttons and let CSS handle it all.                                           |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1033.8)  | Ah, so rad.                                                                                         |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1034.8)  | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1035.8)  | Well, here's another one that people have abused for a long time, which is checkboxes.              |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1039.88) | So using the checkbox checked state, people make games and all sorts of stuff, but those            |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1044.62) | games always required a really lame set of HTML.                                                    |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1048.16) | Oh yeah.                                                                                            |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1049.16) | Because they could only select items that were siblings that came after it and all sorts            |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1053.76) | of like really annoying rules.                                                                      |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1055.32) | Well, they're gone now.                                                                             |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1057.0)  | They're just straight up gone.                                                                      |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1059.36) | Let's say you want to select a form that has a checkbox checked, like someone's agreed              |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1063.18) | to terms or whatever.                                                                               |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1064.72) | Well, you could just say form colon has open parentheses input type equals checkbox is              |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1071.24) | checked.                                                                                            |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1072.24) | So I can check input inside of this form, change my form state, and you could even take             |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1077.72) | it further and check if multiple checkboxes are checked.                                            |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1080.76) | You know, is one checked, two checked, or three checked, all four or whatever, and you              |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1085.1)  | can change your state based on this has is that powerful.                                           |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1088.08) | Yeah, this actually is really exciting because I used to make a lot of CSS games back in            |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1092.36) | the day, and this really unlocks the door to a lot more possibilities.                              |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1096.86) | You know, tilde and plus selectors in selectors, those features in selectors, I mean, so we         |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1103.56) | talked about that in a previous episode.                                                            |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1105.1)  | We have a whole episode on selectors.                                                               |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1107.0)  | I think it's a good episode.                                                                        |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1108.0)  | Definitely check that out to level up your CSS skills.                                              |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1111.12) | So the tilde and the plus and even like the greater than those let you select elements              |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1114.84) | that have siblings or come after a specific element.                                                |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1118.26) | With has you can actually do the opposite.                                                          |
| [18:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1120.32) | You can check if an element has any siblings.                                                       |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1123.42) | So we gave you a lot of examples here about checking if it has children, but this lets              |
| [18:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1128.32) | you check if it has siblings.                                                                       |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1129.96) | And this isn't something that was possible before.                                                  |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1131.88) | We can only select the siblings that came after or the children that came after it.                 |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1136.52) | But again, that subject switching feature of has, let's just grab the first sibling                 |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1142.32) | that we want.                                                                                       |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1143.32) | So we could do like has, and then in parentheses, we can have that plus space div, and this         |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1148.48) | would select an element that has a sibling div.                                                     |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1152.08) | So we can select that first one instead of the following elements, which is super useful            |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1156.9)  | in many cases and wasn't something we could do before.                                              |
| [19:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1159.56) | Yeah, that switch, right?                                                                           |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1161.12) | Because yeah, usually you have to select everything at the end of a selector, but has lets you      |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1165.36) | change the subject into the thing at the beginning.                                                 |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1167.96) | So rad.                                                                                             |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1169.4)  | Another good example, a long time ago.                                                              |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1171.8)  | I mean, it feels like a long time ago.                                                              |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1173.04) | A year ago.                                                                                         |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1174.04) | In like web years.                                                                                  |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1175.04) | But yeah, we had a hashtag on Twitter.                                                              |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1176.4)  | It was a lint HTML with CSS, and it was really fun.                                                 |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1179.44) | You could find a bunch of errors in your page with CSS.                                             |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1183.08) | Well, has allows this to go next level because you can go into, I think about all those great       |
| [19:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1189.24) | pseudo classes we have and all those different form input states and all that stuff, all            |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1193.0)  | these attributes that are required for something to be accessible.                                  |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1195.52) | Well, has can check all of those things and check relationships of children to parents              |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1200.12) | and verify these things and highlight them in red.                                                  |
| [20:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1202.56) | So that was what these selectors would do is we'd write selectors that put a red border             |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1206.62) | around something that was doing something wrong.                                                    |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1209.18) | And so you can go next level with has and keep on linting your HTML with CSS.                       |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1214.4)  | Yeah, that's a good one.                                                                            |
| [20:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1216.32) | Another really cool one is you can animate grid tracks when children are hovered or focused         |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1221.56) | or interacted with in some way.                                                                     |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1223.96) | And a way that you would do that is you could maybe have a grid and then colon has and then         |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1228.8)  | within that you can do the greater than caret and then space and then colon hover and then          |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1234.36) | apply your styles.                                                                                  |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1235.68) | So what we're saying here is that we want to select a direct descendant that if something           |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1241.12) | is hovered, then we are styling the grid and that lets you change the actual grid itself            |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1247.2)  | to change how it looks.                                                                             |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1248.68) | You can give it a different number of rows and columns.                                             |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1251.28) | You could space any children on that grid differently as well.                                      |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1255.2)  | And in the future, we'll have animated grid tracks to do that.                                      |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1258.18) | So it's not just a sharp change.                                                                    |
| [21:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1260.64) | Firefox has already had this for a while.                                                           |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1263.44) | And we'll have it in stable soon and it makes for some really cool interactive UIs where            |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1268.08) | you have a grid changing and different elements taking over the grid and just showing more          |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1272.84) | content or details that way.                                                                        |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1274.92) | We barely scratched the surface on all these possibilities.                                         |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1277.56) | But lastly, you can check support before you use has with at supports.                              |
| [21:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1281.96) | So you can say at supports space selector open parentheses colon has and inside of there            |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1287.72) | put a star and enter parentheses.                                                                   |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1290.22) | And that's it.                                                                                      |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1291.22) | You can use it to upgrade your UI with has it's got a great progressive enhancement story.          |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1295.8)  | Yes.                                                                                                |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1296.8)  | So currently you can use has in Safari 15.4 plus Chromium 105 plus and it is behind a               |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1303.92) | flag in Firefox.                                                                                    |
| [21:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33jiwJcBkml6O43sw7fstA?&t=1305.08) | So hopefully we'll see that soon.                                                                   |
