| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z index.               |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=18.0)    | Today we're going to be talking about functions in CSS.                                                |
| [00:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=21.48)   | Yes, CSS actually has quite a few functions, and we're going to be going over most of                  |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=26.48)   | them in today's show.                                                                                  |
| [00:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=27.48)   | Yeah, you could pretty much do functional programming with CSS.                                        |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=30.48)   | I mean, it's not entirely true, but we are going to be making it sound like there are                  |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=34.36)   | a lot of functions.                                                                                    |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=35.36)   | This is an overview episode and there are a ton in here.                                               |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=38.96)   | So in the beginning, we just want to explain kind of like what is a function and why does              |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=43.12)   | CSS even have these?                                                                                   |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=44.9)    | It turns out they are runtime contextual expressions, and they return dynamic real time values per     |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=51.12)   | the state of the browser per that visitor in that moment.                                              |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=53.88)   | So this is even something I realized as I made this episode that these are very much                   |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=58.36)   | a signal that there is runtime dynamic things happening.                                               |
| [01:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=62.24)   | And so that's why they need to be functions is they're going to be doing things in the                 |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=66.04)   | moment and they take parameters so that you can get some sort of good value back from                  |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=69.44)   | them.                                                                                                  |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=70.44)   | So anyway, I thought that was really interesting that all these functions are pretty much immediate    |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=73.24)   | indicators that there's dynamic styling happening.                                                     |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=76.06)   | So think about that throughout this whole episode.                                                     |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=78.4)    | Interesting thing about a lot of these functions.                                                      |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=79.88)   | So like in JavaScript, you have to import functions, and you don't have to do that and                 |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=83.72)   | CSS they're there in the global space for you.                                                         |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=86.28)   | Many of them can be nested like calc and var where you can put one inside of the other                 |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=89.88)   | or vice versa.                                                                                         |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=91.62)   | Many are typed and will only accept certain parameters.                                                |
| [01:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=94.58)   | So they will fail if you invoke them with the wrong stuff.                                             |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=97.48)   | Some can also type cast so you can pass in various types of parameters and get a new                   |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=102.48)  | type back.                                                                                             |
| [01:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=103.48)  | So calc is a good example of this you can do like 50 times two times one second will                   |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=107.26)  | convert 50 times two to 100 times one second, it'll be 100 seconds.                                    |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=111.66)  | So it's a really cool way for you to do math and then convert to a type that then gets                 |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=115.34)  | used as a value in CSS.                                                                                |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=116.92)  | It can be animated really cool.                                                                        |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=118.64)  | There's also CSS keeps these functions live and will recompute on value changes and updates            |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=124.2)   | all the functions that are in there.                                                                   |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=126.0)   | So it's very cool.                                                                                     |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=127.0)   | This again, a good indicator that they're dynamic.                                                     |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=129.7)   | And finally, just because this is just fun to say many of these CSS functions are pure                 |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=134.4)   | functions.                                                                                             |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=135.4)   | So that means that given the same parameters, they will always return the same value.                  |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=138.36)  | I know that sounds like how every function should work, but no, sometimes functions modify             |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=142.84)  | things outside of themselves and that which point they're not pure.                                    |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=145.5)   | So there are a couple of exceptions in CSS, I think counters is one counters, you totally              |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=150.52)  | change things outside yourself, but it's okay.                                                         |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=153.24)  | So anyway, hopefully that was a good breakdown of like, what is a function?                            |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=156.3)   | Why do I use them in CSS?                                                                              |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=158.04)  | And then let's dive into the rest.                                                                     |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=159.84)  | You know, what do you have for us and like types of functions available?                               |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=162.74)  | There's a lot of different types of functions available and all of these, you know, essentially        |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=166.04)  | just return values or go through some logic and give you some output.                                  |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=170.3)   | So the first type are functional selectors.                                                            |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=173.26)  | This would be on the left side of that property value statement.                                       |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=176.28)  | I would include pseudo classes that accept input values like is not and laying and we                  |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=181.78)  | need something to match with is like is is something that matches things.                              |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=187.2)   | So you need to have some kind of arguments for those matches or, or for laying, you have               |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=190.94)  | to have some language there.                                                                           |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=192.58)  | And also I want to note that we did an episode each on pseudo classes and pseudo elements.             |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=198.68)  | So check out the show for pseudo elements and pseudo classes if you want a deep dive                   |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=203.36)  | on these things, including some of the non-functional selectors here.                                  |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=206.74)  | It's a pretty robust look into pseudo CSS.                                                             |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=208.86)  | I will say I definitely had a lot of fun playing that show together.                                   |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=211.42)  | The next type is color function notation.                                                              |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=213.78)  | Color function notation uses comma separate values due to legacy functional notation,                  |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=218.74)  | but a newer browsers you can actually omit these commas, which is fun.                                 |
| [03:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=222.12)  | But if you do, you have to be careful and remember to browser test Adam.                               |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=225.86)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=226.86)  | I just broke a production by deploying comma list colors.                                              |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=231.1)   | So it was cool.                                                                                        |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=232.1)   | We opened it up in edge and it was a, it was a hew list site.                                          |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=234.78)  | It was like this site is lacking color.                                                                |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=236.54)  | And we're like, Oh, cause every single color defined is in a way that it doesn't understand.           |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=240.82)  | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=241.82)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=242.82)  | There are also gradient functions in gradient functions.                                               |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=244.26)  | You'll also see comma separating values and these are to denote distinct colors and their              |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=248.3)   | stops and different aspects of those functions.                                                        |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=251.02)  | All these functions have different arguments, argument lists.                                          |
| [04:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=253.1)   | We'll go over those.                                                                                   |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=254.1)   | I'm a mathematical expressions like Adam talked out with calc, you add, subtract, multiply,            |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=258.86)  | divide, and also accept parentheses within them.                                                       |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=263.46)  | So if you are doing mathematical notation, you can use PEMDAS the correct order of operations          |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=269.58)  | there.                                                                                                 |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=270.58)  | And this, as I said, will interpolate values.                                                          |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=272.56)  | Then within mathematical expressions, you have min max clamp image set, a min max.                     |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=277.76)  | These allow for logical comparisons and they can be used either in sizing or within grid               |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=283.1)   | for comparison.                                                                                        |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=284.5)   | There's also cubic Bezier functions, which are mathematic like, but these are used for                 |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=288.54)  | animations.                                                                                            |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=289.54)  | They create a curve from which to animate.                                                             |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=291.18)  | And then speaking of animations, there are steps and there's path functions, and these                 |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=295.42)  | are used within key frames or animation declarations to write animations that need arguments, need     |
| [05:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=302.54)  | some sort of parameters.                                                                               |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=304.34)  | But most functions accept one value, even though there are so many different types of                  |
| [05:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=308.7)   | functions used all over CSS.                                                                           |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=310.9)   | So we're going to get into how those notations vary and dive into the details of all of these          |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=315.32)  | various CSS functions.                                                                                 |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=317.46)  | So Adam, do you want to start with maybe like colors, functional color notation?                       |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=322.18)  | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                            |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=323.2)   | So we covered these in episode six and seven, and that was about color usage and color perception.     |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=328.62)  | So in case you want to get a super deep dive, go back and I loved those episodes too.                  |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=332.5)   | Their colors just amazing.                                                                             |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=333.9)   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=334.9)   | Anyway, so some of the color functions that we have available in CSS, we have HSL, HSLA,               |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=339.58)  | RGB, RGBA.                                                                                             |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=341.26)  | So those should feel very familiar.                                                                    |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=342.82)  | Those are functions again, right?                                                                      |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=343.9)   | They have a parentheses and they take multiple color channels that equate out and return               |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=348.38)  | a color value that can be painted.                                                                     |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=350.42)  | So kind of cool.                                                                                       |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=351.44)  | Those are also functions and that you can kind of pass custom properties in there and                  |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=354.5)   | do something dynamic.                                                                                  |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=355.9)   | Really fun.                                                                                            |
| [05:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=356.9)   | We also have lab and LCH.                                                                              |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=358.92)  | So these are new color notations for additional color gamuts that are coming out.                      |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=363.18)  | And then we have the color function itself.                                                            |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=365.74)  | Can't forget the color function.                                                                       |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=367.54)  | So this one is not really supported anywhere.                                                          |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=369.38)  | It's honestly like the most exciting one, I think too.                                                 |
| [06:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=371.98)  | But this is where you can pass in a gamut that you want and then the channels for that                 |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=376.08)  | value and then you can specify a bunch of fallbacks.                                                   |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=378.4)   | So in one color value definition that I write, I can actually match maybe four plus colors             |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=384.8)   | across different browsers and different capabilities.                                                  |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=387.34)  | So again, that color function indicates that there's a very dynamic color that is intended             |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=391.7)   | to be used here.                                                                                       |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=393.26)  | And yeah, so that's a little high level view of functional color notation.                             |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=396.9)   | I love that.                                                                                           |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=397.9)   | You're going to tell us about gradients, right?                                                        |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=399.74)  | Yeah, gradients use colors.                                                                            |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=402.46)  | So we're actually going to be diving more into gradients in our next episode, which                    |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=405.98)  | is episode 21.                                                                                         |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=407.66)  | So if you're interested in this topic, make sure to tune into that show for a much deeper              |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=412.38)  | dive into gradient functions.                                                                          |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=413.82)  | But these are some of my favorite things to play with in CSS.                                          |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=416.82)  | I think that there's a lot that you can do with gradients.                                             |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=419.66)  | And gradients are considered images and consist of a comma separated list of definitions.              |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=424.7)   | You can have multiple colors, multiple color stops, you could just angle and starting points           |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=428.5)   | of all these gradients.                                                                                |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=430.1)   | And there's three main types.                                                                          |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=431.22)  | You have linear gradients, radial gradients, and conic gradients.                                      |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=436.26)  | So with linear gradients, you need to define at least two colors for the gradient to show              |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=439.96)  | up.                                                                                                    |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=440.96)  | And the default is that the direction is top to bottom.                                                |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=442.96)  | So if you just write linear gradient red comma blue, it's going to be a top to bottom red              |
| [07:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=447.66)  | to blue gradient.                                                                                      |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=449.62)  | And as I mentioned briefly, you can also set color stop values.                                        |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=452.54)  | So you can have these positioned, you can have 100 colors within your gradient and have                |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=456.98)  | them all positioned at different intervals.                                                            |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=458.78)  | So you can have a lot of variants in there.                                                            |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=461.42)  | And if you don't want to go from top to bottom, you can set a direction as an angle like 45            |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=465.62)  | degrees or to right to left, and then create your gradient that way.                                   |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=471.22)  | There's also repeating gradient.                                                                       |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=472.82)  | So if you have a repeating linear gradient, you can set that instead of just linear gradient           |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=478.1)   | as the function.                                                                                       |
| [08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=479.56)  | And that is going to allow you to define a defined gradient pattern and its size and                   |
| [08:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=485.18)  | then make a repeating pattern to fill the rest of the element based on that template                   |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=489.74)  | pattern.                                                                                               |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=490.9)   | So these are really handy for making like stripes or other gradient effects.                           |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=495.02)  | And there's radial gradient.                                                                           |
| [08:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=496.44)  | So this is a rounded gradient as the background image.                                                 |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=500.08)  | And again, you have to define at least two colors for this to show up.                                 |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=502.82)  | And the default is from the center out to the edges.                                                   |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=505.44)  | And this radial gradient will take the proportions of its parent element.                              |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=508.34)  | If you have like a really wide rectangle, you're going to see this wide oval shaped                    |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=512.5)   | gradient by default.                                                                                   |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=514.26)  | But you can actually change the size and shape of that rounded piece by giving it a size               |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=519.2)   | or say circle.                                                                                         |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=520.2)   | Circle is a keyword you can use here for a perfectly round gradient.                                   |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=523.62)  | And then you can set the position.                                                                     |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=524.98)  | So you could use percentages or pixel values to place that circle or that rounded radial               |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=530.34)  | shape wherever you want within the elements.                                                           |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=532.74)  | And there's also keywords here you can use like for this left corner at top.                           |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=536.52)  | And then you would have like a radial gradient.                                                        |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=538.7)   | So like radial gradient circle at top center, red comma blue would be a radial gradient                |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=543.46)  | that has a circle as the inside part.                                                                  |
| [09:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=546.78)  | It starts at the top center of the div and goes from red in the center out to blue at                  |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=551.74)  | the edges.                                                                                             |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=552.74)  | So again, you can repeat these kind of like with linear gradients, a repeating radial                  |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=557.1)   | gradient kind of looks like a bullseye or some kind of like cool like effect from the                  |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=561.02)  | center.                                                                                                |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=562.14)  | And then finally, there's conic gradients.                                                             |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=563.7)   | So you can kind of think of conic gradients like a squeegee, where you have a squeegee                 |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=569.42)  | thing or like straight mop type thing and you fix one point and then you rotate the                    |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=575.74)  | squeegee around that point until it forms a circle.                                                    |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=579.3)   | So now take this circle of color and extend it out to the entire div or element and give               |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=585.42)  | the first and last color that you started and ended with a gradient transition in between.             |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=590.82)  | So conic gradients will start and end with either different colors, you're going to                    |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=594.9)   | see like a line that breaks the color or if they start and end with the same color, it                 |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=598.82)  | looks like a continuous cone of color there.                                                           |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=602.62)  | These are supported in all modern browsers except for Firefox and enable some interesting              |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=607.1)   | things like pie charts and we'll get into all that in our next episode.                                |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=610.58)  | But like radial and linear gradients, you can set the gradient start points and their                  |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=615.14)  | position or center coordinates.                                                                        |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=617.38)  | But unlike the other types of gradients, you need to use a unit that is like degrees or                |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=622.26)  | radians or turns where it sets the gradient position based on a percentage degree or rounded           |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=628.94)  | thing, a conic value, I don't know what to call it.                                                    |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=632.3)   | But you can also repeat these with repeating conic gradient.                                           |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=635.06)  | They look really cool, kind of like sunbursts.                                                         |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=637.14)  | You can sort of think of that instead of a stripe, like a linear gradient.                             |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=640.76)  | How about that for a teaser of the gradient episode that's next?                                       |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=644.38)  | That's gradients in three minutes.                                                                     |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=646.74)  | There's so much in there.                                                                              |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=647.74)  | It's really exciting stuff and you just casually dropped repeating conic gradient and I'm like,        |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=652.54)  | that is amazing.                                                                                       |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=653.54)  | It's so cool.                                                                                          |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=654.54)  | All right, well, let's talk about some functions that you can call that gets you some values           |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=658.66)  | and they get you runtime dynamic values.                                                               |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=661.5)   | We have the attribute function.                                                                        |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=663.3)   | So this is ATTR and this returns the value of an attribute on the selected element.                    |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=667.68)  | So this is a really neat one if you have just a custom attribute on an HTML node or even               |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=672.4)   | just its regular, you know, like you could say the input type.                                         |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=675.6)   | You can get that string, that value that's in that type parameter on the DOM node itself               |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=679.98)  | can come into CSS and become a value in a way.                                                         |
| [11:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=682.38)  | So attribute is this dynamic way to reach into the selected element and grab values                    |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=687.64)  | off of its attributes and use them in your CSS.                                                        |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=690.58)  | It's very cool.                                                                                        |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=691.58)  | It's a little limited at the moment, but soon it's going to get some mighty improvements.              |
| [11:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=696.1)   | So be on the lookout for an article and blog post about what is coming to the attribute                |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=700.2)   | function in CSS.                                                                                       |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=701.52)  | It is super exciting.                                                                                  |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=702.9)   | Anyway, we also have the variable keyword in CSS.                                                      |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=705.9)   | So you probably have used this.                                                                        |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=707.38)  | This is how you use a custom property that's been created.                                             |
| [11:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=710.66)  | So you say var open parentheses and you could specify the name of the custom property in               |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=715.14)  | there and you can also put a comma and specify a fallback.                                             |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=718.86)  | So when you define a custom property, you don't use a function, but when you want to                   |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=722.14)  | use it, you do use the functional notation again, because you're reaching in, you're                   |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=725.9)   | grabbing something dynamic and contextual.                                                             |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=728.38)  | Kind of cool.                                                                                          |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=729.38)  | We also have the URL function.                                                                         |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=730.88)  | So you've used this all the time and you also use this in different locations.                         |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=734.34)  | And the URL function is for fetching assets.                                                           |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=737.24)  | You can use this for grabbing font files or images.                                                    |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=739.54)  | You can specify base 64 strings.                                                                       |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=741.58)  | You can even specify IDs to like items on the page.                                                    |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=745.02)  | So this could be for SVG.                                                                              |
| [12:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=746.58)  | There's also at import URL and at namespace URL.                                                       |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=749.76)  | So URL can get used in a few different ways.                                                           |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=752.06)  | It's just like a small side note.                                                                      |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=753.26)  | I was reading the spec on URL and it looks like CSS level one, the URL functional notation             |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=757.72)  | described true URLs, whatever that means.                                                              |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=760.54)  | And then it's CSS level two, they expanded it so that URL could be used to describe an                 |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=764.7)   | URI and a URN, whatever a URN is.                                                                      |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=768.14)  | What is a URN?                                                                                         |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=769.14)  | I have no idea.                                                                                        |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=770.16)  | But eventually they came back and in CSS level three with the URL function, they were like,            |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=774.18)  | nah, let's just go back to the original.                                                               |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=775.86)  | And they just cropped it back.                                                                         |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=776.98)  | So it's now again, true URLs.                                                                          |
| [12:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=778.9)   | So the URL function can only take URLs.                                                                |
| [13:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=782.3)   | I suppose that makes sense.                                                                            |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=783.54)  | The last function for values is image set.                                                             |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=786.52)  | And this lets you in CSS specify a fallback set of responsive images and each of them                  |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=791.22)  | take a URL to the image asset itself and then a resolution that you have to specify so that            |
| [13:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=796.3)   | it can be matched.                                                                                     |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=797.3)   | And once that resolution matches, it will grab that image from the set and use it in                   |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=800.22)  | your CSS.                                                                                              |
| [13:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=801.22)  | Again, something runtime and dynamic it needed to do.                                                  |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=804.02)  | So yeah, those are cool.                                                                               |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=806.04)  | So I did also mention pseudo selector functions and pseudo selectors like focus, hover, hash           |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=812.54)  | child, end child, all those sorts of things, some of these need to accept arguments to                 |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=817.06)  | do their job.                                                                                          |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=818.5)   | So there are 61 stable and experimental pseudo selectors in total.                                     |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=822.84)  | So if you are interested in hearing about almost all of those in our other episodes,                   |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=827.34)  | again, check those out in the podcast.                                                                 |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=830.22)  | Thank you for listening to us.                                                                         |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=832.18)  | But the functional pseudo selectors are NOT, IS, WHERE, LANG, and DUR.                                 |
| [13:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=838.88)  | So if we start with NOT, NOT is a negation factor.                                                     |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=842.26)  | It accepts one selector and the ability to include more than one is currently experimental             |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=847.66)  | not widely supported.                                                                                  |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=849.24)  | So right now, you're just going to be able to use NOT with one value in there and you                  |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=854.04)  | also can't nest them.                                                                                  |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=855.18)  | You can't have colon NOT colon NOT.                                                                    |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=857.78)  | That's not going to work.                                                                              |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=859.04)  | So if you're going to use NOT, you could write, for example, a colon NOT and then in parentheses       |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=864.0)   | dot blue.                                                                                              |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=865.0)   | And this would target all links that did not have a class of blue on them.                             |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=868.1)   | So this is really helpful where you have general style rules and then a few exceptions here            |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=872.78)  | and there.                                                                                             |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=873.78)  | I've used NOT pretty selectively, not very often, but it can really come in handy in                   |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=878.14)  | those occasional moments.                                                                              |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=880.18)  | There's also IS and WHERE and these are matches selectors.                                             |
| [14:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=883.82)  | In fact, matches was renamed to IS and these look for matches to the arguments that go                 |
| [14:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=888.46)  | into the selector functions.                                                                           |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=890.06)  | So colon IS can be used for a shortcut for writing code.                                               |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=893.9)   | So you can write colon IS and then in parentheses header comma main comma footer a colon hover         |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=899.82)  | and then write your styling in there.                                                                  |
| [15:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=901.46)  | This is equivalent to writing header a colon hover comma main a colon hover comma and footer           |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=907.3)   | a colon hover.                                                                                         |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=908.9)   | So you're styling the links on hover only in the header, main and footer sections.                     |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=914.22)  | This is kind of similar to the concept of ampersands in Sass where you can just write                  |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=919.04)  | a little bit more concisely your code.                                                                 |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=921.66)  | You can also use this to do things like a colon IS and then in the argument list colon                 |
| [15:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=926.94)  | hover comma colon focus and style both the hover and focus state of a link in one line                 |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=932.14)  | of code.                                                                                               |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=933.14)  | So you can just write it directly as you're writing that selector instead of having to                 |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=937.14)  | write these all with commas and like enters and anyway.                                                |
| [15:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=940.22)  | It's really nice for simplifying longer complex selectors like specifically.                           |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=944.14)  | And the difference between WHERE and IS is that WHERE always has zero specificity but                  |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=950.66)  | IS takes on the specificity of the most specific selectors that you put in the argument list.          |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=955.86)  | So it's always going to be more specific than the specificity of the selectors in that list            |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=959.66)  | but WHERE is easier to override with simple selectors.                                                 |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=962.82)  | So it's all about specificity baby.                                                                    |

| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=970.5)   | I've just started like singing opera songs.                                                            |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=972.42)  | Well wait, you were trying to do, what's the song?                                                     |
| [16:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=974.54)  | It's like it's not the Benjamins.                                                                      |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=975.78)  | It's all about the specificity baby.                                                                   |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=977.5)   | I'm like trying to think what rap song were you?                                                       |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=979.34)  | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=980.34)  | No, I'm canceling myself.                                                                              |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=984.62)  | I loved it.                                                                                            |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=985.62)  | Weirdness is awesome.                                                                                  |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=986.62)  | Anyway.                                                                                                |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=987.62)  | The last two pseudo selector functions are LANG and DUR.                                               |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=992.9)   | LANG accepts a language shorthand such as FR for French or EN for English and DUR which                |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=998.66)  | means direction.                                                                                       |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1000.02) | Also it accepts RTL or LTR so you can style specifically based on these properties based               |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1006.74) | on language.                                                                                           |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1007.74) | It only accepts those two values so if you put something else in there it's just not                   |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1010.34) | going to read it.                                                                                      |
| [16:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1011.34) | It's going to ignore the line.                                                                         |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1012.86) | And then we also have these pseudo class nth pattern selectors.                                        |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1017.28) | So these you would have an nth pattern.                                                                |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1019.62) | I actually really want to do a show on these because I think that this is like a really                |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1023.34) | interesting robust micro syntax and that syntax is the argument for the function.                      |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1030.38) | So if you're using an nth pattern of 2n for the nth child function for that as the pseudo              |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1037.1)  | selector function the selection would then start from the top of the list and target                   |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1041.74) | every other item skipping the first item to start with that second one.                                |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1045.78) | So it would be like second, fourth, sixth, etc.                                                        |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1049.28) | And the last child would start from the end not the beginning but it would essentially                 |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1053.66) | do the same thing so it would target every other value starting at the second to last                  |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1057.94) | one.                                                                                                   |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1058.94) | So it would depend on how many are in the list for this.                                               |
| [17:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1060.94) | Then there's also nth of type which allows you to specify based on a specific type of                  |
| [17:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1066.06) | element on top of that regular pattern.                                                                |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1069.1)  | So you would be selecting like only paragraphs that are every other paragraph which is super           |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1074.3)  | useful for like ads and things if you have those interjected between paragraphs anyway.                |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1078.38) | And then last nth last of type would run the same pattern as nth last child but again starting         |
| [18:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1083.78) | from the end and using that type the types.                                                            |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1087.02) | We got types.                                                                                          |
| [18:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1088.42) | We got types.                                                                                          |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1089.42) | CSS has types and functions.                                                                           |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1091.0)  | It's a real programming language everybody.                                                            |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1095.06) | That's like I made that tweet the other day about I was like CSS is a functional programming           |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1099.98) | language and people are like it looks like Haskell.                                                    |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1102.26) | I'm like I know that's kind of the point here is it's totally select where from you know               |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1106.22) | and map some new properties on it.                                                                     |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1108.58) | Anyway CSS is a programming language.                                                                  |

| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1111.12) | Anyway whatever this little opinionation piece coming out right there.                                 |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1114.3)  | Oops my bad.                                                                                           |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1115.3)  | Listen I've been fighting this since my career began so the conversation's the same.                   |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1122.9)  | Stupid battle that anyway whatever.                                                                    |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1124.14) | Okay so we have math functions.                                                                        |
| [18:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1126.26) | Let's talk about math and CSS again because it's not a programming language.                           |
| [18:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1130.14) | It needs math.                                                                                         |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1131.14) | Okay I'm done with that joke.                                                                          |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1132.14) | Anyway we have math functions.                                                                         |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1133.22) | We talked about calc already.                                                                          |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1134.94) | Calc is super powerful.                                                                                |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1136.2)  | We also got some new ones of min, max, and clamp.                                                      |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1139.82) | I don't think we've done a show on those but we did cover them in one episode.                         |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1143.46) | Do you remember which one it was?                                                                      |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1144.66) | We talked about them in layout or spacing.                                                             |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1149.46) | Probably both of those shows.                                                                          |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1151.18) | Probably both.                                                                                         |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1152.18) | Yeah it comes in really handy.                                                                         |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1153.38) | I feel like we should do a deeper dive on them because they're really powerful.                        |
| [19:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1157.38) | So min, max, and clamp can take multiple values comma separated and again a runtime determination      |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1163.28) | will be made about which value to use based on what came back dynamically.                             |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1167.56) | So it's really fun to put inside of min, max, and clamp a viewport unit.                               |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1171.46) | Right so you can say like hey I want my font size to be I don't know 1.1 rem but maybe                 |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1176.62) | try being three viewport unit wide.                                                                    |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1179.42) | And then on a really big screen you can say min or max and essentially clamp that to say               |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1183.3)  | be a fluid number that's based on the viewport or max yourself out at this font size here.             |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1189.66) | So it's really really powerful cool logic that you can tuck right in between those parentheses         |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1194.1)  | there.                                                                                                 |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1195.1)  | We also have like legit math functions in CSS.                                                         |
| [19:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1198.02) | You can do sine, cosine, tan, pow like all those really fun ones to do your dynamic animations         |
| [20:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1204.14) | so you can put these inside of calc.                                                                   |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1205.74) | It's really cool powerful stuff.                                                                       |
| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1206.96) | So CSS has numerous math functions for you to use.                                                     |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1210.3)  | Yeah and speaking of animations I feel like I'm on like the episode teaser patrol here                 |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1215.42) | because again I want to note that we're gonna have some upcoming episodes on this.                     |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1221.7)  | The teaser patrol would be the coolest team to be on.                                                  |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1223.9)  | It's like what team are you on?                                                                        |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1224.9)  | I'm on the teaser patrol.                                                                              |
| [20:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1225.9)  | We're gonna highlight a lot of really cool animation things but in this episode we're                  |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1231.66) | gonna talk about the two functions of cubic bezier and steps.                                          |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1235.42) | Cubic Bezier is used in animations to specify easing curves.                                           |
| [20:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1240.48) | So you would have easing curves as like shorthands for how you want your animation to move throughout  |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1248.04) | the space.                                                                                             |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1249.14) | So the shorthands are like ease in, ease out, ease in at, or linear.                                   |
| [20:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1252.62) | But if you want to create your own cubic bezier accepts four comma separated values and you            |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1257.58) | can think of these as two different handles on either end of this curve.                               |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1263.18) | So the first handle is at 0, 0 and the second handle is at 1, 1 and then the values inside             |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1268.34) | of the cubic bezier argument list are going to be the x-y coordinates of that first handle             |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1274.78) | and the second handle.                                                                                 |
| [21:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1276.18) | So it's going to be the first two of the first handle.                                                 |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1278.1)  | The second two are the last handle.                                                                    |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1280.98) | So a linear ease would be cubic bezier 0, 0, 1, 1.                                                     |
| [21:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1285.34) | It would just look like a straight diagonal line.                                                      |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1287.54) | But if you wanted to pull this handle upward to look like the left half of a rainbow, then             |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1293.86) | you would change it to 0, 1, 1, 1.                                                                     |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1296.9)  | So that would move that first one upward.                                                              |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1299.42) | And if you wanted it to look like the opposite of that, which would be like the right half             |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1304.12) | of a U, that would sort of be like an ease in, then you would have it at 1, 0, 1, 1.                   |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1310.76) | So we're only just seeing that x value of the right handle, not the y value of it.                     |
| [21:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1314.46) | The possibilities here are endless, anything between 0 and 1, even negative numbers works              |
| [22:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1319.7)  | here so I encourage you to try these out.                                                              |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1322.5)  | There's a really great site called cubicbezier.com.                                                    |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1325.42) | It's cubic-bezier.com.                                                                                 |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1326.42) | It's B-E-Z-I-E-R if you're wondering how it's spelled.                                                 |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1332.06) | And this site makes it really easy to play around with these and see how they affect                   |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1335.28) | your animation, even play an animation with a duration.                                                |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1339.08) | So love that site, we'll link it.                                                                      |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1341.0)  | Also steps, steps are used with step animation.                                                        |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1343.34) | Step animations are like a ticking clock animation or something that stops at different points.        |
| [22:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1347.7)  | So the steps function accepts the number of steps as the first argument and then the direction.        |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1351.92) | So you can either go start to end, which is to identify which direction through the animation          |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1356.94) | loop these steps go.                                                                                   |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1358.16) | So front to back, back to start.                                                                       |
| [22:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1359.9)  | The default is end, so you're going from start to end.                                                 |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1362.78) | Awesome.                                                                                               |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1363.78) | For some reason, cubicbezier, I loved the word bezier and I went through this thought                  |
| [22:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1366.8)  | process of that would be a great pet name.                                                             |
| [22:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1369.12) | And then I was like, wait a second, maybe it's a nerd cafe that's called-                              |
| [22:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1372.7)  | Bezier Cafe.                                                                                           |

| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1375.7)  | I would eat there.                                                                                     |

| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1382.7)  | Love it.                                                                                               |
| [23:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1383.7)  | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [23:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1384.7)  | So let's talk about how you can make shapes.                                                           |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1387.16) | So there's like functions in CSS for creating shapes and these are used inside of shape                |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1390.82) | outside and clip path.                                                                                 |
| [23:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1392.62) | And you have functions like, well, path and path is a function that can take all sorts                 |
| [23:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1397.72) | of other parameters, but it's used for animation or inside a clip path.                                |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1400.58) | You also have offset path.                                                                             |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1402.42) | We have circle, which can make circles.                                                                |
| [23:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1404.62) | We have ellipse, which doesn't make circles, it makes ellipses.                                        |
| [23:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1407.5)  | Hey, here's a fun little note.                                                                         |
| [23:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1408.9)  | I learned this in a kid's book and I feel smarter now because of it for some reason,                   |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1413.0)  | but did you know a circle is not an ellipse, which is not an oval?                                     |
| [23:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1415.98) | No, I didn't know that.                                                                                |
| [23:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1417.28) | I'm confused.                                                                                          |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1418.28) | Can you explain this again?                                                                            |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1419.28) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [23:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1420.28) | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1421.28) | So like an egg is an oval and an egg is not an ellipse.                                                |
| [23:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1424.46) | So like an ellipse, I think the final determination was that two sides are parallel.                   |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1429.5)  | So a circle is like all sides are parallel or whatever and ellipses, two sides are parallel            |
| [23:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1434.1)  | and an oval is only one side is parallel.                                                              |
| [23:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1437.12) | So like an egg is like, right?                                                                         |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1439.54) | It only shares, anyway, whatever.                                                                      |
| [24:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1441.86) | I always thought it was the opposite where like an egg would be an ellipse, but on an                  |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1445.98) | oval, but I'm wrong.                                                                                   |
| [24:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1447.32) | I don't know how to English.                                                                           |
| [24:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1448.7)  | I remember I felt really wrong too.                                                                    |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1450.66) | Here's the assertion.                                                                                  |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1451.66) | This is what we could just walk away with, which is an ellipse is an oval, but an oval                 |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1455.06) | may not be an ellipse.                                                                                 |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1456.06) | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1457.06) | So it's like a square and a rectangle.                                                                 |
| [24:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1458.06) | A square is a rectangle, but a rectangle may not be a square.                                          |
| [24:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1460.82) | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| [24:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1461.82) | And so, yeah, that's why we have two different functions in here.                                      |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1463.22) | We have circle and we have ellipse.                                                                    |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1465.02) | So just kind of funny, weird kids books are teaching me things every day.                              |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1470.82) | We also have the polygon function.                                                                     |
| [24:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1472.26) | So this is anytime you want to draw a shape that has three or more vertices.                           |
| [24:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1475.46) | So this can create cool things like triangles and other stuff.                                         |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1478.26) | And then we have the inset function, which is for creating rectangular shapes.                         |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1481.72) | And don't be confused with the inset function versus the inset property, because we talked             |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1485.74) | about in the logical property episode about the inset, which is pretty much your logical               |
| [24:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1490.34) | version of top left, bottom right, the physical ones.                                                  |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1493.16) | And the inset here is a function and it's for creating squares.                                        |
| [24:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1497.18) | So anyway, kind of interesting.                                                                        |
| [24:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1499.14) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1500.14) | Next we have sizing functions, which are also known as transform functions because these               |
| [25:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1504.96) | go on the right hand side of the transform property.                                                   |
| [25:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1509.14) | The transform property is super robust and just like a really interesting world of its                 |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1512.9)  | own.                                                                                                   |
| [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1513.9)  | But let's start by talking about scale.                                                                |
| [25:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1515.66) | So you have these scaleX, scaleY and scaleZ functions.                                                 |
| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1519.26) | These increase or decrease the size of something along an axis, whether it's the X axis, which         |
| [25:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1524.5)  | is horizontal, the Y axis, which is vertical, or the Z axis, which is away from and towards            |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1530.18) | you, like Z index.                                                                                     |
| [25:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1531.94) | So these would specify where you're scaling from and they accept unitless values.                      |
| [25:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1536.64) | So that would be like one is the default, anything less than one would decrease the                    |
| [25:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1539.9)  | scale, greater than one would increase the scale.                                                      |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1541.78) | And it goes quickly when you increase the scale.                                                       |
| [25:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1544.4)  | So then there's also a shorthand for all of these, which is just scale.                                |
| [25:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1548.08) | And this is a shorthand for a 2D plane transformation, which is just the X and Y axis.                 |
| [25:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1552.9)  | But there's also scale3D.                                                                              |
| [25:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1555.14) | So with scale, you could have either two values, like an X and Y transformation or one value,          |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1560.26) | which would be duplicated as both.                                                                     |
| [26:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1561.98) | But then for scale3D, you must have three values, the X, Y and Z values for your transformations.      |
| [26:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1567.86) | And you can do a lot of fun, like animated 3D transformations with this.                               |
| [26:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1571.66) | There is also the perspective function when you are working with 3D CSS.                               |
| [26:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1576.02) | And here you would set a perspective point.                                                            |
| [26:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1579.28) | So imagine like when you're creating a perspective based landscape drawing in art class in like        |
| [26:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1584.66) | fourth grade, you would have like your origin point and then you draw the lines towards                |
| [26:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1588.62) | it as your perspective.                                                                                |
| [26:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1590.1)  | So perspective takes one argument that's a set value like 10 rems.                                     |
| [26:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1594.38) | And you can use that in the same line of transformations as all the other transform functions, because |
| [26:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1600.18) | it all goes within the same property.                                                                  |
| [26:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1602.34) | So then we also have translate.                                                                        |
| [26:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1605.94) | Translate is similar to scale in terms of the way it's written.                                        |
| [26:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1609.38) | But instead of increasing or decreasing the size of something, it would be moving the                  |
| [26:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1613.82) | elements on a plane.                                                                                   |
| [26:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1615.66) | So there's translateX, which moves it on the X plane, translateY moves it on the Y                     |
| [26:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1619.34) | plane, translateZ to move on that Z plane away from towards you.                                       |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1623.94) | And then translate itself is a shorthand for X and Y, except one or two values.                        |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1629.26) | And there's translate3D, which accepts X, Y, and Z transformations all at the same time.               |
| [27:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1634.26) | These accept static values like pixels, ems, inches, any length value.                                 |
| [27:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1639.06) | We also have rotate.                                                                                   |
| [27:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1640.3)  | So there's rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ.                                                                  |
| [27:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1642.38) | These are rotations on an axis.                                                                        |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1644.22) | You can use degrees, radians, turns, all of those fun round units for this.                            |
| [27:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1650.02) | Rotate is the shorthand for X and Y.                                                                   |
| [27:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1651.74) | And rotate3D actually takes four arguments, the X and Y rotations, as well as an angle                 |
| [27:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1658.46) | that you're rotating at.                                                                               |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1659.66) | So there's rotate3D.                                                                                   |
| [27:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1660.86) | You could do rotate3D 1, 1, 1, 45 degrees, all comma separated.                                        |
| [27:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1665.92) | And this would be a positive angle rotation.                                                           |
| [27:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1668.34) | The positive angle would be a clockwise rotation, and the negative angle would be counterclockwise.    |
| [27:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1673.7)  | That's one way to think about that rotation angle.                                                     |
| [27:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1676.38) | And finally, there's skew.                                                                             |
| [27:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1677.9)  | So there's skewX, skewY, and just the skew shorthand for both X and Y.                                 |
| [28:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1683.46) | This takes two corners and slants them.                                                                |
| [28:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1685.9)  | So you could think of like a parallelogram, where you have like the top and bottom slanted             |
| [28:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1691.44) | vibe, and that is the shape that you're creating here, which is useful if you're creating              |
| [28:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1696.78) | like perspective in CSS.                                                                               |
| [28:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1698.74) | And this accepts values and turns, radians, all of those great radial degrees, factors,                |
| [28:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1705.18) | factors, units.                                                                                        |
| [28:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1706.64) | We have a units show too, since I'm the listen to our other shows police today.                        |
| [28:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1711.3)  | Kind of is like that, huh?                                                                             |
| [28:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1713.42) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [28:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1714.42) | There are so many episodes we've done at this point that cover like basic CSS, like things             |
| [28:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1720.58) | that are so involved in every other aspect of CSS, that it's hard not to reference those               |
| [28:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1725.84) | shows.                                                                                                 |
| [28:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1727.14) | And I think they're pretty good too.                                                                   |
| [28:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1728.7)  | So yeah.                                                                                               |
| [28:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1729.7)  | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [28:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1730.7)  | Nice and bite size.                                                                                    |
| [28:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1731.7)  | I agree.                                                                                               |
| [28:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1732.7)  | And I'm looking forward to more and more this ability to reference those.                              |
| [28:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1735.48) | It's kind of fun.                                                                                      |
| [28:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1736.48) | Hey, we have a catalog unit.                                                                           |
| [28:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1737.98) | We have a catalog.                                                                                     |
| [29:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1739.54) | We have a catalog.                                                                                     |
| [29:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1740.54) | All right, sorry, everyone.                                                                            |
| [29:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1742.06) | That's in the middle of the episode.                                                                   |
| [29:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1743.18) | We're just patting our own backs.                                                                      |
| [29:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1744.5)  | It's okay.                                                                                             |
| [29:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1746.78) | We've got other functions.                                                                             |
| [29:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1748.18) | There's like tons more functions to go over here.                                                      |
| [29:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1750.1)  | This is going to be a long show.                                                                       |
| [29:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1751.1)  | This is a long show.                                                                                   |
| [29:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1752.1)  | No, we're almost done.                                                                                 |
| [29:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1753.1)  | I swear.                                                                                               |
| [29:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1754.1)  | We are on the final stretch.                                                                           |
| [29:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1756.02) | At this point, if I was on a run, I might start sprinting.                                             |
| [29:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1758.78) | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| [29:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1759.78) | So we've also got filters.                                                                             |
| [29:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1761.1)  | These filter functions you've definitely, you've used a blur before.                                   |
| [29:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1764.1)  | I know you have.                                                                                       |
| [29:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1765.1)  | I use it all the time.                                                                                 |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1766.34) | I like blurring stuff.                                                                                 |
| [29:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1767.34) | I think it creates kind of a cool effect.                                                              |
| [29:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1768.78) | Anyway, so we have many filters that are functions and they are runtime contextual and they do         |
| [29:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1774.06) | lots of really cool stuff.                                                                             |
| [29:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1775.06) | So we have blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, hue, rotate, invert, opacity, saturate, sepia,       |
| [29:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1783.98) | drop shadow, and URL.                                                                                  |
| [29:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1786.16) | So URL is not a filter, but you can pass in a filter into that URL.                                    |
| [29:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1788.74) | It's just kind of cool.                                                                                |
| [29:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1789.74) | I wanted to throw that in there as a side note.                                                        |
| [29:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1791.14) | I feel like we should do a whole episode on filters at some point and really dive deep                 |
| [29:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1795.78) | into like how some of these work and how you can leverage them, but for now it seems kind              |
| [30:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1799.92) | of okay just to list them there high level.                                                            |

| [30:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1802.78) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [30:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1803.78) | I mean, I love using filters and blend modes and now with edge using a basis of chromium,              |
| [30:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1811.68) | these are something you can really implement in your designs today.                                    |
| [30:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1815.72) | You don't have to use a separate image for hover effects.                                              |
| [30:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1818.66) | You can use these for so many different visual effects and interactive effects.                        |
| [30:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1822.9)  | So I'm like a huge, huge fan of filters and blend modes in CSS.                                        |
| [30:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1826.42) | Totally.                                                                                               |
| [30:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1827.42) | We're junkies.                                                                                         |
| [30:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1828.42) | We're like color junkies.                                                                              |
| [30:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1829.42) | We're filter junkies.                                                                                  |
| [30:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1830.42) | It's okay.                                                                                             |
| [30:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1831.42) | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| [30:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1832.42) | And we're also grid junkies.                                                                           |
| [30:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1833.42) | We are grid junkies.                                                                                   |
| [30:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1834.42) | There are a few different grid functions that are super helpful.                                       |
| [30:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1837.74) | The first one is fit content.                                                                          |
| [30:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1839.36) | This is used for sizing items.                                                                         |
| [30:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1841.62) | It accepts one argument, but the function itself is a shorthand for a pretty interesting               |
| [30:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1847.58) | calculation and that calculation is min and in parentheses maximum size and then the max               |
| [30:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1854.58) | function taking the minimum size and the argument that you're putting into fit content.                |
| [31:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1859.98) | So what does that mean?                                                                                |
| [31:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1862.06) | Let's say an example.                                                                                  |
| [31:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1863.24) | So you would use fit content when you're defining grid template columns or grid template rows          |
| [31:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1867.74) | and say you have like fit content.                                                                     |
| [31:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1869.94) | You have grid template columns, fit content 400px, fit content 400px auto.                             |
| [31:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1876.18) | So this would be three columns.                                                                        |
| [31:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1877.42) | The first two have a fit content of 400px.                                                             |
| [31:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1879.62) | This is just one example of how you would use it.                                                      |
| [31:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1881.62) | So the content in the first and second columns would be clamped at the 400px max size, but             |
| [31:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1887.34) | if the content within those is smaller than 400 pixels, it would take the auto size of                 |
| [31:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1892.3)  | the minimum content, so the min content size.                                                          |
| [31:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1895.2)  | So you can use absolute units here like pixels or rems or percentage based in the viewport             |
| [31:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1899.7)  | units.                                                                                                 |
| [31:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1900.7)  | There's also min max.                                                                                  |
| [31:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1902.22) | So min max accepts two values and this defines a size range in between the minimum and maximum         |
| [31:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1907.26) | values provided.                                                                                       |
| [31:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1908.62) | It's very similar to clamp, but you're using this for grid logic where the actual value                |
| [31:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1913.58) | in clamp is the min content size of what's inside the grid.                                            |
| [31:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1917.36) | So those are similar but not used outside of grid.                                                     |
| [32:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1920.58) | You got to use min max grid and you could put a variety of values in here.                             |
| [32:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1924.5)  | You could use absolute lengths like pixels.                                                            |
| [32:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1926.86) | You could use a percentage.                                                                            |
| [32:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1927.92) | You could use flex values, fractional units or keyword values like max content, min content            |
| [32:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1933.64) | or auto.                                                                                               |
| [32:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1934.64) | So an example would be min max 300px, 1fr.                                                             |
| [32:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1938.5)  | Those would be the two arguments in there.                                                             |
| [32:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1939.74) | So this would be a minimum of 300 pixels, a maximum of one fractional unit of that grid                |
| [32:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1943.5)  | space.                                                                                                 |
| [32:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1944.5)  | You could say something like min max 300px 50vw.                                                       |
| [32:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1947.48) | So instead of one fractional unit, the max would be 50% of the viewport width.                         |
| [32:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1952.18) | And then an example of like min max and the min content, 500px where min content would                 |
| [32:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1958.22) | be the smallest size of the content on your page which is inside of that grid column which             |
| [32:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1964.36) | is already sort of the default but the max there we find your px.                                      |
| [32:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1968.22) | Finally we have repeat as a grid function.                                                             |
| [32:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1970.64) | Repeat is a shorthand that helps you write grid templates a bit more concisely.                        |
| [32:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1974.54) | So for an equally spaced six column grid instead of writing something like grid template columns       |
| [33:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1979.64) | 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, you can write grid template columns and then repeat colon                |
| [33:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1987.16) | six comma 1fr.                                                                                         |
| [33:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1988.98) | That's it.                                                                                             |
| [33:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1989.98) | So nice.                                                                                               |
| [33:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1990.98) | What a convenience that they threw in there with the repeat function because now I'm thinking          |
| [33:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1994.08) | about it, it's like you have a grid template and yeah you could write a hundred template               |
| [33:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1998.14) | columns in there if you wanted to.                                                                     |
| [33:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=1999.82) | It is just so convenient yeah.                                                                         |
| [33:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2001.3)  | Or like grid auto columns which is essentially like grid repeat template but then we have              |
| [33:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2006.58) | this function repeat which is somewhere in the middle.                                                 |
| [33:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2009.62) | It's like I don't want to repeat my template pattern forever.                                          |
| [33:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2013.6)  | I also don't want to only do it anyway.                                                                |
| [33:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2016.38) | What a convenience.                                                                                    |
| [33:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2017.38) | They're so thoughtful the CSS working group.                                                           |
| [33:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2019.7)  | I can't believe it.                                                                                    |
| [33:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2020.7)  | You can even use repeat with like min max like write like repeat min max and then give                 |
| [33:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2026.06) | it like sizing inside of there.                                                                        |
| [33:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2028.22) | So rad.                                                                                                |
| [33:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2029.22) | So rad.                                                                                                |
| [33:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2030.22) | The final functions.                                                                                   |
| [33:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2031.28) | The final functions.                                                                                   |
| [33:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2032.54) | That was just fun to sing.                                                                             |
| [33:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2033.54) | It's the final functions.                                                                              |
| [33:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2038.62) | It's just media queries and supports.                                                                  |
| [34:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2041.34) | Anyway okay well I just breezed right through like I didn't try to sing on a podcast.                  |
| [34:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2044.98) | You know so we've got the at media media query and it's a function.                                    |
| [34:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2049.74) | It's a function and it has parameters.                                                                 |
| [34:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2051.94) | Well it has parentheses and you pass things inside of there and those are runtime contextual           |
| [34:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2055.38) | so you have like a media query for min width whatever right and that's something that needs            |
| [34:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2059.34) | to be checked dynamically against the visiting system and the viewport size that it has.               |
| [34:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2064.06) | We have color gamut p3 so you can say media query hey tell me dynamically at runtime does              |
| [34:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2069.2)  | this device support color gamut p3.                                                                    |
| [34:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2071.4)  | If it does I want to go into hyper color space and show some really neat stuff.                        |
| [34:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2075.34) | We also have at supports and at supports can take an expression where you test to see if               |
| [34:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2080.34) | something is supported or not.                                                                         |
| [34:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2081.5)  | So I have a fun at supports example here which is at supports open parentheses color colon             |
| [34:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2086.64) | color function display p3 and then I have a like a color function inside of the color                  |
| [34:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2092.38) | at supports anyway just kind of fun.                                                                   |
| [34:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2094.3)  | We have like functions inside of functions because that's how functional CSS is.                       |
| [34:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2098.3)  | It's very nimble that way.                                                                             |
| [35:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2100.04) | So that kind of covers like hey if you know of a CSS function that we did not just list                |
| [35:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2104.9)  | hit us up we want to know but before we end we want to talk about hacking functions and                |
| [35:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2109.94) | that functions since they are so dynamic and they do things that maybe are you know less               |
| [35:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2115.66) | predictable or you're giving the developer and the user some power to integrate with                   |
| [35:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2120.38) | the system.                                                                                            |
| [35:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2121.38) | This is a lot like when you take input from a form and you submit it into the database.                |
| [35:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2125.74) | Anytime the user is contributing something into your system which is supposed to be very               |
| [35:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2129.86) | private right your server is supposed to be this private space it can be hacked.                       |
| [35:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2133.58) | So since we can pass really really robust things into these functions they have to create              |
| [35:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2139.34) | spec entries and other things that prevent people from hacking and attacking your users                |
| [35:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2144.1)  | through CSS.                                                                                           |
| [35:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2145.1)  | Did you know that CSS can attack people?                                                               |
| [35:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2147.5)  | It can steal data.                                                                                     |
| [35:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2149.1)  | So anyway we're not going to go into that I think we should do like a CSS hacking episode              |
| [35:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2152.3)  | but I did want to talk today about the billion laughs attack and this is a custom property             |
| [35:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2158.22) | CSS attack and essentially what happens is inside of you make a CSS custom property and                |
| [36:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2164.3)  | you say its value is this and its default is this and you specify the default as the                   |
| [36:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2169.26) | previous custom property.                                                                              |
| [36:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2170.82) | So essentially what you're doing is you're creating a recursive custom property expansion              |
| [36:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2174.94) | scenario where every new custom property references the previous one which was already expanded        |
| [36:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2179.54) | to be bigger.                                                                                          |
| [36:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2180.66) | So eventually you get a custom property that is full of so many other custom properties                |
| [36:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2185.62) | that it takes down the browser and it's called a billion laughs because essentially you can            |
| [36:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2190.46) | create like a lol text string and just repeat it until it reaches a billion and I think                |
| [36:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2195.46) | this is an important one to talk about because I think you reach a billion laughs in like              |
| [36:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2200.14) | 30 or 40 custom properties.                                                                            |
| [36:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2202.18) | So essentially this is a hack that you can hand write it only takes you a minute or two                |
| [36:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2207.14) | to just sit down and hand write CSS custom properties that take the browser down and                   |
| [36:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2212.5)  | it's called the billion laughs attack.                                                                 |
| [36:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2213.86) | So the browser had to add a limit they had to add a limit it's in the spec and it says                 |
| [36:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2217.26) | hey a custom property needs to have a maximum and it's on you browser you can decide how               |
| [37:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2222.2)  | big of a string someone can put inside of a custom property and so anyway I encourage                  |
| [37:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2228.16) | you all to go look at what your browser is your favorite and what is their limit that                  |
| [37:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2232.34) | they have on what you can put inside of a custom property.                                             |
| [37:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2235.86) | So kind of interesting.                                                                                |
| [37:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2237.34) | There's also URL attacks and attribute based attacks so there's things where people can                |
| [37:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2242.74) | create a URL dynamically in CSS using the attribute function append those values onto                  |
| [37:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2247.34) | a URL and essentially like post data to their server from your CSS because CSS tried to                |
| [37:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2252.3)  | fetch a request.                                                                                       |
| [37:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2253.3)  | It's tried to fetch something at a URL and it just subsequently made a request so anyway               |
| [37:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2257.46) | there's also cross-eyed scripting attacks that way too.                                                |
| [37:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2260.06) | So yeah CSS you're functional and now you can even be hacked like a real language.                     |
| [37:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2265.34) | I'd brought it back I shouldn't have done that.                                                        |
| [37:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2267.46) | But I had I didn't know about these any of them I didn't know about the URL attacks like               |
| [37:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2272.66) | other attribute attacks I mean that makes sense I get those the billion laughs attack                  |
| [37:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2276.02) | I don't even know why you would use that like what seems like a fun fact but I did know                |
| [38:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2280.94) | about the visited security issues and that's why for the visited pseudo class you can only             |
| [38:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2287.54) | style very limited set of properties because what visit does is it gives information to                |
| [38:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2293.1)  | the website about where the user has been like on the page and so you can use that information         |
| [38:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2297.22) | to like send malicious information I guess through the URL attacks or attribute attacks                |
| [38:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2300.82) | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| [38:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2301.82) | Seriously yeah through JavaScript because yeah visit is a good one too because you can't               |
| [38:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2305.38) | get the computed color of a link and they do that because JavaScript was being used                    |
| [38:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2309.58) | to say was it purple or blue if it's purple they've been there and let's stash information             |
| [38:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2314.14) | we know about them and yeah good point there's uh creepy but powerful I guess I don't know.            |
| [38:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0TdScjKYIBNRnT9pSWKnn2?&t=2319.38) | You got to change the styling of your links friends.                                                   |
