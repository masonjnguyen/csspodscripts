| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility              |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=16.58)   | to z-index.                                                                                         |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=17.58)   | Today we're talking about CSS filters.                                                              |
| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=20.18)   | I love this underrated CSS property because filters allow for direct manipulation of pixels         |
| [00:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=25.42)   | on a screen and have so many benefits.                                                              |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=28.04)   | The 10 named CSS filters are shorthands for the most popular SVG filter effects, which              |
| [00:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=32.92)   | can get much more complex as you write them.                                                        |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=35.42)   | But we don't only have these 10 filters, there's also a URL parameter which allows                  |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=39.32)   | you to still define your filter in SVG and apply it in CSS.                                         |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=42.9)    | So the possibilities are truly endless.                                                             |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=45.4)    | Truly endless.                                                                                      |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=46.4)    | I mean, you're really not wrong there.                                                              |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=48.22)   | The matrix is huge.                                                                                 |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=49.22)   | You can do a lot of stuff.                                                                          |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=50.6)    | These were, as you said, originally designed for SVG.                                               |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=53.82)   | And you know, the sort of functional programming nerd in me is like, filters are pixel manipulation |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=58.88)   | pure functions.                                                                                     |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=60.24)   | They just take some pixels and they output some modified pixels and they will do that               |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=64.32)   | forever and always give you the same result back.                                                   |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=66.44)   | It's really neat.                                                                                   |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=67.44)   | So they process each pixel and then based on whatever it is you pass in the function,               |
| [01:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=71.6)    | perform an action and an effect on it.                                                              |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=73.32)   | And they work on CSS painted elements because browsers and CSS spec people are awesome.             |
| [01:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=78.68)   | And they were like, Hey, this is painted space.                                                     |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=80.2)    | Why don't we allow folks to manipulate the painted space with some painted space manipulators?      |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=84.08)   | Anyway, you could easily essentially apply an Instagram filter to your whole page.                  |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=89.28)   | Now, Yuna wouldn't know anything about creating Instagram filters with CSS though, right?           |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=96.04)   | I did create a project called CSS gram, which lets you apply some of the most popular Instagram     |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=101.28)  | filters via a single CSS class by using a mix of these CSS filters and layered color                |
| [01:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=106.52)  | with blend modes, which we'll talk about our next episode.                                          |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=109.74)  | But one really cool thing about filters too, is that they're interoperable unlike blend             |
| [01:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=114.4)   | modes, which means that you can animate between filter states.                                      |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=118.0)   | So with filters, you can make a great hover focus state and you can have those smoothly             |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=122.36)  | transition and they can even help in a pinch when you want uniform styles in your images            |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=126.88)  | without manipulating those images directly in a program like Photoshop.                             |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=130.48)  | You can do that directly in the browser, which I think is really cool and exciting.                 |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=134.96)  | So let's get started.                                                                               |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=135.96)  | Adam, where can we use filters?                                                                     |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=138.0)   | Well, the good news is we have support back to IE 10.                                               |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=142.52)  | Yeah yeah.                                                                                          |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=143.52)  | Before that, they even had a filter effect syntax.                                                  |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=146.12)  | Before that, they've had many syntaxes.                                                             |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=147.92)  | So IE 10 had some sort of filters before they were MS prefixed, if I remember right.                |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=152.64)  | But anyway, we have great support.                                                                  |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=154.36)  | You can essentially feel free to use these in your project today.                                   |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=157.62)  | So with the IE filters, though, I will say that the syntax is slightly different.                   |
| [02:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=161.98)  | So if you're using the modern CSS filter syntax that we're about to go through, just be careful.    |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=167.04)  | There are polyfills for these for Internet Explorer.                                                |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=170.64)  | So I'm pretty sure that PostGIS has a polyfill.                                                     |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=172.84)  | Check those out if you do want to make these work for older browsers.                               |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=177.08)  | So we're going to talk about the filter functions now.                                              |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=180.4)   | And these are going to be listed in order of operation for how they're applied to the               |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=183.92)  | image.                                                                                              |
| [03:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=184.92)  | So the first one is blur and blur takes a length that could be pixels, that could be                |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=188.64)  | REMS, that could be viewport units, even if you wanted to, even though that would be like           |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=192.92)  | a crazy large blur.                                                                                 |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=195.88)  | And blur basically creates a Gaussian blur on the entire element itself.                            |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=199.96)  | Very nice.                                                                                          |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=200.96)  | And I'm surprised that that's the first order of operation is that blurring happens and             |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=205.04)  | then the rest of these.                                                                             |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=206.04)  | So if yeah, if we're talking about order of operation, blur happens first.                          |
| [03:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=209.16)  | That kind of surprised me.                                                                          |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=210.56)  | Also like small tip with blur, little values go a long way.                                         |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=214.6)   | Yes, like four pixels.                                                                              |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=216.24)  | Like four pixels.                                                                                   |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=217.24)  | Because that's how much you're blurring every pixel.                                                |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=220.68)  | You're blurring that single pixel with the four pixels surrounding it to create a even              |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=225.2)   | distribution.                                                                                       |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=226.2)   | Yep.                                                                                                |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=227.2)   | So anyway, if I go over five pixels, I know I'm really blurring something.                          |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=230.16)  | Okay, the next function is brightness.                                                              |
| [03:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=232.68)  | And this takes a percentage.                                                                        |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=234.32)  | If your value is greater than one, you will increase the brightness of something.                   |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=238.52)  | And if your value is less than one, you will decrease the brightness.                               |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=242.0)   | So next we have contrast.                                                                           |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=243.44)  | This also takes a number of percentage.                                                             |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=245.8)   | So you can think of one as 100%.                                                                    |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=248.3)   | Anything less than one would be a like 30%, 40%, 50%.                                               |
| [04:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=251.88)  | Anything greater than that, you could do like two or 200%.                                          |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=254.76)  | So with contrast, like brightness, if it's greater than one or if it's greater than 100%,           |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=259.0)   | you're increasing the contrast.                                                                     |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=260.68)  | That's the difference between the light and dark values in your image and your element,             |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=265.08)  | whatever you're applying these filters to.                                                          |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=267.28)  | And if it's less than one, then you're decreasing it.                                               |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=269.32)  | So you're decreasing the contrast.                                                                  |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=271.0)   | You're making it less differentiated between those darks and light values, which is also            |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=275.52)  | a nice effect sometimes.                                                                            |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=276.52)  | Yeah, you can soften something up and sort of take a stark moment.                                  |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=280.52)  | So the next one is grayscale.                                                                       |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=281.52)  | This again takes a number of percentage similar to contrast and brightness.                         |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=285.92)  | And I did a quick little side note of research because we're about to cover saturation soon.        |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=291.1)   | And so I was like, what's the difference between grayscaling something and desaturating it?         |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=295.48)  | And anyway, so the interesting answer is that desaturation is just straight removed color.          |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=301.08)  | And so any vibrance that was in there is just kind of maintained, which means if two colors,        |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=304.9)   | like I don't know, blue and yellow have the same vibrance, by the time you desaturate               |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=308.4)   | them, they will be one color.                                                                       |
| [05:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=310.12)  | But if you grayscale something, some of that perceptual information that's in the color             |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=314.64)  | will be maintained.                                                                                 |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=315.94)  | And so you will still see a difference between those two colors after you grayscale it versus       |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=321.06)  | desaturate it.                                                                                      |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=322.06)  | So anyway, you can grayscale things with a filter and it might be beneficial to do that             |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=326.48)  | versus desaturation.                                                                                |
| [05:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=327.48)  | That's a really interesting point because I know in Photoshop there is a black and white            |
| [05:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=332.28)  | thing you can apply.                                                                                |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=333.28)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=334.28)  | It's an effect.                                                                                     |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=335.28)  | And when you apply the black and white, it actually prompts you to change the color values          |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=338.68)  | of the cyans and the greens to get the black and white effect that you want when you are            |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=344.4)   | applying grayscale.                                                                                 |
| [05:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=345.72)  | So it sounds like this grayscale is doing the same thing where it's using some of those             |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=349.8)   | perceptual adjustments.                                                                             |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=351.0)   | Yes, that's 100% correct.                                                                           |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=352.88)  | It is mimicking the black and white Photoshop filter as opposed to desaturation or the saturate     |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=358.56)  | filter, which don't do that.                                                                        |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=359.96)  | And yeah, it's often advised to use the black and white feature of Photoshop to black and           |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=365.24)  | white a photo as opposed to desaturating it.                                                        |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=368.04)  | Because you do.                                                                                     |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=369.04)  | If you get more information and some richer perceptual data will still be in there.                 |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=373.4)   | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=374.4)   | Anyway, cool.                                                                                       |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=375.4)   | Thanks for letting me go down that little side channel.                                             |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=376.4)   | I thought it was cool.                                                                              |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=378.0)   | The next filter effect is the invert function.                                                      |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=382.04)  | So with invert, you can optionally put a value here.                                                |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=385.82)  | And again, if the number is greater than one, well, it can't be greater than one.                   |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=390.2)   | You can only invert to 100%.                                                                        |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=391.88)  | So you can only invert to 100%.                                                                     |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=393.72)  | But if you invert it like 0.5, that's 50%, the entire image becomes a 50% gray, just                |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=400.28)  | the color gray.                                                                                     |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=401.78)  | Because you're inverting the light values and the dark values the same exact amount,                |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=406.3)   | and it ends up being the exact same color, which is a 50% gray.                                     |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=409.8)   | So if it's less than 0.5 here, you're going to invert it like in a negative way.                    |
| [06:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=415.98)  | And if it's greater, it's completely inverted.                                                      |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=418.28)  | The darks are light, the lights are dark, like the black values be white and vice versa.            |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=423.2)   | Now as I mentioned earlier, this does not require a value.                                          |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=427.18)  | If you have just invert, and then just open and close parentheses, it's going to assume             |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=431.74)  | that is 100% inversion.                                                                             |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=433.98)  | And it'll just invert it completely that way.                                                       |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=436.64)  | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=437.64)  | And if you're building a Halloween website, invert is really nice.                                  |
| [07:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=440.64)  | You can make all of your pictures very creepy very quickly.                                         |
| [07:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=444.08)  | And then have them flash.                                                                           |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=445.08)  | And have them flash.                                                                                |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=446.08)  | There's also I've seen this tip, or it's not a tip, but there's a very hacky but semi efficient     |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=450.84)  | strategy for making a dark version of your website with invert.                                     |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=453.98)  | So if you have a light website, what I've seen is they invert the whole body, and then              |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=457.96)  | they find every image in every icon, and they invert it back.                                       |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=461.3)   | So they un-inverted.                                                                                |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=462.4)   | So they invert everything, and then they un-invert stuff that they inverted on accident, which      |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=466.56)  | is why it's kind of a smelly solution.                                                              |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=468.26)  | But it can be kind of a nice one, too.                                                              |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=469.98)  | It can be very swift.                                                                               |
| [07:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=470.98)  | You know, this is a tangent.                                                                        |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=472.8)   | But going back to contrast, I one time did something similar where I was playing with               |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=478.32)  | image performance optimization, and in Photoshop, if you do a linear decontrast of the image,       |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=486.36)  | so you remove contrast by, say, 50%, you're removing image information, so the image becomes        |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=491.7)   | much smaller, like 20% to 30% smaller.                                                              |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=494.82)  | Then you can add that contrast back with the contrast filter in CSS, and the image looks            |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=500.32)  | the same, but it's much smaller.                                                                    |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=502.64)  | So this totally works.                                                                              |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=504.6)   | The pros and cons are, like, you can't save the image down, which a photographer could              |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=509.2)   | like, because then people can't steal their photography or their artwork.                           |
| [08:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=513.52)  | But when you also share it in the social share preview images, you're going to see the decontrasted |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=518.96)  | image, too, because, you know, you don't know that that information is being adjusted.              |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=523.2)   | But yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff that you can do with, like, adding filters or moving          |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=526.88)  | filters.                                                                                            |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=527.88)  | And because Adobe are the folks who implemented a lot of these in the browser initially, it         |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=533.72)  | works really well with how the Photoshop model is and how these effects and the math sort           |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=540.16)  | of pairs one to one, at least the old way to remove contrast, which is still available              |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=545.72)  | in Photoshop, with the filter effects in the browser.                                               |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=548.88)  | Right, makes sense.                                                                                 |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=549.88)  | They're functions, and the browser functions were just mimicking the same input and output          |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=553.6)   | that were coming from those Photoshop ones.                                                         |
| [09:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=555.76)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=556.76)  | Totally makes sense.                                                                                |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=557.76)  | That is a really cool trick you just shared.                                                        |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=559.12)  | I think I'm going to be chewing on that for a couple of days.                                       |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=561.6)   | I'll share a link in the show notes.                                                                |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=563.32)  | Yeah, awesome.                                                                                      |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=564.32)  | All right.                                                                                          |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=565.32)  | Our next filter function to talk about is opacity, and this takes a number percentage               |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=569.32)  | as well.                                                                                            |
| [09:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=570.32)  | And you could use this or you could use the opacity standalone property.                            |
| [09:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=574.4)   | But I think maybe one of the use cases of opacity being in the filter list is, again,               |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=578.56)  | where we've shared these in order of operation, and this is operation number six.                   |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=583.08)  | So maybe you want your opacity to happen in this order of operations, as opposed to being           |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=588.04)  | some sort of mass effect that happened earlier.                                                     |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=591.4)   | So anyway, opacity is a filter function you can use, and it works just as you'd expect.             |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=595.64)  | It takes a number or percentage.                                                                    |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=597.72)  | Next we have saturate.                                                                              |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=599.78)  | Saturate increases the saturation of the color of the image.                                        |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=605.08)  | And if you have a value greater than one, it's going to increase saturation.                        |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=607.4)   | You can desaturate with less than one.                                                              |
| [10:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=609.6)   | So if you do saturate zero, you will get a grayscale effect, as we were talking about               |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=613.52)  | before.                                                                                             |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=614.52)  | This could create some really interesting visuals.                                                  |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=617.04)  | And if you do a saturate value of 300, you're going to see some crazy posterized sort of            |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=622.24)  | vibes.                                                                                              |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=623.64)  | So yeah, saturate.                                                                                  |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=625.64)  | It's there.                                                                                         |

| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=627.64)  | Awesome.                                                                                            |

| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=633.96)  | That's good.                                                                                        |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=634.96)  | Next function is sepia.                                                                             |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=635.96)  | Sepia, if you've never heard of this effect, it sort of creates an old-timey brown, tan,            |

| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=643.2)   | I'm not sure what the math actually is, but you have a note here that it's based on the             |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=647.36)  | Effie color matrix preset.                                                                          |

| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=651.12)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=652.12)  | So with SVG filter effects, one of the filter effects that adjusts the RGB and alpha channels       |
| [10:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=656.98)  | at the same time is called the Effie color matrix.                                                  |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=659.98)  | And it is a four by four matrix of values that you can adjust.                                      |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=664.68)  | And the default matrix looks like 1000, 0100, 0010.                                                 |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=668.44)  | It's like a diagonal.                                                                               |

| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=673.0)   | And so with sepia, there's a specific color value number in that color matrix that applies          |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=679.44)  | this transformation for your image to look faded and sort of yellowed and vintage looking.          |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=684.8)   | And the sepia effect is a shorthand to what the Effie color matrix presents as the transformation   |
| [11:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=692.48)  | to 100% sepia.                                                                                      |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=694.78)  | And so what this filter does is like the number of percent you put in here applies a percentage     |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=699.28)  | of that filter on top of the layer.                                                                 |

| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=702.12)  | It's like a custom property.                                                                        |

| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=708.0)   | sepia and then let us call it with a function just like how much sepia do you want?                 |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=712.44)  | That's basically it.                                                                                |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=713.44)  | I mean, that's my understanding at least of sepia specifically and how it relates to the            |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=717.72)  | SVG filter effects, which were the precursor and the basis of these CSS filters.                    |
| [12:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=722.68)  | I love it.                                                                                          |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=723.68)  | I need to go study Effie color matrix more because we are talking about color manipulation          |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=727.52)  | in our spec draft that we're working on and there's some destructuring syntax in there              |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=732.4)   | that I wonder how much this color matrix is overlapping because it is.                              |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=736.96)  | It's taking out individual color channels.                                                          |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=739.2)   | We're side noting a little bit, but thank you.                                                      |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=741.52)  | This was superbly interesting.                                                                      |

| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=748.8)   | We could potentially share some links to that too if we have room for all these links.              |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=751.8)   | This stuff is just so fascinating.                                                                  |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=753.92)  | I find this topic to be really interesting to me as somebody who comes from a design                |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=759.0)   | background learned Photoshop first, like when I was literally 12, probably even younger.            |
| [12:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=765.8)   | I'm now converting that sort of perspective into web development.                                   |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=769.44)  | This topic I think is really, really cool.                                                          |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=771.28)  | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=772.28)  | Hue rotate is next and this one's actually my favorite because what hue rotate allows               |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=776.96)  | is for you to rotate the colors in an image or an element along the color wheel.                    |
| [13:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=783.12)  | I love doing this with animation, so rotating the hue from zero to 360 degrees infinitely           |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=791.44)  | on hover or focus states.                                                                           |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=793.6)   | I don't know why I do this all the time, but we talked about this in the animation show             |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=797.28)  | as well.                                                                                            |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=798.28)  | It's just a fun one.                                                                                |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=799.28)  | I think that hue rotate creates some really interesting effects and allows for you to               |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=802.8)   | apply different themes very quickly for different elements just by adjusting one filter.            |
| [13:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=809.2)   | Hue rotate, it's pretty cool.                                                                       |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=811.44)  | Totally agree.                                                                                      |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=812.44)  | Our next one is drop shadow.                                                                        |
| [13:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=815.38)  | Drop shadow is kind of a special filter in that it can do a shadow that no other tool               |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=821.12)  | can.                                                                                                |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=822.12)  | The reason that it can do this is because it's working on the painted space as opposed              |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=824.96)  | to the box.                                                                                         |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=826.12)  | If your brain can never remember like mine still can't, the difference between box shadow           |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=831.42)  | and drop shadow, I mean it's in the name, right?                                                    |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=833.92)  | The first one's a box shadow.                                                                       |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=835.2)   | It is applying a shadow to the box.                                                                 |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=836.96)  | The next one is a drop shadow, but it just doesn't, I don't know, it doesn't sound the              |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=841.32)  | same.                                                                                               |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=842.32)  | What it's especially good for is let's say you have a box with like a little triangle               |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=845.44)  | at the bottom or you have an SVG shape that's your icon and you want to cast a shadow from          |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=851.0)   | that that is the shadow from the painted space, not from the box that it's within.                  |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=855.64)  | This is where drop shadow is invaluable.                                                            |
| [14:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=858.48)  | You just place this filter function on there and you can specify with nearly the same syntax        |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=862.72)  | that you can with the box shadow, a shadow that is the exact shape of the element that              |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=867.58)  | you applied it to.                                                                                  |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=868.9)   | It's super neat.                                                                                    |
| [14:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=869.9)   | It's exactly like the one you would find in Photoshop as well.                                      |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=872.12)  | So if you've ever applied a shadow in Photoshop and saw it as the shape of the element, this        |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=876.34)  | is the one, this is what you've been looking for, if you've never heard of it.                      |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=879.56)  | Anyway, drop dash shadow.                                                                           |

| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=882.16)  | I like it.                                                                                          |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=883.16)  | The next filter function would be URL.                                                              |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=884.96)  | So you can still use SVG filter effects to write the effects that you want to apply.                |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=891.34)  | This gives you a lot more power.                                                                    |

| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=898.0)   | But for example, we talked about the color matrix.                                                  |

| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=904.5)   | orange shadows and create some sort of interesting effect, you can still access that through        |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=909.52)  | CSS with the URL function.                                                                          |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=911.6)   | You would just tie that URL function to the name of the SVG filter effect that you're               |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=915.44)  | providing in the SVG.                                                                               |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=917.4)   | So the catch with this is the SVG needs to be available on the page in line and does                |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=922.66)  | not work if you're serving it through a link.                                                       |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=924.94)  | And that's because when SVGs are read as links, they're usually parsed as images.                   |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=930.24)  | What you can do, though, is have it in a separate file and then do like an inject as HTML sort      |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=936.36)  | of vibe.                                                                                            |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=937.36)  | But it has to be on the page so that you can read the ID of that filter to then apply it            |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=943.96)  | to the image or the element itself.                                                                 |
| [15:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=947.32)  | But really useful when you are playing with more advanced filters, you're playing with              |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=951.08)  | a real instrument, playing with all of these fun effects that the CSS named filters don't           |
| [15:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=956.72)  | give you, you can do and apply them with URL.                                                       |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=960.28)  | It's a really nice way to share super custom effects as well.                                       |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=964.78)  | It's really powerful.                                                                               |
| [16:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=965.78)  | And yeah, you broke that down well.                                                                 |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=966.92)  | It's just that SVG markup needs to be on the page in the HTML just like hidden.                     |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=971.0)   | It's invisible instruction.                                                                         |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=972.92)  | It's like present so that it can just be referenced and you only need one and then as many filters  |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=977.28)  | can use it as possible.                                                                             |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=978.92)  | It is tricky, though, getting that set up.                                                          |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=981.0)   | So if you're struggling, don't worry, fight through it, you'll figure it out.                       |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=984.0)   | And once it's working, you can build upon it and do something very extraordinary.                   |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=987.44)  | URL, very invaluable.                                                                               |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=989.28)  | And the last one we have here, which was removed from the spec in 2016 but got an honorable         |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=993.64)  | mention is custom.                                                                                  |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=995.52)  | And this is the ability for you to pass a custom shader into the filter workflow.                   |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1000.88) | And you can watch videos, we'll have them in the show notes where Paul Lewis goes and               |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1003.96) | creates these very, very three dimensional effects with shaders and maybe you remember              |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1009.56) | back in the day when Adobe announced CSS shaders and using these and they had a curtain demo.       |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1015.92) | Did you ever see the curtain that would fold and unfold like a real cloth curtain and it            |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1019.92) | was dumb?                                                                                           |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1020.92) | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1022.38) | It was amazing.                                                                                     |
| [17:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1023.48) | But apparently it's like from 2012 or something.                                                    |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1025.68) | But yeah, we still don't have anything like that.                                                   |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1027.86) | And it was through this custom filter shader strategy that just got cut probably because            |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1033.88) | it was too complex.                                                                                 |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1034.88) | But anyway, it's kind of cool, honorable mention.                                                   |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1036.88) | We used to be able to pass custom shaders into the filter.                                          |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1039.84) | So speaking of things that aren't fully supported but are cool, backdrop filter, that was a         |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1045.64) | really bad transition.                                                                              |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1046.64) | Backdrop filter is a newer CSS property that is supported in Chromium.                              |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1052.66) | So that's Chrome and Edge, Safari, Opera, and Firefox behind a flag.                                |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1057.32) | And what this allows for you to do is apply filter effects behind the element, not on               |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1061.8)  | the element.                                                                                        |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1062.8)  | So let's take for example, blur.                                                                    |
| [17:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1065.4)  | If I was to use filter blur on an element, the entire element appears blurry.                       |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1070.68) | So if I had a card with text on it, the text content as well as the background would appear         |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1077.16) | blurry.                                                                                             |
| [17:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1078.16) | But if I applied backdrop filter blur, say blur five pixels, this would apply a blur                |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1084.6)  | as the background of that card only behind the element itself.                                      |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1088.56) | So if I move the card around, you would see how that blur interacted with the content               |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1093.76) | behind it, which is kind of similar to a mixed blend mode, how it's interacting with the            |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1097.84) | background behind it on the page.                                                                   |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1100.42) | You could think of like an iOS messaging app with like the blurry background.                       |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1103.82) | So you could sort of move that around on your OS screen and you still see the text very             |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1107.76) | clearly but the blurring of the background lets you read it more legibly while at the               |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1112.36) | same time providing context to where it lives on the page because you can sort of see right         |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1115.96) | behind it.                                                                                          |
| [18:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1117.04) | So backdrop filter is really cool.                                                                  |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1119.28) | With the blur filter, again, not only would the text be blurry, but you also wouldn't               |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1123.12) | have that blur interacting with the elements behind it.                                             |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1127.08) | You would sort of see it if it was not fully opaque.                                                |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1130.64) | But with the backdrop filter, you can have opaque colors that are blurred out and you               |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1135.0)  | see sort of the interaction behind it.                                                              |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1137.92) | So that's pretty cool.                                                                              |
| [18:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1139.24) | You can also apply any of the other filters.                                                        |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1141.64) | You can apply saturation.                                                                           |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1143.4)  | You can apply hue rotation.                                                                         |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1145.36) | You can apply contrast or brightness.                                                               |
| [19:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1147.2)  | I think brightness goes really well with blur if you're trying to increase legibility of            |
| [19:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1150.46) | something whether it's dark or lighter.                                                             |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1152.5)  | So pretty cool property to use backdrop filter, not just filter.                                    |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1158.36) | So like we mentioned also earlier, these are based on SVG filters.                                  |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1162.8)  | SVG filters themselves have very good support.                                                      |
| [19:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1165.76) | These do go back to IE 10, which is why a lot of the CSS filters can be polyfilled with             |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1170.0)  | SVG filters.                                                                                        |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1172.08) | Let's just quickly run through some of those so you have an understanding of how robust             |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1175.76) | this ecosystem is.                                                                                  |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1176.76) | Yeah, I don't think a lot of people know that a lot of these are there.                             |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1179.32) | Like one of the coolest ones, which I think you're good, is turbulence and a displacement           |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1183.6)  | map.                                                                                                |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1184.6)  | These things are amazing.                                                                           |
| [19:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1185.6)  | So the first one we have here is blend.                                                             |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1186.68) | It's called Effie blend.                                                                            |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1187.8)  | It's his camel case and it's similar to CSS blend modes, but this function describes how            |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1191.36) | images interact via a blend mode.                                                                   |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1193.48) | It's like how to blend.                                                                             |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1195.08) | Yes.                                                                                                |
| [19:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1196.08) | So that's exactly it.                                                                               |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1197.08) | That's like how blend modes work basically.                                                         |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1199.32) | There's different types.                                                                            |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1201.84) | There is Effie component transfer, which is an umbrella term for a function that alters             |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1206.28) | individual RGBA channels.                                                                           |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1208.04) | So Effie funk G or Effie funk B would be an example of one of these functions through               |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1214.8)  | that channel specifically.                                                                          |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1216.56) | That's a sick rapper name.                                                                          |
| [20:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1218.4)  | Yo, yo Effie funk G is in the house.                                                                |
| [20:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1220.52) | I'm bringing component transfers.                                                                   |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1222.2)  | Anyway, okay, that was such a like high level dev joke.                                             |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1228.96) | The next SVG filter is Fe composite and this is a filter primitive that defines pixel level         |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1234.76) | image interaction.                                                                                  |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1236.04) | So how do these pixels composite together?                                                          |
| [20:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1238.6)  | Then there's Effie convolve matrix and this filter dictates how pixels interact with their          |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1242.72) | close neighbors.                                                                                    |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1243.72) | So this is what allows for blurring or even sharpening of the image itself.                         |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1247.72) | Cool.                                                                                               |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1248.72) | Fe diffuse lighting defines a light source.                                                         |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1250.92) | Effie displacement map displaces an image, which is the input in and uses the pixel values          |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1257.92) | of another input input to so in two to apply the displacement.                                      |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1262.0)  | I need to dig into those.                                                                           |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1263.36) | I used to do tons of Photoshop displacement map stuff.                                              |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1266.56) | Did you ever do that?                                                                               |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1267.56) | Not really.                                                                                         |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1268.56) | I'm very curious to see like what you used it for.                                                  |
| [21:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1270.34) | So I made a bunch of shirts and I would put logos on a shirt and the logo would bend and            |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1274.84) | fold with the folds of the shirt because the shirt had black and white data.                        |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1278.84) | I would use the black and white data as depth data, send the data as a displacement map             |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1283.28) | to displace my original artwork.                                                                    |
| [21:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1285.04) | And now it would wobble and wiggle with the folds of a shirt and looked like it was really          |
| [21:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1288.9)  | on there.                                                                                           |
| [21:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1289.9)  | That's a really good example.                                                                       |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1290.9)  | Yeah, thanks.                                                                                       |
| [21:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1291.9)  | Yeah, you could do that on a page right now.                                                        |
| [21:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1293.38) | So you could go to a website and displace your whole logo with a ripple effect and you              |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1296.92) | can animate these, right?                                                                           |
| [21:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1298.32) | Oh, that's so cool.                                                                                 |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1299.32) | Okay, so yes.                                                                                       |
| [21:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1300.32) | Oh wait, you know who has a really cool example of a displacement map?                              |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1304.2)  | That's a nice, simple and tangible.                                                                 |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1306.12) | Good one too is Leah Verou showing you that you can use the turbulence and displacement             |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1310.56) | map to make text jiggle.                                                                            |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1312.28) | If you've seen that comic book effect where this like hand drawn squiggly text, she recreates       |
| [21:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1316.56) | that with CSS.                                                                                      |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1317.56) | Yeah, Sarah Suedan also has some really cool displacement map and turbulence effects on             |
| [22:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1323.12) | text to check out.                                                                                  |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1325.22) | So we'll hopefully have room for all these links we want to share in the show notes.                |
| [22:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1328.64) | Yeah, we'll just cut out all our stuff about ourselves, you know, and make room for all             |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1332.0)  | the links.                                                                                          |
| [22:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1333.0)  | I think it's worth it.                                                                              |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1334.0)  | Okay, the next one is Effie Flood, which is a complete fill of the filter subregion with            |
| [22:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1337.0)  | a specified color and alpha level.                                                                  |
| [22:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1339.4)  | Can you explain that one better?                                                                    |
| [22:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1340.4)  | I can't.                                                                                            |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1341.4)  | So this is just a flood.                                                                            |
| [22:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1342.4)  | So if you wanted to flood color to apply a blend from, this allows you to create a color            |
| [22:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1347.8)  | of flood to do other effects with basically.                                                        |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1351.0)  | Oh, like a colorize function.                                                                       |
| [22:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1352.8)  | Yeah, like gives you another layer within the Effie filter effect.                                  |
| [22:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1356.36) | Cool.                                                                                               |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1357.36) | So there's Effie Gaussian Blur.                                                                     |
| [22:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1358.68) | This is similar to the Effie Convolve Matrix that allows you to do the blurring sharpening.         |
| [22:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1363.28) | But this one is specifically a Gaussian style blur.                                                 |
| [22:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1365.96) | There are different types of blurs that you can apply.                                              |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1367.74) | If you are intimately familiar with Photoshop, you've probably tried out the different types        |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1371.02) | of blurs.                                                                                           |
| [22:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1372.02) | Gaussian Blur is the most popular.                                                                  |
| [22:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1373.02) | This is what CSS uses.                                                                              |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1374.56) | And this just blurs pixels using an input standard deviation.                                       |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1378.88) | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [23:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1379.88) | We have Effie Image, and this is for use with other filters like Effie Blender, Effie Composite.    |
| [23:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1384.72) | There's Effie Merge that allows for asynchronous application of filter effects instead of layering  |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1389.48) | them, which I have not used, but I find this one really interesting.                                |
| [23:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1393.16) | Wow.                                                                                                |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1394.16) | Okay, interesting.                                                                                  |
| [23:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1395.6)  | That is going to play in well with our conversation about isolation, which is in our next episode.  |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1401.0)  | Yes, exactly, exactly.                                                                              |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1402.72) | Interesting.                                                                                        |
| [23:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1403.72) | Okay, so CSS isolation and this merging is really cool.                                             |
| [23:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1408.72) | Okay, so then we have Effie Morphology, which is a roads or dilates lines of source graphics.       |
| [23:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1414.84) | Think strokes on text.                                                                              |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1418.04) | There's Effie Offset, and this is used for creating drop shadows.                                   |
| [23:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1421.2)  | Oh, cool.                                                                                           |
| [23:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1422.2)  | And I've seen really gooey effects done with that as well.                                          |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1424.84) | Very nice.                                                                                          |
| [23:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1425.84) | Effie Specular Lighting, which is sourced for the alpha component as a bump map.                    |
| [23:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1429.4)  | Oh, nice.                                                                                           |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1430.4)  | Bump map is similar to what we were talking about earlier.                                          |
| [23:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1432.88) | The specular portion of Phong Reflection Model.                                                     |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1435.24) | Yes, okay, so this is a black and white picture.                                                    |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1437.52) | It could be a bump map or what I mentioned earlier is like normals or a depth map being             |
| [24:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1442.4)  | used as the specular portion of your element.                                                       |
| [24:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1445.64) | So yes, you're showing where the highlights and the shiny parts are if you had a light              |
| [24:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1449.76) | source.                                                                                             |
| [24:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1450.76) | I love it.                                                                                          |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1451.76) | That's so cool.                                                                                     |
| [24:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1452.76) | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [24:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1453.76) | And there's also Effie Tile, which refers to how an image is repeated to fill a space.              |
| [24:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1458.12) | So you could do some cool tiled effects in SVG.                                                     |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1462.68) | Retro video games.                                                                                  |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1464.32) | And the final one here is Effie Turbulence, and it allows the creation of synthetic textures        |
| [24:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1469.08) | using Perlin Noise.                                                                                 |
| [24:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1470.64) | It's almost like how in every Photoshop demo that you ever started back in 2010 was, okay,          |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1477.68) | now create some clouds.                                                                             |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1482.28) | Create some organic natural stuff.                                                                  |
| [24:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1483.88) | I don't know about you, but I started by making like CD album covers for the music I never          |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1489.36) | wrote.                                                                                              |
| [24:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1490.36) | That's how I started doing Photoshop.                                                               |
| [24:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1491.36) | Yeah, so you definitely were making clouds.                                                         |
| [24:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1493.28) | Anyway, so Effie Turbulence is like a way of bringing some natural noise to be used                 |
| [24:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1497.64) | as some sort of organic randomness in other effects.                                                |
| [25:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1501.84) | Very cool.                                                                                          |
| [25:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1502.84) | Yeah, I think that it's just such a really cool topic to see how much of this image effect          |
| [25:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1510.8)  | magic you can do directly in the browser through CSS and SVG manipulation.                          |

| [25:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1519.32) | Again, they're interoperable, so you can animate them.                                              |
| [25:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1522.14) | They are not going to be permanent on your pixels, so they're just applying a layer onto            |
| [25:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1527.72) | your images, which is cool because they're non-destructive.                                         |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E2B76Crmivzr9788HaM2J?&t=1530.44) | And there's just so many cool effects that you can do.                                              |
