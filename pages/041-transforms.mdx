| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.           |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=17.62)   | On the docket for today's episode, our CSS transforms.                                             |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=21.62)   | Transforms let you stretch, shrink, move, flip, squash, and do a bunch of other neat               |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=25.56)   | things to your UI elements.                                                                        |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=27.56)   | They're often used for transitions or animations and can make some pretty neat effects.            |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=32.4)    | Transforms are particularly useful because they enable more performant CSS animations              |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=36.04)   | by creating a new composite layer and then applying those styles.                                  |
| [00:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=40.08)   | So if you work with animations on the web, keep listening.                                         |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=42.52)   | Oh yeah.                                                                                           |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=43.6)    | And let's start with that transform property.                                                      |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=45.86)   | So this is just transform colon.                                                                   |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=48.4)    | And what's interesting about transforms is they're not physical, right?                            |
| [00:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=51.8)    | It's not top or left.                                                                              |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=53.0)    | It's not logical.                                                                                  |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=54.0)    | It's not block start or inline start, but it's two dimensional until you reach into                |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=58.84)   | the third dimension.                                                                               |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=60.24)   | So I was thinking about this while prepping.                                                       |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=62.92)   | I was like, this is just an entirely new coordinate system.                                        |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=66.04)   | So while it feels kind of familiar to left and top, X and Y and Z are a mathematically             |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=73.16)   | different concept in space.                                                                        |
| [01:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=75.18)   | So anyway, that'll kind of illuminate more as we keep going.                                       |
| [01:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=77.72)   | So the transform property accepts a transforms list.                                               |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=80.88)   | So that's the meta data type that you can find in the CSS spec.                                    |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=85.0)    | And a transforms list is a list of transformations, right?                                         |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=88.48)   | It's kind of what it sounds like.                                                                  |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=89.8)    | But in CSS, we get declarative access to some very complex underlying power in this transforms     |
| [01:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=95.64)   | list.                                                                                              |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=96.64)   | So the list eventually serializes into either a 2D or a 3D matrix because it's math.               |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=101.7)   | All transform functions can be represented as a four by four transformation matrix.                |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=105.68)  | Think of the matrix as the common denominator data type between game engines or web apps           |
| [01:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=111.44)  | and stuff like that.                                                                               |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=112.76)  | Anything that's moving things in a 2D or 3D space is going to be using a matrix.                   |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=117.86)  | And it turns those steps for moving and transforming objects into 2D or 3D space.                  |
| [02:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=123.12)  | So that matrix gets turned into steps.                                                             |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=126.1)   | One thing has to happen before the other.                                                          |
| [02:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=127.76)  | So you'll hopefully recognize many of the transforms that we're going to talk about                |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=131.32)  | today from tools like After Effects, Sketch, or ScreenFlow, like Scale or Rotate.                  |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=136.08)  | They're the building blocks of pretty much all digital animation.                                  |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=139.62)  | So the transform list is giving you access to all of those keywords that you know and              |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=144.6)   | love.                                                                                              |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=145.6)   | And what's really important to note here is order matters.                                         |
| [02:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=147.88)  | The transform functions are multiplied in order from left to right.                                |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=151.38)  | So just briefly, if you think about a piece of paper that you're holding up in front of            |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=154.64)  | your face, if you rotate it 90 degrees, X and Y just changed on you.                               |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=161.3)   | X is now going to move it up and down.                                                             |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=163.4)   | That's why order matters is if you moved it on X first, so like let's say it's in front            |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=167.84)  | of your face and you move it by X and you move it to the right and then you rotate it.             |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=172.04)  | Now it's easier for you to know where you moved it because you rotated it after.                   |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=175.7)   | But if you rotate it first and then try to move it, it has its own little coordinates.             |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=179.16)  | So anyway, this stuff can get really complex really fast and that's why order matters and          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=182.98)  | we'll continue to break down these complex topics through the rest of the episode.                 |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=187.58)  | You know, why don't you take us through 2D transforms?                                             |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=190.0)   | Yeah, that's a really good point with the order mattering because this is something                |
| [03:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=194.28)  | that could catch up on you.                                                                        |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=195.88)  | So with things like CSS filters or other types of transformations where you have a space           |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=203.68)  | separated list of options, order doesn't really matter.                                            |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=207.64)  | It could, but here it really matters because it makes like a very big difference.                  |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=212.44)  | So that is important to note.                                                                      |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=214.2)   | With all these transform functions that we're going to talk about, you're going to be using        |
| [03:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=217.32)  | them on the right side of that property value declaration for your CSS.                            |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=224.66)  | So there's a transform property and all these transforms that we're going to get into, you're      |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=228.4)   | using as a space separated list together or alone on the right hand side as the input              |
| [03:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=236.28)  | value for what you're transforming.                                                                |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=238.64)  | So first we have 2D transforms and that is a two dimensional plane.                                |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=242.56)  | So think of XY, think of like when you're in a math class like plotting things on the              |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=247.44)  | XY coordinate plane.                                                                               |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=250.28)  | It's the 2D piece of paper or monitor that you're looking at.                                      |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=255.12)  | So that is the 2D plane.                                                                           |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=257.72)  | And the first function that we can do as a 2D transformation is to scale something.                |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=262.44)  | So scaling something either increases or decreases the size of that component or element on that   |
| [04:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=269.72)  | 2D plane, so through the X and Y axis.                                                             |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=272.84)  | It accepts either one or two values.                                                               |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=274.44)  | For one value it scales both the X and Y axis the same amount.                                     |
| [04:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=280.04)  | And for two values it's independent scaling, so the X axis one direction, the Y axis the           |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=284.12)  | other direction.                                                                                   |
| [04:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=285.48)  | So if the value that you're putting in here is greater than one, that makes it bigger.             |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=290.52)  | If it's less than one, it makes it smaller.                                                        |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=293.7)   | You could do a numeric value like one to mean 100% or you can use a percentage.                    |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=298.74)  | So as an example you could do scale 1.5 and that would equal 150% the original size.               |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=306.12)  | That would be larger, 150% of the original size would be like 50% bigger.                          |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=312.12)  | I think technically it's called like 150% bigger of the original size because it's increasing.     |
| [05:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=316.88)  | And another example would be something like scale 0.5 comma 1.2.                                   |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=323.0)   | This would make it half the size in the X axis, so squeezing it, and then 120% so larger           |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=329.88)  | on the Y axis.                                                                                     |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=330.88)  | So it's kind of like you're taking like a little thing that you're squeezing on the                |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=334.6)   | sides and kind of coming out the top and bottom.                                                   |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=337.24)  | So you can do these also individually.                                                             |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=340.14)  | Scale X and scale Y are the individual functions where you could put arguments and those only      |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=344.84)  | take a single value because you're only doing them independently, but then scales shorthand        |
| [05:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=349.52)  | for both of those.                                                                                 |
| [05:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=350.52)  | Excellent.                                                                                         |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=351.52)  | So next is translate.                                                                              |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=353.28)  | This is shorthand for translate X and translate Y so you can access those as individual properties |
| [05:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=357.68)  | as well.                                                                                           |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=358.68)  | And these accept lengths or percentages and the values default to zero.                            |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=363.2)   | So if you pass one value into the shorthand, so translate 10 pixels, it will be used for           |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=368.88)  | X and then Y will default to zero.                                                                 |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=371.34)  | So unlike scale where it sort of shares them, these are individually, they'll default to           |
| [06:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=375.88)  | zero.                                                                                              |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=376.88)  | And if you're translating X, like let's say you're looking at a piece of paper straight            |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=380.4)   | on, this would be the horizontal space.                                                            |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=382.36)  | So you'd be moving something essentially left and right on this translated X property.             |
| [06:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=387.48)  | And if you translated Y, it would be moving it up and down visually.                               |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=390.22)  | So it'd be traveling along vertically.                                                             |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=392.56)  | For example, like a classic animation, translate Y would be used for a bouncing ball while         |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=397.2)   | translate X would be used for a flying jet plane.                                                  |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=399.88)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=400.88)  | And then we have rotate and this function is pretty straightforward.                               |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=404.28)  | It rotates an element around and by default it rotates it around the center point on a             |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=408.88)  | 2D plane.                                                                                          |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=409.92)  | So this only accepts one value.                                                                    |
| [06:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=411.04)  | It could be any angle value, degrees, turns, radians, et cetera.                                   |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=414.8)   | And it could be positive or negative.                                                              |
| [06:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=416.88)  | If the value is positive, it rotates it clockwise.                                                 |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=419.44)  | If it's negative, it rotates it counterclockwise.                                                  |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=422.52)  | And it defaults it from the center point for rotation.                                             |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=425.6)   | But if you change the transform origin property, then it will change the origin from which         |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=430.44)  | it rotates.                                                                                        |
| [07:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=431.44)  | So you could set the transform origin to something like 50% zero and then it would rotate it       |
| [07:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=437.74)  | from the top center.                                                                               |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=439.34)  | So you rotate around the top center point.                                                         |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=441.94)  | The default is 50-50, 50%, 50% because that's center point.                                        |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=445.7)   | But it's important to note the transform origin can adjust where any of these things are being     |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=450.76)  | transformed from as well.                                                                          |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=452.96)  | Totally.                                                                                           |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=453.96)  | Transform origin becomes super critical as you build more complex scenes.                          |
| [07:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=458.84)  | Absolutely.                                                                                        |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=459.92)  | The next function is called skew and this is shorthand for skew X and skew Y.                      |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=464.64)  | This is a property that accepts angles as a value.                                                 |
| [07:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=468.24)  | So skew as like a base function exists for compatibility regions and should not be used.           |
| [07:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=473.18)  | So in the spec it says skew as shorthand, avoid it.                                                |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=477.72)  | They've essentially aliased it to skew X and skew Y for you.                                       |
| [08:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=481.28)  | Just kind of an interesting little back note there.                                                |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=483.5)   | And this effect when applied to a box, for example, it's like the box is leaning.                  |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=488.88)  | So skewing X is like the bottom corners of a box moved away from the top corners of the            |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=493.08)  | box horizontally.                                                                                  |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=495.28)  | Like making a vertical pipe character into a slash, right?                                         |
| [08:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=498.32)  | It's almost like it fell to the right, but it's like its feet kind of moved away from              |
| [08:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=502.16)  | its head.                                                                                          |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=503.16)  | Anyway, turned into a tilt.                                                                        |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=505.0)   | And then if you like a skew X animation is a great way to make something look windblown            |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=509.6)   | or to be used as like anticipation before running away.                                            |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=512.48)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=513.48)  | Like if you think about like the mask or like Wile E. Coyote and how they swing their arms         |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=517.96)  | behind their head and they lift their leg and then they start their run.                           |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=522.44)  | That initial gesture is like they're skewing their body in an anticipation from taking             |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=527.72)  | off and having some speed.                                                                         |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=529.64)  | But anyway, skew Y is similar, but it's applied vertically.                                        |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=532.34)  | So it's good for vertical stretching effects.                                                      |
| [08:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=534.4)   | Like if you were pulling tacky apart or something like that.                                       |
| [08:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=536.68)  | I like the Wile E. Coyote example.                                                                 |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=538.74)  | That's a good one.                                                                                 |
| [09:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=539.74)  | Thanks.                                                                                            |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=540.74)  | So now we're entering 3D transform land.                                                           |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=543.8)   | And 3D transforms introduce a new dimension into the mix, which is the Z axis.                     |
| [09:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=548.66)  | The Z axis can be thought of as forward and backward, toward and away, kind of like the            |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=552.92)  | Z index where you can move items in front of others or behind them.                                |
| [09:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=557.32)  | There are dev tools that actually help to show you what the Z axis of your website looks           |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=561.48)  | like in 3D and it kind of like pulls it out.                                                       |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=563.84)  | It's really cool to see all that.                                                                  |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=565.0)   | So the Z axis can really come in handy when creating 3D animated effects like card flips           |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=569.48)  | or rotating a 3D cube in space.                                                                    |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=572.84)  | And you can make that happen with the rotate 3D function.                                          |
| [09:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=577.04)  | So with rotate 3D, you can rotate the X, Y and Z axis all at the same time.                        |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=581.48)  | And it accepts four values.                                                                        |
| [09:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=583.16)  | There's the X, Y and Z values, and then a rotation value, which can be any angle, degrees,         |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=588.32)  | turns, radians.                                                                                    |
| [09:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=589.72)  | For the X, Y and Z values for these arguments, they can either be positive or negative values      |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=594.64)  | inclusive of negative one to one.                                                                  |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=597.16)  | And they correspond to the axis of rotation.                                                       |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=600.1)   | So you're creating one 3D transform that covers multiple dimensions at once.                       |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=605.72)  | And you're using the X, Y and Z to state how much of those on what axis they're rotating.          |
| [10:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=611.72)  | But it's like one transform.                                                                       |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=613.84)  | It's pretty cool to see it all together.                                                           |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=616.14)  | And you can also break these out into rotate X, rotate Y and rotate Z functions individually.      |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=622.18)  | So you could do like rotate X 30 degrees.                                                          |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=625.26)  | And that's actually equivalent to rotate 3D one comma zero comma zero comma 30 degrees,            |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=631.84)  | because you're just doing one instead of doing them all at the same time.                          |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=634.96)  | And the same goes for the Y and Z values for the second and third arguments of this function       |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=640.32)  | list for rotate 3D.                                                                                |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=641.32)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=642.32)  | That's kind of a tricky one.                                                                       |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=643.32)  | But you did really good when they breaking that down.                                              |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=645.4)   | Like I don't think I've really fully understood that.                                              |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=648.6)   | Yeah, rotate 3D.                                                                                   |
| [10:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=650.64)  | And that the values that the first three that I passed is just sort of saying how much and         |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=654.32)  | then the angle there.                                                                              |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=655.72)  | That's I feel like I've been misusing that for my whole life.                                      |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=658.96)  | Awesome.                                                                                           |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=659.96)  | Thank you for breaking that down for me.                                                           |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=661.28)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [11:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=662.28)  | I didn't realize that until I like dove in because I thought it was kind of like, oh,              |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=665.48)  | like you're rotating these individually, but it's really one transform.                            |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=668.76)  | And you're stating like what the axis is of all of the points of transformation.                   |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=673.88)  | Totally makes sense.                                                                               |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=674.88)  | I've fumbled with that for so many years.                                                          |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=676.52)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [11:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=677.52)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [11:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=678.52)  | I mean, the next one you're about to go into is also tricky.                                       |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=680.6)   | Oh, the next one is super.                                                                         |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=682.56)  | Yeah, very tricky.                                                                                 |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=683.64)  | So this is matrix 3D.                                                                              |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=685.48)  | And this is a four by four matrix.                                                                 |
| [11:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=687.46)  | It's literally 16 values separated by a comma.                                                     |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=690.72)  | And I mentioned earlier that it's the common denominator data type for 3D transforms.              |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=694.96)  | And this is essentially you writing it by hand.                                                    |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=697.96)  | So between the lines of all of those numbers is that it's like, oh, and it's sort of the           |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=701.96)  | value that it's a common denominator is also that it's super low level.                            |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=705.84)  | So you'll need to memorize or map each of the matrix positions so that you know which              |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=710.38)  | one to change if you wanted to change these by hand.                                               |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=712.4)   | Like if it's a matrix of four by four, like the cell at two by two controls something.             |
| [11:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=717.24)  | I don't have it memorized.                                                                         |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=718.9)   | But if you did, you could sort of reach into this matrix by hand and tweak various transforms      |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=724.64)  | this way.                                                                                          |
| [12:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=725.64)  | I've never got very good at it, but I've seen it used in some pretty powerful ways.                |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=729.4)   | Like there's a whole art to interfacing with this matrix 3D and even frameworks like Famo.us.      |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=734.32)  | Do you remember Famo.us?                                                                           |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=735.32)  | Briefly.                                                                                           |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=736.32)  | Like I remember this URL, but I don't remember much about it.                                      |
| [12:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=739.72)  | Yeah, it was like mind blowing when the first iPad came out.                                       |
| [12:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=743.84)  | It was like iPad one or two and someone made this gorgeous 3D 60 frames per second experience      |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=749.48)  | on it all because they tapped directly into matrix 3D.                                             |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=753.46)  | So essentially, yeah, Famo.us leveraged the, what they would quote is nearly direct GPU            |
| [12:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=759.44)  | access that they get from the 3D matrix.                                                           |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=761.92)  | So they were able to create games and highly animated interfaces on super low power hardware.      |
| [12:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=766.82)  | It's amazing, but it is, it's low level.                                                           |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=769.6)   | So it comes at a cost, but it can really have some great results.                                  |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=772.48)  | So it's totally worth an investigation if that sounds interesting, but it's a function.            |
| [12:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=776.64)  | It's a matrix 3D function and accepts 16 numbers.                                                  |
| [13:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=780.68)  | Like I said, comma separated and you can achieve technically more than any of the things that      |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=785.42)  | you can in the declarative syntax, but it comes out a very steep learning curve and                |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=790.52)  | Famo.us is kind of famous for figuring it out, but also not really distilling it easy              |
| [13:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=798.6)   | enough for everyone.                                                                               |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=799.6)   | That was almost their whole value prop is we're going to make matrix 3D available.                 |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=802.32)  | It's available for everyone and it's just a heavy concept.                                         |
| [13:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=806.0)   | So anyway, that's there for you in CSS to directly access and do some powerful things              |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=810.8)   | with if you want.                                                                                  |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=811.8)   | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=812.8)   | So the next 3D transform function is translate 3D.                                                 |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=816.36)  | This is similar to rotate 3D in that you set X, Y, and Z at the same time, but it's a little       |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=821.22)  | bit easier to author because you're setting them directly for each value.                          |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=826.56)  | So with translate 3D, instead of the transform, instead of the rotate, you're doing a translation. |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=834.44)  | So like a placement within the space.                                                              |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=838.14)  | So now instead of the 2D space, you have 3D space.                                                 |
| [14:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=841.68)  | So this allows you to do X, Y, and Z translations all at the same time.                            |
| [14:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=846.7)   | They accept any length unit like pixels or REMS.                                                   |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=851.92)  | There's three arguments that accepts up to three values for X, Y, and Z.                           |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=855.88)  | You could just do X, you could do X and Y, you could do X, Y, and Z.                               |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=858.96)  | So for the X and Y translation values, you could use a percentage, which is cool.                  |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=864.08)  | It'll be a percentage of the parent.                                                               |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=865.48)  | So that's something to keep in mind.                                                               |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=866.88)  | For the Z value, you can't use a percentage, only length values because it doesn't know            |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=870.68)  | what the percentage of Z is.                                                                       |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=872.72)  | I hadn't thought of that.                                                                          |
| [14:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=875.46)  | That's so funny.                                                                                   |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=876.46)  | Yeah, totally.                                                                                     |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=877.46)  | It was like a footnote that I saw and I was like, oh yeah, I guess that makes sense.               |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=881.68)  | So for this transformation, for Translate 3D, your element will move to the top right,             |
| [14:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=887.16)  | bottom left, forward, away from you, which can also appear in it resulting scaled up               |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=893.36)  | or down.                                                                                           |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=894.36)  | Because if it's further away from you, it'll scale down.                                           |
| [14:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=895.76)  | If it's closer to you, it'll scale up.                                                             |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=897.62)  | So that's just a thing to realize when you're doing the Z axis translation and all the other       |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=902.24)  | translations at the same time.                                                                     |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=904.32)  | With Translate 3D, it moves it around the pages.                                                   |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=908.12)  | It's kind of cool to see it and to play with it and to use dev tools and just change those         |
| [15:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=911.42)  | values and see it kind of animate up and back.                                                     |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=914.44)  | But you can also do these with individual values.                                                  |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=916.8)   | Translate X, Translate Y, and Translate Z are all functions that you can use to individually       |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=921.98)  | set the translation value for any of these dimensions.                                             |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=924.84)  | It's a dimension, the X dimension, Y dimension, Z dimension.                                       |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=929.64)  | Totally.                                                                                           |
| [15:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=930.64)  | Dimension is a cool word.                                                                          |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=931.64)  | I like it.                                                                                         |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=932.64)  | I feel like Translate is almost like the first one that you try to, the first 3D tool you          |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=936.36)  | open, you drag the object in the scene left and right and that's sort of translating X             |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=942.4)   | and Y.                                                                                             |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=943.4)   | Very nice.                                                                                         |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=944.4)   | I feel like the rotation is the first one because rotation, you can really see that                |
| [15:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=949.08)  | additional dimension, the 3D dimension, whereas Translate, I don't know, I think it translates     |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=953.84)  | more of X and Y typically, like popping in, coming out, doing the menus.                           |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=957.52)  | It's like enter stage, exit stage.                                                                 |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=959.44)  | Sidebars that kind of come in.                                                                     |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=961.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=962.16)  | And also, I find I reach for Rotate Z all the time, which doesn't feel very intuitive,             |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=967.4)   | but it always gives me the results I want.                                                         |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=969.08)  | So I just constantly reach for it because it's like usually I want to rotate things                |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=973.28)  | and I think I want X or Y, but yeah, those sort of...                                              |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=975.84)  | It does change.                                                                                    |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=977.22)  | That's an important thing to note.                                                                 |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=978.44)  | Like when I was playing around with this, the X and Z are kind of flipped for my expectations,     |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=983.36)  | not in 2D, but in 3D for rotation specifically.                                                    |
| [16:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=986.88)  | Only like for rotation, because with the Translate 3D, it is what I expect.                        |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=990.96)  | But for the Rotate, it kind of flips it because the Z will rotate it like the Rotate 2D would      |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=997.56)  | do.                                                                                                |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=998.56)  | Yes.                                                                                               |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=999.56)  | But then the Rotate X for 3D does it away like a card flip.                                        |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1004.36) | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                     |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1005.36) | So you're holding up a piece of paper in front of you.                                             |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1009.12) | Rotating X is almost like you're flipping the back and front in front of yourself.                 |
| [16:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1013.04) | You're looking at the back, looking at the front and you're flipping it horizontally               |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1015.92) | and Rotate Y is like you're flipping it vertically.                                                |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1019.0)  | And then Rotate Z is if you took two hands and you rotated the paper so it's always flat           |
| [17:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1023.74) | in front of you, which doesn't really make sense until you think about the Z axis.                 |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1028.2)  | I don't think it's very intuitive.                                                                 |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1029.68) | Yeah, anyway, sorry for that little tangent.                                                       |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1032.6)  | Sounds like it's got you too before.                                                               |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1034.24) | Definitely.                                                                                        |
| [17:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1035.24) | Well, the next one on here is Scale 3D and this is shorthand for Scale X and Scale Y.              |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1039.56) | It accepts two values and it accepts numbers.                                                      |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1043.42) | And Scale X is like a squish effect.                                                               |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1046.46) | It's being horizontally squeezed and Scale Y is a squish effect also, but it's if it's             |
| [17:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1051.08) | being vertically squeezed.                                                                         |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1052.72) | And if you're following Disney principles, kind of like Yuno was talking about earlier,            |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1055.6)  | if you Scale X, you should probably Scale Y up, right?                                             |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1060.08) | The volume of the element that you're squeezing needs to go somewhere.                             |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1063.72) | So if you're squeezing it horizontally, it's going to ooze out the top and the bottom.             |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1067.0)  | And then if you squeeze it vertically, it's going to become wider and you get that squishy         |
| [17:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1070.8)  | and squashy effect and you do that with Scale 3D.                                                  |
| [17:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1073.64) | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1074.64) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1075.64) | So I'm going to put Disney principles into this.                                                   |
| [17:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1077.32) | That's a good reminder.                                                                            |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1078.72) | I love the Disney animation principles.                                                            |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1080.36) | Like I got to review those.                                                                        |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1081.36) | Oh, same.                                                                                          |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1082.36) | They're amazing.                                                                                   |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1083.36) | There should be like a Disney animation principles for web design course.                          |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1087.44) | This is how ideas get started.                                                                     |
| [18:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1091.24) | Season three.                                                                                      |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1092.24) | Okay.                                                                                              |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1093.24) | So I want to talk about perspective next.                                                          |
| [18:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1095.44) | Perspective is something that you could include within the transform property as another function. |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1101.24) | But there's also perspective origin, which is a separate property that you would set               |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1104.6)  | in your CSS.                                                                                       |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1105.6)  | So that's important.                                                                               |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1106.6)  | Just like transform origin, perspective origin is like critical in how these things look           |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1111.04) | and work and feel.                                                                                 |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1112.6)  | So with perspective, just imagine, take a step back, close your eyes.                              |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1118.44) | Remember art class where you pick like a perspective point on a piece of paper and then you would  |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1124.4)  | draw lines like grid lines that go from the edge of your paper to the perspective point.           |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1128.88) | And then you would draw like a city based on the perspective grid lines.                           |
| [18:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1131.68) | So you'd have your horizon line and the perspective point and you would do like that whole, yeah,  |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1136.8)  | that's a classic.                                                                                  |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1137.8)  | This is perspective and you can pick that point in CSS too.                                        |
| [19:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1142.04) | And that is where you use perspective origin and perspective function.                             |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1145.12) | So perspective function sets the distance between the user and the Z equals zero plane,            |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1150.88) | which is the point at which everything appears in a 2D view to the screen.                         |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1154.6)  | So you can make the perspective appear closer with a positive value, perspective one, two,         |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1160.72) | one point five, 10 or a negative value to make it appear further away, like perspective            |
| [19:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1166.52) | and then in parentheses, zero point five.                                                          |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1168.56) | And you can use any length value here.                                                             |
| [19:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1170.46) | So you would actually have to use a value like five REMS, 18 pixels, things like that.             |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1176.48) | I don't know why I said it without four.                                                           |
| [19:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1178.04) | This needs a unit.                                                                                 |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1179.96) | So you could set the perspective with any length value.                                            |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1182.84) | And then there's the perspective origin properties.                                                |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1184.68) | This is outside the transform property.                                                            |
| [19:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1187.28) | Here you set this perspective origin where wherever you are in that 2D plane in art class,         |
| [19:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1193.6)  | you know, you can make it instead of the very center point in your paper, you could do the         |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1197.24) | top left or top right or left center, things like that.                                            |
| [20:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1201.2)  | Nice.                                                                                              |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1202.2)  | Another way to think of this is like a 3D camera.                                                  |
| [20:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1203.56) | So this is like where the origin point is, not just the amount of distortion and perspective.      |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1210.28) | And the perspective function is the amount of distortion and perspective origin is the             |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1213.84) | location of the perspective.                                                                       |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1216.64) | So this accepts a single value for both X and Y position as a shorthand or two values              |
| [20:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1222.4)  | set them separately.                                                                               |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1223.56) | The default is center or 50 percent, 50 percent.                                                   |
| [20:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1227.28) | And you can also use keywords like top right, bottom left, center.                                 |
| [20:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1231.12) | So yeah, you can set something like center top and have a center top perspective.                  |
| [20:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1236.04) | Excellent breakdown.                                                                               |
| [20:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1237.28) | Perspective is something I set very often when I'm doing things in 3D space because                |
| [20:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1241.56) | it can give a depth.                                                                               |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1242.92) | Yeah, you're essentially sort of like almost changing like this focal length to it.                |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1246.4)  | It has so many cool effects, but I do like to think of it as a camera.                             |
| [20:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1250.12) | I think that's one of the best.                                                                    |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1251.4)  | If you're familiar with cameras, it can make a really good metaphor.                               |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1255.04) | I think of it like art class city drawings.                                                        |
| [20:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1256.96) | Yeah, I really liked the art class one too.                                                        |
| [20:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1259.16) | I'm less technically advanced with filmography.                                                    |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1263.32) | No worries.                                                                                        |
| [21:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1264.32) | I definitely come from those roots where you put the dot on the page and drew your lines           |
| [21:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1268.08) | and I think pictures turn out cool that way.                                                       |
| [21:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1270.6)  | And yeah, it was really nice to think about CSS that way.                                          |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1272.96) | I wonder if we can make DevTools sort of reflect that mentality a little bit.                      |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1277.08) | That would be cool.                                                                                |
| [21:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1278.08) | All right, let's talk about transform style.                                                       |
| [21:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1280.8)  | So this isn't a value that you pass into the transform property.                                   |
| [21:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1284.36) | This lives alongside of it and it accepts two different strings.                                   |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1288.08) | It accepts flat and preserve 3D.                                                                   |
| [21:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1291.16) | And what it does is it creates a stacking context and a containing block while also                |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1295.58) | establishing a 3D render context for children.                                                     |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1299.24) | So like, well, a great trick can be to create a 3D context inside of another 3D context,           |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1303.84) | like a flap on a box in a 3D space.                                                                |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1306.16) | So if you think about a box that's in another 3D scene, if I was to set preserve 3D and            |
| [21:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1312.0)  | it had a child that was this flap, the flap would now scale and rotate as if it's in the           |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1318.64) | world of that box.                                                                                 |
| [22:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1321.16) | So it's a little bit of an inception example there, but I liked the idea of like a flap            |
| [22:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1325.26) | being relative to the box and then the box relative to a world.                                    |
| [22:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1329.68) | They're two different preserve 3D contexts.                                                        |
| [22:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1332.16) | They're two different transform styles.                                                            |
| [22:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1334.76) | There's also another really interesting use case here.                                             |
| [22:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1337.4)  | Let's say you want to put a pseudo element behind another element and it's a sibling,              |
| [22:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1343.04) | or let's say you just want to put siblings behind every other sibling.                             |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1346.48) | An interesting way to do this is on a parent container to set the transform style to preserve      |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1350.72) | 3D, which now enables a Z index space, and so you can set a transform, a translate Z,              |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1358.2)  | negative one pixel on something and it will be behind all the other children layers.               |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1363.72) | Because you preserved 3D, you created a context for 3D rendering for children and you set          |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1368.4)  | one kind of behind the others.                                                                     |
| [22:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1370.14) | Like literally it's behind them in a 3D space.                                                     |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1374.4)  | So yeah, transform style, it's a little tricky, has some kind of other cool use cases, but         |
| [22:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1379.2)  | hopefully that gave you a decent breakdown.                                                        |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1380.92) | Yeah, I hadn't really thought about how to use this before, but that was a good overview.          |
| [23:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1387.3)  | So another property that you'll probably find very useful but might not have really thought        |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1391.4)  | about much before is back face visibility.                                                         |
| [23:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1394.3)  | So in a 3D space, things have a front and a back and on the web, the back is usually               |
| [23:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1399.04) | just a transparent background.                                                                     |
| [23:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1401.18) | So it could kind of be funky.                                                                      |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1402.84) | So back face visibility is an optimization opportunity where if you know you'll never              |
| [23:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1407.4)  | see an element from the back, the renderer can skip that work or you can explicitly state          |
| [23:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1412.64) | that the back will be seen.                                                                        |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1414.44) | And this property accepts the values of visible or hidden.                                         |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1419.24) | If you're doing something like a card flip animation with content and elements of both             |
| [23:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1422.88) | sides, like say you have like a front element and a back element and they have a class of          |
| [23:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1427.56) | front and back, you'll probably want to set back face visibility hidden.                           |
| [23:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1431.92) | So when you do flip it, this will be on the front element.                                         |
| [23:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1435.68) | So when you flip it, you'll see the back element and it doesn't overlap with the back of the       |
| [24:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1440.32) | first element and cause like weird rendering issues.                                               |
| [24:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1443.22) | So this can definitely be useful when you're trying to have anything either visible or             |
| [24:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1448.34) | hidden and show other elements or not.                                                             |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1451.68) | But it's really useful if you're doing flip effects, like you'll definitely be using back          |
| [24:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1455.44) | face visibility.                                                                                   |
| [24:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1456.44) | Yeah, especially if you're doing like text.                                                        |
| [24:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1458.46) | So if you've rotated any text in 3D, like let's say you do a rotate Y, you're sort of              |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1463.44) | like flipping it vertically.                                                                       |
| [24:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1465.24) | The text will all be backwards when you look at the back of the card, right?                       |
| [24:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1468.36) | You're sort of like seeing through it, like you described a transparency effect, but yeah,         |
| [24:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1472.72) | everything's illegible and you're like, well, that's not useful.                                   |
| [24:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1475.52) | So I'll set back face visibility to hidden and now no one will have to see the weird               |
| [24:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1480.8)  | mistake of text.                                                                                   |
| [24:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1481.8)  | The front from the back.                                                                           |
| [24:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1483.36) | Yep.                                                                                               |
| [24:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1484.36) | And okay, so as we're kind of closing out here, we've got an individual transform properties.      |
| [24:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1489.1)  | So these are specced and they only mostly have Firefox support, but they allow, instead            |
| [24:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1495.08) | of using the transform colon and then specifying a whole bunch of transform list, this lets        |
| [25:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1500.44) | you transform individual properties just as a one-off.                                             |
| [25:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1505.84) | So you don't have to manage this transforms list.                                                  |
| [25:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1508.14) | And then it's also kind of interesting is because it takes out the concept of order,               |
| [25:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1512.92) | right?                                                                                             |
| [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1513.92) | So now that you're not saying translate first and then rotate, you're just saying in a transform   |
| [25:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1519.68) | property, let's see, like translate.                                                               |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1522.84) | Well, yeah, anyway, so you do these individually.                                                  |
| [25:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1525.72) | You don't have to worry about order because now you're letting CSS sort of run its natural         |
| [25:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1530.04) | order.                                                                                             |
| [25:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1531.04) | It's going to kind of create an order for you, but that's also why this is controversial           |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1533.52) | is like not everyone wants the browser to create the order for them.                               |
| [25:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1537.48) | They sometimes like managing the order.                                                            |
| [25:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1539.64) | So anyway, these are translate, scale and rotate.                                                  |
| [25:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1541.84) | This would literally be in your CSS.                                                               |
| [25:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1543.24) | You'd say translate colon and you'd pass some values or scale colon and pass some values           |
| [25:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1547.16) | instead of putting them in that transform.                                                         |
| [25:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1549.44) | I feel like the need for this is mostly pacified with custom properties today because you can      |
| [25:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1554.2)  | say transform colon, translate, rotate, scale, and you can sort of set your order.                 |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1560.0)  | And then you can just go change a custom property somewhere else and it would maintain the order.  |
| [26:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1564.24) | So I don't know, it's a little controversial.                                                      |
| [26:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1566.2)  | I have wanted to reach for this in the past though, because maybe all I want to do is              |
| [26:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1569.72) | translate X and like, why do I have to manage this big long transform list when I'm just           |
| [26:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1574.44) | targeting this one transform property?                                                             |
| [26:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1576.06) | So I see value on both sides, but I did want to mention that individual transform properties       |
| [26:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1581.4)  | are specced and they are in Firefox and you can go prototype with them today and they'll           |
| [26:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1585.08) | probably eventually land in your browser.                                                          |
| [26:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1586.92) | Yeah, that's a good point.                                                                         |
| [26:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1588.28) | I think the biggest use case for this is like if you have your transform list and then you         |
| [26:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1591.12) | just want to make like one slight adjustment and you don't want to have to like copy and           |
| [26:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1593.6)  | paste that and manage the rest of the list.                                                        |
| [26:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1595.76) | But with custom properties, I mean, because this is experimental anyway, anywhere that             |
| [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1599.2)  | supports this also supports custom properties.                                                     |
| [26:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1601.84) | So well, it's in Firefox, so it's cool to play with it.                                            |
| [26:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1605.68) | And I see the utility of having these individual functions, maybe just for legibility, things      |
| [26:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1611.32) | like that.                                                                                         |
| [26:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1612.32) | Yeah, I could see this being useful, but I think that the problems it solves, as you               |
| [26:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1617.44) | mentioned, are solved in other ways currently.                                                     |
| [27:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1619.52) | Yeah, it makes sense why no one is in a rush to kind of fulfill these, especially with             |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1624.12) | the order issues.                                                                                  |
| [27:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1625.12) | I think a lot of implementers are like, how does this affect the order?                            |
| [27:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1628.36) | And they kind of get caught up in that, but it's in the spec.                                      |
| [27:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1630.44) | So the order's there.                                                                              |
| [27:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1632.24) | And the last thing to share about transforms is like, I can't talk about transforms without        |
| [27:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1636.72) | talking about transitioning transforms.                                                            |
| [27:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1639.66) | So the transition property on CSS, you could say transition colon transform 0.3 seconds.           |
| [27:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1645.44) | I put this in my CSS all over the place because I'm often using transforms to manage some          |
| [27:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1650.24) | state and some interactions.                                                                       |
| [27:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1652.52) | And I want to see the browser animate between those, right?                                        |
| [27:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1655.24) | You want to see it move to the left, not just snap over to the left in a translate.                |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1659.76) | And so yeah, I'm just sharing my typical standard prototype style that I do is transition colon    |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1664.76) | transform 0.3 seconds.                                                                             |
| [27:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1666.08) | And that'll default with an ease.                                                                  |
| [27:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1668.52) | And that's just where I start.                                                                     |
| [27:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1669.58) | So I'll later go in and change the timing and the animation timing functions and stuff             |
| [27:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1673.96) | later.                                                                                             |
| [27:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1674.96) | But when I'm just prototyping with transform, try using that transition transform style            |
| [27:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1679.16) | and see if it gives you a little boost in the way that your interface feels.                       |
| [28:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1683.2)  | Well, it also makes it a lot easier to have users understand what just happened.                   |
| [28:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1687.44) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                          |
| [28:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1688.44) | They want to see the motion from one state to another rather than just like popping into           |
| [28:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1692.56) | the second state.                                                                                  |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1693.56) | So I think this is not just like a nice add on.                                                    |
| [28:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1695.52) | It's critical for user experience to have some kind of feedback for where something                |
| [28:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1700.32) | moves.                                                                                             |
| [28:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1701.32) | Totally.                                                                                           |
| [28:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1702.32) | No one likes a jarring snapping experience.                                                        |
| [28:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1703.36) | They want to see the piece of paper kind of move across the screen.                                |
| [28:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1706.68) | And the last note here is I put this inside of a prefers motion media query.                       |
| [28:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1709.92) | So anytime I'm like, it's transition on a transform, I'm like, that's very likely motion.          |
| [28:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1715.62) | And so I'll put that behind a prefers motion media query.                                          |
| [28:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1718.42) | And that's it for the transition style there.                                                      |
| [28:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1720.92) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [28:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1721.92) | Another thing you can do is also in the prefers reduced motion media query, do something like      |
| [28:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1726.16) | a slower transform.                                                                                |
| [28:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1727.88) | So it's less jarring.                                                                              |
| [28:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1729.92) | But it still shows the motion from one state to another.                                           |
| [28:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1733.2)  | You don't want it to be too slow because then that's also a worse user experience.                 |
| [28:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1737.36) | But lots of things to experiment with.                                                             |
| [28:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1738.8)  | And I also think like with the preference media queries, we're still exploring what                |
| [29:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1742.9)  | users prefer the most.                                                                             |
| [29:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1745.2)  | What users who prefer reduced motion want.                                                         |
| [29:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1748.02) | So it's somewhere in between all those things.                                                     |
| [29:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1750.56) | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| [29:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1751.56) | I like to crossfade.                                                                               |
| [29:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1752.56) | So like I'll transition opacity inside of a prefers reduced motion media query, for example.       |
| [29:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1757.12) | But yeah, I agree.                                                                                 |
| [29:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1758.12) | There's a lot to learn here.                                                                       |
| [29:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1759.12) | That's a good solution.                                                                            |
| [29:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1760.56) | So yeah, thank you for joining us on our journey through transforms that this show is a lot        |
| [29:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1765.1)  | of fun to put together.                                                                            |
| [29:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lOl1RG3deF4JbuJQfQffd?&t=1766.1)  | Yeah.                                                                                              |
