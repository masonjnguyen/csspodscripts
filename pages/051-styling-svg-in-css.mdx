| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=17.4)    | One thing I love to do is use CSS to style inline SVG elements.                                     |
| [00:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=21.68)   | SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and because they are vectors and built out of               |
| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=26.48)   | code, you can use CSS to gain access to parts of that SVG.                                          |
| [00:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=31.56)   | And from there you can do all sorts of things from adjusting color values to adding animations      |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=36.4)    | to entrance and other effects.                                                                      |
| [00:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=38.88)   | Styling SVG with CSS can be really fun and introduce a lot of unique interactions on                |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=43.48)   | the web.                                                                                            |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=44.48)   | Drung agree.                                                                                        |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=45.68)   | I'm a big fan of SVG in my interfaces.                                                              |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=48.1)    | It can be so beautiful in so many ways.                                                             |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=50.62)   | It's a real art to folks who can sit down and draw with SVG code from scratch too.                  |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=54.48)   | I've practiced it like twice in my career and very little has stuck, but some of it                 |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=59.0)    | has stuck and it can be truly an amazing back pocket interface tool for unique and minimal          |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=63.56)   | interface additions.                                                                                |
| [01:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=64.56)   | Yeah, SVG is made a bunch of elements including but not limited to things like circle, ellipse,     |
| [01:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=70.36)   | line, path, polygon, polyline, rect, text, text path, t-ref, t-span.                                |
| [01:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=77.24)   | You can also put media within SVG elements so you can get really creative and complex               |
| [01:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=81.44)   | when building with SVGs.                                                                            |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=84.28)   | And there's a lot of different ways to do so.                                                       |
| [01:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=86.24)   | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| [01:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=87.24)   | All right, let's go over a couple different ways that you can put SVG into your page.               |
| [01:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=90.68)   | We have inline and an image tag.                                                                    |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=93.4)    | And when you use an image tag, you can put styles directly in the image itself.                     |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=97.68)   | So this would be like a SVG file that you have on your hard drive or up on your server.             |
| [01:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=101.18)  | And you can request that image as like a source or as a background source.                          |
| [01:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=105.48)  | And when you do it this way, it will scale perfectly still just like it would normally.             |
| [01:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=109.24)  | An SVG in an image tag, like if you did source equals home.svg can be cached, which is really       |
| [01:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=115.04)  | nice, but it can't be styled with external page CSS.                                                |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=118.28)  | It can only be styled with that CSS that came inside of it.                                         |
| [02:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=121.32)  | Also if you use a background image and you use a URL function, you can cache that image             |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=125.14)  | source again like home.svg, but it also can't be styled with page CSS.                              |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=130.24)  | There's another way that you can use it too.                                                        |
| [02:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=131.64)  | So instead of URL going home.svg directly, you can encode it.                                       |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=135.32)  | And this can be, I don't know, depending on your scenarios can be a nice way to do it.              |
| [02:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=138.48)  | This way the SVG gets turned into a long string, like a URL encoded data set.                       |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=143.44)  | And you can put that in your CSS as the URL.                                                        |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=145.66)  | It gets cached with the style sheet, but it can cause a lot of bloat.                               |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=148.62)  | Like if you have a lot of these base 64 or URL encoded SVGs, they can get really big                |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=153.54)  | in your styles.                                                                                     |
| [02:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=154.54)  | So be careful of that.                                                                              |
| [02:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=155.54)  | They also can't be styled with page CSS either.                                                     |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=157.88)  | And implementation is kind of tricky.                                                               |
| [02:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=159.32)  | You have to do like URL, open parentheses, start a string, data, colon, image, slash,               |
| [02:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=164.52)  | SVG plus XML, semi-colon, UTF-8, comma, and then all your SVG information.                          |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=170.2)   | And it's even trickier than that.                                                                   |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=171.4)   | Like you can't have certain characters in there.                                                    |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=173.2)   | So you're going to have to run it through a certain scrubber or write some, anyway,                 |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=177.46)  | it's just really hard.                                                                              |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=178.46)  | So it's worth noting that you can put SVG encoded data into an image source tag too.                |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=182.16)  | Like you can have image source equals and then specify it, but I don't highly recommend             |
| [03:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=186.02)  | these things unless you've got a good reason to do them.                                            |
| [03:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=188.4)   | So that was referencing image as like a separate tag or as like an object as a separate file.       |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=193.28)  | Let's talk about inline SVG.                                                                        |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=194.76)  | So this would be like markup.                                                                       |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=195.96)  | So comparing inline SVG to file referencing has the advantage of being styled from page             |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=200.56)  | CSS.                                                                                                |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=201.56)  | So this is a huge advantage not to be taken lightly.                                                |
| [03:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=203.68)  | I mentioned earlier the art of handwriting SVG, and that's because your inline SVG doesn't          |
| [03:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=207.86)  | need to come from Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, or some other design tool, though admittedly    |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=212.3)   | that's where most of it, my work experience comes with SVG.                                         |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=215.56)  | You could write your own circles or lines and by authoring it by hand, you can better               |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=219.26)  | plan animations and orchestrate cooler interactions.                                                |
| [03:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=222.54)  | So I've seen some really cool things like with the form and someone just had a custom               |
| [03:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=225.84)  | SVG that as they were typing it into an input, they animated the line stroke on an SVG.             |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=230.64)  | It's just really cool.                                                                              |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=231.64)  | It's like this two lines of code, just tons of really neat interaction.                             |
| [03:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=234.96)  | Or you can copy it from Illustrator and paste it into a document file and then you'll have          |
| [04:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=239.84)  | your SVG code and you just have to like take out like a little header tag.                          |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=243.84)  | That's pretty much what my next section talks about.                                                |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=245.7)   | It's like, but a lot of the time I create my inline SVG a few ways.                                 |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=249.64)  | Like I get it from somebody else.                                                                   |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=251.04)  | So let's say something got exported from a tool like a home icon.                                   |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=253.96)  | I'll open the SVG file into text editor and take out things that are clearly junk by just           |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=258.36)  | highlighting them and deleting them.                                                                |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=259.76)  | So this is things like, I don't know, comments or just, I don't know, you'll see there's            |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=263.12)  | just a bunch of junk in there.                                                                      |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=264.5)   | Or I'll go to svgomg.com, which is made by Jake Archibald, one of our coworkers and let             |
| [04:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=268.42)  | it try and take out the junk.                                                                       |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=269.42)  | And it does a good job.                                                                             |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=270.54)  | The goal here is to minimize the amount of SVG markup I need to juggle because it's markup,         |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=274.84)  | right?                                                                                              |
| [04:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=275.84)  | And the default you usually get from a design tool is full of bloat.                                |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=278.28)  | I mean full of bloat, three to four times bigger than it needs to be.                               |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=282.04)  | So when I open these up, I look for inline styles.                                                  |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=284.46)  | I take them out and for the SVG tag itself in my HTML, I try to have it only be the viewbox,        |
| [04:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=289.54)  | width and height, and probably an aria-hidden true attribute because usually SVG icons are          |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=294.3)   | visual assistants and they're not necessarily content.                                              |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=297.36)  | So SVG that's been cleaned and tailored like this ensures that I have a clean base set              |
| [05:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=301.64)  | of vectors to style with from my CSS.                                                               |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=304.52)  | That's the whole goal is with a clean SVG markup.                                                   |
| [05:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=306.72)  | I can put it into HTML, Jade or pug, 11D as a JavaScript export or whatever.                        |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=312.4)   | Once it's clean SVG, it's very portable and can be used in lots of different ways.                  |
| [05:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=316.36)  | So whatever way you want to pass around the code, it's up to you.                                   |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=318.54)  | But I did want to mention here, it's very much worth your time cleaning up SVG files                |
| [05:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=322.5)   | before trying to work with them inline.                                                             |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=324.56)  | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                   |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=325.56)  | And you might even want to go through and rename the classes because they're pretty                 |
| [05:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=329.14)  | like abstract when you're copying and pasting them for one of these tools.                          |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=332.56)  | Yeah, there's also lots of IDs.                                                                     |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=334.28)  | There's just tons of like, yeah, you can see design tool junk is just marked up all over            |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=337.88)  | there for them.                                                                                     |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=338.88)  | And anyway, yeah, I could call.                                                                     |
| [05:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=340.92)  | I do have a warning here that some files are too hard to clean.                                     |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=344.16)  | They're full of transforms on path data or have funky view boxes.                                   |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=348.02)  | So the techniques that we just mentioned to kind of clean up, they might be too difficult.          |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=353.16)  | Or and then like, here's a second warning.                                                          |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=354.88)  | You might remove stuff accidentally like fill equals none and have a really funny looking           |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=358.82)  | icon at the end that looks all wrong.                                                               |
| [06:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=361.26)  | And so you'll need to decide where you want those styles to be and if it's in your CSS,             |
| [06:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=364.98)  | bring fill none and friends with you into your style so that you can make sure that                 |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=369.02)  | your icon looks right when it gets rendered.                                                        |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=371.12)  | Okay, so then we have another thing with inline SVG and it's this use tag.                          |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=375.24)  | And the use tag is a rad trick to prevent repeating lots of inline SVG on the page.                 |
| [06:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=379.42)  | So you could be a source of markup bloat, right?                                                    |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=382.12)  | You could have like the same arrow icon is used on a list.                                          |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=385.32)  | Then all of a sudden you have 50 SVG arrows inline and it's just kind of getting a lot.             |
| [06:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=390.08)  | So a trick could be to define your SVG path information as a symbol inside of a hidden              |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=394.32)  | SVG.                                                                                                |
| [06:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=395.32)  | You give each symbol an ID and then this handy dandy use tag can point to it and have its           |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=399.84)  | contents magically swapped for the symbols path data.                                               |
| [06:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=402.92)  | Create one icon to rule them all essentially.                                                       |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=405.36)  | And it's also neat because you can alter the view box, height, width, colors, et cetera,            |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=409.48)  | with the use element path data as if it was inline SVG right there this whole time.                 |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=413.6)   | So it's like you define this shape, this reusable set of vectors, and then you go use that home     |
| [06:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=418.5)   | icon in 20 different colorful, interactive different ways.                                          |
| [07:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=422.56)  | And it's all just the same source vector.                                                           |
| [07:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=424.98)  | That's a really cool trick.                                                                         |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=426.16)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=427.16)  | I actually, when I was working at IBM, built an entire icon library that hinged on use              |
| [07:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=432.8)   | and it was a lot more performant and really nice to use for our pages.                              |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=438.68)  | Especially when you have like shared template files because you do need to include the use          |
| [07:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=444.8)   | template SVG in your app and then you can kind of go wild with it without taking up                 |
| [07:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=450.08)  | more space.                                                                                         |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=451.08)  | Yeah, it is a really neat trick.                                                                    |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=452.8)   | All right.                                                                                          |
| [07:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=453.8)   | So that's SVG as images or as inline markup and how to get inline markup into your page             |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=458.48)  | in a way that CSS won't have issues styling it.                                                     |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=460.8)   | So Yuna, can you tell us about styling inline SVG with CSS?                                         |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=464.64)  | What do we got?                                                                                     |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=465.64)  | Well, there's a lot of ways to do it.                                                               |
| [07:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=466.64)  | So let's start with color.                                                                          |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=468.82)  | Using fill to apply color is a really clear way to style SVG.                                       |
| [07:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=475.56)  | I feel like this is used with icons a lot.                                                          |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=477.84)  | Again with use, you could still have control over the contents of that element.                     |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=484.32)  | And I've also seen a lot of sites that have different theme colors, even randomized theme           |
| [08:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=488.64)  | colors that will use fill to create styles across their SVGs as well as their page.                 |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=493.44)  | So that's really cool.                                                                              |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=495.06)  | But again, you have to have some way to grab the SVG so you can only really do this with            |
| [08:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=499.2)   | inline SVGs and you're going to need some kind of class name on the elements that you're            |
| [08:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=504.64)  | trying to apply this to.                                                                            |
| [08:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=505.64)  | So you can apply it to like circle, ellipse, rect, etc.                                             |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=508.56)  | Scope your changes to just that element.                                                            |
| [08:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=510.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=511.64)  | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                      |
| [08:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=512.64)  | So there is a fill property, but there's also a fill rule and fill opacity.                         |
| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=516.92)  | Fill rule is how you fill something.                                                                |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=519.62)  | So imagine this.                                                                                    |
| [08:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=521.72)  | Imagine you have a star that you're drawing, like a five point star, and you're drawing             |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=526.72)  | it without lifting your pen from the paper.                                                         |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=529.36)  | So as you're drawing it, you kind of like go like up and then make like a little triangle           |
| [08:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=532.74)  | then over to the left corner, over to the right corner and down.                                    |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=536.24)  | So now you have the star, you sort of have like this piece in the middle that intersects            |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=541.12)  | all the other points.                                                                               |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=542.12)  | You kind of have like this cut out piece and you can use a fill rule to specify how you             |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=547.7)   | actually want to style this.                                                                        |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=550.14)  | Do you want to just fill in the corners and have that inside piece left unfilled or do              |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=558.48)  | you want to fill the entire star?                                                                   |
| [09:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=561.0)   | So all together, ignore there's cut lines there.                                                    |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=563.56)  | So there are two values here for the fill rule.                                                     |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=565.76)  | It's non-zero, which fill the entire star.                                                          |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=568.3)   | And there's even odd, which would determine there's a cutout inside of it and just fill             |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=573.4)   | the points, the corners of the star.                                                                |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=576.06)  | So you could kind of, this is important too if you're playing with like targets or any              |
| [09:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=580.32)  | sort of SVGs that have paths within paths, I guess.                                                 |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=585.56)  | But back to speaking of color for SVG that contains images, you can also use color profile          |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=591.04)  | and color rendering.                                                                                |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=592.04)  | Oh, there's also fill opacity.                                                                      |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=593.04)  | I mentioned that, but it's opacity for fill.                                                        |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=596.86)  | So lots of different ways to work with fill and color.                                              |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=600.28)  | And at the end of the episode, I'll share a hack for how to change the color of SVG                 |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=604.08)  | that's inserted as an image or background image.                                                    |
| [10:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=606.2)   | Not necessarily have to be in line.                                                                 |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=608.42)  | That is true.                                                                                       |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=609.42)  | There are some cool tricks there, huh?                                                              |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=610.68)  | One of my favorite tricks with filling and SVG colors is to use a fixed background gradient.        |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=616.6)   | So that way all your icons are somehow magically filled as a group instead of individually.         |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=623.82)  | So if you can imagine like cyan to pink from top to bottom, going from the top of the page          |
| [10:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=627.56)  | to the bottom of the page, going across all your icons like they're a mask into that window.        |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=631.6)   | I think I've said that on the show before.                                                          |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=633.0)   | I just love that technique.                                                                         |
| [10:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=634.0)   | It's so cool.                                                                                       |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=635.0)   | Yeah, very interesting.                                                                             |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=636.0)   | Very cool technique.                                                                                |
| [10:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=637.0)   | All right.                                                                                          |
| [10:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=638.0)   | Let's talk about SVG text and effects, right?                                                       |
| [10:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=640.72)  | So we have a text element that can go inside of SVG and it's bound to that SVG viewport.            |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=646.6)   | And then we have this different types of text rendering.                                            |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=649.32)  | So okay, so just because you can put text inside of SVG, it's like, well, what happens              |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=652.44)  | with wrapping and stuff, right?                                                                     |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=654.28)  | Does it just continue out of the viewport?                                                          |
| [10:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=655.68)  | Are we going to get CSS is awesome all over again and a new SVG is awesome meme?                    |
| [11:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=660.48)  | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| [11:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=661.48)  | It turns out there's ways to handle it.                                                             |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=663.32)  | So if you put text in there, it's pre-formatted with limited line wrapping by default.              |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=667.8)   | This is like manually managing your line breaks with pre and pre line breaks.                       |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=671.66)  | You can't use a BR inside of a text element, for example.                                           |
| [11:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=674.96)  | So you could, you know, you have line breaks in it by default, but they're manual.                  |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=679.88)  | You have auto wrapped if you specify the inline size property on the text element and give          |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=684.32)  | it a length.                                                                                        |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=685.32)  | So if you do want auto wrapping in SVG, you can do it with this inline size property and            |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=689.48)  | you could give it a width of like 20 characters and now it would wrap it as soon as the width       |
| [11:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=694.8)   | got longer than 20 characters.                                                                      |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=696.68)  | Pretty neat.                                                                                        |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=697.68)  | Okay.                                                                                               |
| [11:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=698.68)  | And then there's also text on a path.                                                               |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=699.68)  | So you can do this by wrapping the text inside the text element with a text path element            |
| [11:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=703.88)  | that points to some path data.                                                                      |
| [11:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=706.4)   | And it is just that simple.                                                                         |
| [11:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=708.24)  | You can make a little curvy path, make a text element, wrap that text inside of there and           |
| [11:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=712.46)  | point to that.                                                                                      |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=713.46)  | And it's just curvy text.                                                                           |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=714.46)  | It looks really cool.                                                                               |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=715.46)  | This is so trendy right now with like all the arches in design.                                     |
| [11:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=718.28)  | I see arches everywhere and just the curvy text above the arch.                                     |
| [12:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=722.28)  | It's like the hipster thing to do and I just think of this all the time.                            |
| [12:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=726.96)  | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=727.96)  | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| [12:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=728.96)  | I'm down with it.                                                                                   |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=729.96)  | It's kind of whimsical.                                                                             |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=730.96)  | It can bring a lot of whimsy.                                                                       |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=731.96)  | Whimsy is, can you say whimsy?                                                                      |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=732.96)  | It brings whimsy to something.                                                                      |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=734.32)  | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                   |
| [12:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=735.32)  | I definitely call it whimsical.                                                                     |
| [12:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=737.32)  | Awesome.                                                                                            |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=738.32)  | And then there's also this, there's not as great support, but you can do text with shape            |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=741.26)  | inside and shape subtract inside of SVG where you can specify CSS basic shapes.                     |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=746.32)  | See episode 39 for more information about CSS shapes.                                               |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=749.18)  | But this would be like text style shape dash inside colon circle, 120 pixels at center,             |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=755.2)   | center or 150.                                                                                      |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=756.76)  | Basically define these different shapes and have your text render within them.                      |
| [12:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=760.12)  | So text inside of SVG can do some pretty cool stuff.                                                |
| [12:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=763.56)  | There's also alignments.                                                                            |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=764.56)  | So you can align like your baseline and baseline shift in your text attributes.                     |
| [12:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=768.06)  | This defines how your object should align vertically to its parent.                                 |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=771.18)  | So this allows you to do things like draw text in the middle of a line or on top or                 |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=774.78)  | below a line.                                                                                       |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=775.78)  | So it's kind of, you know, like on the web, we're sort of always on a baseline, but this            |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=779.62)  | allows you to shift your text to explicitly hang underneath or be above.                            |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=783.8)   | So it's kind of cool.                                                                               |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=784.8)   | It takes values like auto top, center, bottom, middle, baseline, before edge, text, bottom,         |
| [13:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=789.32)  | central, not to be confused with middle, I've re-listed text before edge, after edge, text          |
| [13:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=794.2)   | top text after edge, ideographic, alphabetic, hanging and mathematical.                             |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=800.4)   | So there's a lot of different ways to align your text in SVG and text anchor is another             |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=805.08)  | attribute for horizontal alignment, which is why it has values like start, middle and               |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=810.08)  | end.                                                                                                |
| [13:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=811.08)  | So horizontal alignment isn't as exciting in SVG, but holy that vertical alignment,                 |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=816.16)  | that was a lot of options.                                                                          |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=817.16)  | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                   |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=818.16)  | I mean, this reminds me of our text show where we went through like a thousand different            |
| [13:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=823.24)  | ways to get text glyphs and the defaults that exist there.                                          |
| [13:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=828.36)  | Next we have stroke and you can do all sorts of things with stroke in SVG.                          |
| [13:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=831.94)  | The most common or basic thing is applying color with the stroke property.                          |
| [13:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=835.84)  | So stroke accepts a color value or an image value, like a gradient.                                 |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=840.12)  | You could do a gradient stroke or you could do, I don't know, some kind of textured stroke.         |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=845.12)  | You could do like a marble texture stroke.                                                          |
| [14:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=848.02)  | So there's also not just the stroke property, there's also stroke dash array, and this defines      |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=852.78)  | a pattern of dashes and gaps used to paint the stroke.                                              |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=856.92)  | So for example, if you set stroke dash array to four, that would mean you want evenly spaced        |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=862.68)  | four on, four off stroke.                                                                           |
| [14:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=866.0)   | With stroke dash array colon four space one, you'd have four on and one off.                        |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=870.84)  | So be tighter.                                                                                      |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=871.84)  | You'd have like four, say you have like a black stroke around it, you'd have like four              |
| [14:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=876.6)   | to one on to off spacing between.                                                                   |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=879.48)  | You could also set stroke dash array to something like a thousand and this would cover the entire   |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=884.72)  | area and you can then use that for things that we'll talk about later, little tips and              |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=889.72)  | tricks for, you know, animating things on and off.                                                  |
| [14:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=892.72)  | So we also have stroke dash offset and this is the offset from the start of the stroke,             |
| [14:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=898.08)  | from where it starts to where it ends.                                                              |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=900.08)  | Stroke line cap, this is how the ends of the stroke look.                                           |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=904.22)  | So the values here are butt, round and square.                                                      |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=907.68)  | Butt, B-U-T-T, ends directly at the SVG line.                                                       |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=912.08)  | So like butts up against the line and it's straight out.                                            |
| [15:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=915.12)  | It's like square, but there's no spacing.                                                           |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=917.64)  | It just ends right at the line.                                                                     |
| [15:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=919.28)  | Round, rounds it off.                                                                               |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=920.32)  | So there's a little bit of like padding between the SVG line that is equivalent to what goes        |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=925.24)  | on top and bottom.                                                                                  |
| [15:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=926.24)  | Like imagine you have like a pen line, right?                                                       |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=929.34)  | So if that stroke width is five pixels, you'll have five pixels on either side and then you'll      |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=935.64)  | have the same amount at the end that is rounded off for the line cap here.                          |
| [15:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=941.12)  | And then with square, same thing, but instead of butt, you have that padding of the stroke          |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=945.56)  | width on the end of that pen line.                                                                  |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=950.04)  | So they're a little bit different.                                                                  |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=952.56)  | There's also stroke line join and the values for that are arcs, bevel, miter, miter clip            |
| [15:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=958.48)  | and round.                                                                                          |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=959.68)  | And this is what happens at the tip of say a triangle or an arrow or where the joining              |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=965.22)  | lines switch direction.                                                                             |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=967.44)  | How do those joining lines behave at that point?                                                    |
| [16:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=970.54)  | So for example, miter creates a cut at the tip, like just cuts it off and then as it                |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=975.96)  | switches directions, straight and round would round it off at the tip.                              |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=979.94)  | So these other values, like if you have a sharp direction change, it could get kind                 |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=983.66)  | of crazy.                                                                                           |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=984.66)  | And if you've played SVGs, you've probably likely seen that.                                        |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=988.32)  | So definitely play with the stroke line join.                                                       |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=990.16)  | These are also things that you can see directly if you're building SVGs in a design software        |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=996.4)   | and they do translate to code.                                                                      |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=999.44)  | It's pretty cool to see how this is all like in the spec and you can make changes and style         |
| [16:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1003.52) | it in your CSS.                                                                                     |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1004.52) | So there's also stroke opacity, the opacity of the stroke and stroke width as I mentioned           |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1008.76) | earlier which is the width of the stroke.                                                           |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1011.92) | I know you're not supposed to define things with the same words as in the name but the              |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1017.12) | thickness of the stroke.                                                                            |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1018.44) | There you go.                                                                                       |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1019.44) | Right, yeah, you did well.                                                                          |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1022.2)  | The line cap and line join are like my little secrets where I make icons softer.                    |
| [17:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1028.32) | Just round out those joints, round out the caps and then I feel a lot better about it.              |
| [17:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1033.8)  | Excellent breakdown there.                                                                          |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1035.86) | Next section is on transforming shapes.                                                             |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1037.8)  | So animating shapes like turning a circle into a star, also known as morphing.                      |
| [17:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1044.28) | And this is required that you have the equal number of SVG points between states which              |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1048.4)  | kind of makes sense.                                                                                |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1049.4)  | It's not going to be able to just invent more points and know how to morph them.                    |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1051.96) | So as long as all the points are the same, you can get a nice little thing.                         |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1054.24) | So transitions the positions of those points from point A like a circle to point B into             |
| [17:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1058.3)  | the star.                                                                                           |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1059.3)  | You can do this either with SMIL, S-M-I-L, the language you can encode with an SVG to               |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1063.12) | do these types of animations.                                                                       |
| [17:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1064.36) | It's like a declarative animation language or with JS, the GreenSock Morph SVG Plugin               |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1069.44) | or Snap SVG.                                                                                        |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1070.44) | I think there's a few different libraries to choose from.                                           |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1072.48) | SMIL has been deprecated and no longer being worked on.                                             |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1075.08) | So the recommendation is to use JS or you could try ClipPath which now accepts the path             |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1081.52) | property and it's another way to transform shapes.                                                  |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1085.12) | So same rules that an equal number of points need to exist between in order to morph.               |
| [18:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1088.56) | But I guess the morphing of ClipPath would be like more like morphing a shape and its               |
| [18:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1092.64) | mask versus morphing in an SVG and its path data.                                                   |
| [18:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1098.0)  | You'd be able to do much more robust like I wouldn't need to be filled.                             |
| [18:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1101.96) | Like you could do just a stroked star to a stroked circle for example and that's not                |
| [18:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1105.6)  | something ClipPath would really be good for.                                                        |
| [18:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1107.86) | So nice, let's morphing and transforms.                                                             |
| [18:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1110.94) | That's a cool idea though for the masking, for clipping and masking you could definitely            |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1115.28) | use the path transform now to do that.                                                              |
| [18:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1118.12) | Another thing that I love to do with SVGs is to animate them and you can create really              |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1122.88) | dynamic and complex animations by first starting with an SVG that you might make in design          |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1128.7)  | software and then going to the SVG as Adam was describing at the top of this episode,               |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1134.36) | making sure it's clean so you could then look at what you have and section it off into grouped      |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1140.52) | elements and then you could animate or style those elements.                                        |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1144.56) | So for example if you have a dog SVG you can go in and add a div around the entire head             |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1150.84) | and give it a CSS animation like moving up and down and then you can also section off               |
| [19:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1155.46) | just the tongue and the mouth area and have it move up and down to like stick out of the            |
| [19:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1160.9)  | mouth and back in and you can also isolate the tail and all the elements that make up               |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1165.4)  | the tail and have it do a little wag wag wag.                                                       |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1169.48) | So this is another great way to combine CSS and SVG, creating the baseline for your imagery         |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1175.88) | in SVG and using CSS to animate it.                                                                 |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1179.36) | You can also use Smil which I thought was pronounced smile.                                         |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1183.08) | Oh, is it?                                                                                          |
| [19:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1185.32) | Smil is so much more like approachable sounding than Smil.                                          |
| [19:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1189.52) | Smil sounds like something.                                                                         |
| [19:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1190.52) | I've always called it Smil but it's S-M-I-L to do this or GreenSock or you know good old            |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1197.04) | CSS animations but again it only works with inline SVGs so you can reach into the DOM,              |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1202.32) | find those groupings, find those classes or IDs and then style them like you would any              |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1207.58) | other element.                                                                                      |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1208.58) | Nice.                                                                                               |
| [20:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1209.58) | So you breaking that down reminded me of Flash where I'd go into Flash and I'd be making            |
| [20:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1213.32) | you know little nested groups.                                                                      |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1215.32) | Just like wow, thank you.                                                                           |
| [20:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1216.68) | I don't think I've ever done that in SVG.                                                           |
| [20:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1218.72) | Oh, I used to do this a lot.                                                                        |
| [20:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1220.48) | Like when I was in college I would do this all the time.                                            |
| [20:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1224.24) | I'd like include the animated characters as like one of my favorite things to do.                   |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1229.48) | Oh, I smell a disco dog animation coming up.                                                        |
| [20:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1232.88) | Little vector disco.                                                                                |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1233.96) | There was a dog animation.                                                                          |

| [20:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1245.44) | elements that use CSS to animate them.                                                              |
| [20:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1247.56) | Very cool.                                                                                          |
| [20:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1248.56) | Clever grouping can get you a long way in animation that is for sure.                               |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1251.4)  | All right, well we've shared a couple of tips and tricks along the way as we're sort of             |
| [20:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1254.76) | breaking down inline SVG and external SVG.                                                          |
| [20:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1258.24) | But let's specifically talk about tips, tricks, and hacks like our favorite little things           |
| [21:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1261.96) | to do with SVG.                                                                                     |
| [21:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1263.56) | And I'll start with responsive or adaptive SVG icons.                                               |
| [21:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1267.38) | So it can be really neat to have a level of detail of an icon increase as there's more              |
| [21:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1271.96) | visual space.                                                                                       |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1272.96) | All right.                                                                                          |
| [21:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1273.96) | Like oh, well here more space like container space.                                                 |
| [21:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1276.88) | This could be a really cool thing with container queries but you can also do this with viewports    |
| [21:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1279.88) | or if you're in JavaScript, it's just sort of like if you're on mobile and constrained              |
| [21:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1283.04) | you'd have a very filled house and it'd be very simple and basic with only a few points.            |
| [21:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1288.04) | But as you get more space you can switch to another inline SVG and gain additional details.         |
| [21:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1293.92) | So on desktop you could have this really nice ornate house whereas on mobile it'd be something      |
| [21:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1297.84) | small so you can be responsive and adaptive with your SVG.                                          |
| [21:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1301.96) | Another cool thing about SVG is because you can reach into the code you could actually              |
| [21:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1306.08) | art direct this.                                                                                    |
| [21:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1307.08) | So maybe on mobile screens where you have more vertical space than horizontal space                 |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1311.24) | you want to stack the visualization vertically and like adjust the style.                           |
| [21:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1315.28) | If you have like a jungle of animals and say you have some popping in and out of trees              |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1319.4)  | you could change the placement of those groupings based on the responsive width of your available   |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1325.84) | space.                                                                                              |
| [22:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1326.84) | And I don't know, it's just it's a cool way to kind of expand on how do we think about              |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1330.68) | responsiveness in terms of art direction and SVG really gives us the capabilities to do             |
| [22:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1334.48) | that that something like an image would not be able to do.                                          |
| [22:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1336.88) | You'd have to download a new image for different screen sizes versus using the same image and       |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1341.24) | restyling it with SVG.                                                                              |
| [22:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1344.46) | Great call.                                                                                         |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1345.46) | So there's also a filter hack for color that I mentioned earlier.                                   |
| [22:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1349.16) | I wrote a little CSS tricks article about this.                                                     |
| [22:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1351.56) | It is going to be the show notes but you can use CSS filters to change the color of SVG             |
| [22:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1356.76) | icons if they're not inline, if they're used as images or backgrounds instead.                      |
| [22:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1361.68) | And this does happen often especially with icons folks will use SVG inserted instead                |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1368.2)  | of inline for various reasons.                                                                      |
| [22:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1371.36) | Used doesn't have full browser support so I think that could be a reason like it doesn't            |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1376.04) | work with IE 11 if I recall correctly.                                                              |
| [22:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1378.14) | So anyway if you're using SVG as an image or a background those could be a little bit               |
| [23:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1383.0)  | easier to work with sometimes.                                                                      |
| [23:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1385.92) | You could still apply filters to adjust color values when you don't have access to fill             |
| [23:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1391.4)  | and the way that you would do this is by using CSS filters on that SVG element.                     |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1396.56) | So these filters include like hue to change the hue, saturation to increase or decrease             |
| [23:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1401.54) | saturation and brightness to increase or decrease the elements brightness.                          |
| [23:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1405.52) | And this is a little bit easier when you already have some color on that icon but if you don't      |
| [23:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1410.24) | if it's a plain white icon you can do this little hack to set sepia to one first to force           |
| [23:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1416.56) | it to have some color.                                                                              |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1418.84) | So setting sepia one on a white icon will make it light yellow and then you can use                 |
| [23:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1424.22) | hue and increase saturation and adjust the brightness to get the color value that you're            |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1429.5)  | looking for.                                                                                        |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1430.5)  | So another cool thing is that these are all animatable because it's CSS filters so you              |
| [23:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1434.8)  | can use this as a way to have some sort of response from like a user interaction like               |
| [24:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1440.68) | a hover or focus with your SVG icons or other icons or any icons.                                   |
| [24:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1447.56) | And that reminds me of I think I've used this exact trick to have a bunch of monochromatic          |
| [24:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1452.12) | social icons for example and then when you hover you get Twitter blue and you get YouTube           |
| [24:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1457.16) | red and you know sort of like you can hover and bring back the color that maybe.                    |
| [24:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1463.04) | Some super cool tricks in there.                                                                    |
| [24:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1464.12) | I looked up really quick can I use the use tag and it does have IE11 support but it does            |
| [24:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1469.96) | feel new so anyway I needed to go double check too.                                                 |
| [24:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1473.72) | Well I don't remember there was something I mean it's this has been a long time since               |
| [24:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1478.2)  | I built that library but I remember there was something about browser support that was              |
| [24:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1482.6)  | like oh we should be careful for some reason.                                                       |
| [24:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1485.8)  | Nice yeah don't go all in yet has some edge cases yeah so maybe here's someone make a               |
| [24:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1490.24) | comment or tell us on Twitter what did we miss with the use tag there.                              |
| [24:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1494.78) | Another tip and trick here is SVG duotone icons and HSL are a very great mix.                       |
| [25:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1502.0)  | So if you've got inline SVG and the SVG is prepared and ready to have a really nice duotone         |
| [25:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1506.78) | color and usually this is like you know a bright blue and then like a light blue or                 |
| [25:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1510.28) | a bright orange and a light orange and so the icon is made to have these tints.                     |
| [25:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1513.84) | A really great thing to do is put class names on each of those different sections and then          |
| [25:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1517.8)  | in your CSS it's just a couple of calcs in a color and on some color channels and boom              |
| [25:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1522.76) | you can have really nice adaptive right dark light dim all these different color schemes            |
| [25:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1527.24) | ready on your SVG icons just with a little bit of HSL and anyway it's really nice looking           |
| [25:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1533.4)  | so cool.                                                                                            |
| [25:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1534.4)  | Letting the SVG own its style that's another thing SVG you can put style tags in the SVG            |
| [25:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1539.84) | and let it own its own style so if you're using this as a responsive reusable component             |
| [25:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1546.12) | you could include it as an include and have that own all the styles wherever you place              |
| [25:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1551.84) | it this is kind of like you know container queries ask but for the SVG to self-contain              |
| [25:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1557.66) | styles.                                                                                             |
| [25:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1558.66) | Totally.                                                                                            |
| [26:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1559.66) | So I also talked about stroke effects earlier and stroke dash offset you can use these effects      |
| [26:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1565.68) | to create some really interesting stroke animations and if you have you know an SVG line art design |
| [26:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1572.72) | with a stroke you can use stroke offset to then animate the stroke and you could use                |
| [26:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1576.76) | that in CSS to adjust the stroke offset so you can create like a CSS animation that animates        |
| [26:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1581.68) | the stroke to make an effect like the dancing ant effect for lassos that just keeps sort            |
| [26:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1586.84) | of moving around or you can animate in some cursive text or an image from nothing you               |
| [26:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1592.16) | get like this drawing in effect by creating a CSS animation with a stroke dash offset               |
| [26:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1598.8)  | starting at a large value like 1000 in the stroke dash array equaling that value of a               |
| [26:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1603.68) | thousand so it's gonna be taking up the entire SVG elements the length of the entire element        |
| [26:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1608.0)  | and then you're gonna animate it to zero so it's gonna be sort of moving in as you are              |
| [26:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1613.08) | drawing the sort of path for your element and then it will stay in that position so                 |
| [27:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1619.68) | this is definitely an effect I've seen around the web and I think it's pretty cool.                 |
| [27:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1624.28) | Oh yeah that effect is all over there's like so many cool use cases for it yeah because             |
| [27:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1629.08) | anytime you want to draw in a line I've seen it used for bullets too shooting out of like           |
| [27:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1632.88) | a helicopter you just use the rounded dashes and they just look like and so you animate             |
| [27:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1637.88) | it really fast they look like bullets shooting out of a gun anyway so many cool different           |
| [27:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1641.28) | things you can do with that technique and which comes into my next one here which is                |
| [27:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1644.24) | line length equals one so this is a property you can put on your path or and what this              |
| [27:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1649.36) | does is where you know it's just describing this stroke dash offset matching the dash               |
| [27:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1653.6)  | array as like some large value if you set line length equal to one one is the length                |
| [27:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1659.68) | of whatever the thing is and zero is none so instead of knowing or having to go calculate           |
| [27:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1664.64) | a thousand you just set line length equal to one and this unlocks easier animation maintenance      |
| [27:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1669.48) | of as you draw paths in so it's kind of a hot tip I learned it from the key framers                 |
| [27:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1673.2)  | they use it all the time to make this technique really easy so line length equals one nice          |
| [27:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1678.3)  | I have an accessibility tip here too which is I tend to put aria-hidden true on my SVG              |
| [28:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1682.72) | a lot of my SVG are icons and they're sort of like visual help and visual feedback but              |
| [28:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1686.96) | they're right they're typically decorative and so what I like to do is if I'm using them            |
| [28:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1690.62) | for something visual I'll give them aria-hidden true and if you are using SVG for content           |
| [28:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1694.4)  | be sure to study up on how to ensure the scalable graphic is ready and readable for non-sided       |
| [28:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1699.4)  | users who can't see the vectors I'm pretty sure the text tag is crawled but if you're               |
| [28:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1703.4)  | trying to put more content into your SVG just be weary about how that gets crawled and how          |
| [28:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1708.64) | that can be accessed yeah especially with infographics or things that are core to what              |
| [28:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1714.44) | you're presenting in your UIs so the last thing I want to talk about is actually styling            |
| [28:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1720.52) | CSS using SVG and this is all that filters when you use SVG you don't necessarily need              |
| [28:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1727.24) | to use it to create some sort of visual addition to your page you can use it sort of invisibly      |
| [28:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1734.04) | to use the primitives that SVG provides us in definitions and then use those primitives             |
| [29:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1740.9)  | on your CSS so this I think is maybe my favorite SVG pro tip hot tip and so what you could          |
| [29:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1748.72) | do is you could include an inline SVG with defs and inside of those defs you could create           |
| [29:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1754.52) | filters and from here we can use all of the primitives that SVG provides like separating            |
| [29:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1762.16) | all of the filter effects by values you could separate the RGB values you could add blurs           |
| [29:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1767.76) | you can use the color matrix to set effects and lighting effects and there's like distortions       |
| [29:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1772.86) | there's so many things that you can do you can create like distortions to create like               |
| [29:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1776.44) | ripples on the water and animate that but I really like using filters I'm like a big                |
| [29:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1782.14) | filter fan CSS filters are just shorthands of SVG filter effects so you get a lot more              |
| [29:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1789.12) | power with SVG filters and you can then use those SVG along with your CSS on any part               |
| [29:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1795.56) | of your page not just within the SVG itself by using filter and then URL and then getting           |
| [30:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1802.68) | that ID that you've designated for the filter effect and setting that to the filter property        |
| [30:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1808.6)  | and this can be accessed by all those CSS in your page because you've inlined this SVG              |
| [30:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1816.18) | if you are interested in this technique and how to create duotone effects with this and             |
| [30:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1820.24) | how to create a bunch of different styles and effects I really like Effie color matrix              |
| [30:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1826.32) | because you can do all the transformations in one go there's some great tools that have             |
| [30:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1830.12) | been created about how to use Effie color matrix I wrote an article on list apart that              |
| [30:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1834.2)  | breaks down the different categories of the channels for Effie color matrix RGB alpha               |
| [30:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1841.64) | and then multiplier and how to leverage those to create cool effects they can then apply            |
| [30:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1847.48) | to images and icons and cards and all over the place instead of using the default CSS               |
| [30:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1853.4)  | filters.                                                                                            |
| [30:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1854.4)  | And a quick tip I'm a big fan of the Effie distortion or what's it called Effie displace            |
| [31:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1860.48) | or...                                                                                               |
| [31:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1861.48) | Displacement filters yeah.                                                                          |
| [31:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1862.96) | Yeah so you can turn regular text into like you know that like comic book doodle.                   |
| [31:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1868.44) | Like glitchy effect too.                                                                            |
| [31:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1869.84) | Well you can yeah you can do glitchy or you can make anything look doodly where it has              |
| [31:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1873.72) | this right because you're adding turbulence oh that's what it is Effie turbulence you               |
| [31:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1877.0)  | add this like turbulence and it will wiggle everything and then you can make the animation          |
| [31:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1880.96) | wiggle if you want so that like old school Dilbert animation style like you could do                |
| [31:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1884.72) | that with an Effie turbulence effect that you just animate and it's so powerful.                    |
| [31:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1889.6)  | Yeah you can also add noise like you add Effie noise to the actual graphics to give them            |
| [31:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1893.52) | some kind of texture programmatically and then for animations just like layer things                |
| [31:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1899.04) | up this is why it's SVD is so cool to use with CSS.                                                 |
| [31:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1903.72) | It's so cool yep.                                                                                   |
| [31:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1905.72) | Yeah so thank you for joining us on this episode we know that SVG it can be a whole topic on        |
| [31:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1910.9)  | its own but because it intersects with CSS so much it's just a love story of SVG plus               |
| [31:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0XTZOuRuQ5nSxTAUJ9H7AY?&t=1916.32) | CSS equals heart so we thought that it would be a great topic to cover we hope that you             |
