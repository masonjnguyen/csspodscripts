| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=0.0)     | Hello and welcome back to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility       |
| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=17.56)   | to Z-Index.                                                                                       |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=18.56)   | Today, we're kicking off a mini-series all about CSS Houdini, an umbrella term that describes     |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=24.08)   | a series of browser APIs which give developers more control over their styling by exposing        |
| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=29.64)   | parts of the CSS rendering engine and enabling developers to extend CSS by hooking into the       |
| [00:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=35.4)    | styling and layout processes.                                                                     |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=37.68)   | No longer do developers need to wait for a browser to implement CSS primitives, you can           |
| [00:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=41.82)   | now implement them yourself.                                                                      |
| [00:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=43.68)   | Pretty neat.                                                                                      |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=44.68)   | Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, why would we need this?                                                   |
| [00:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=46.36)   | Why do I need to extend CSS?                                                                      |
| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=48.04)   | It does so much.                                                                                  |
| [00:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=49.18)   | What can't it do?                                                                                 |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=50.18)   | I don't get it.                                                                                   |
| [00:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=51.18)   | There's so much that CSS can't yet do for us.                                                     |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=54.36)   | But with worklists, Houdini allows developers to hook into the styling and layout processes       |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=59.4)    | of the browser's rendering engine.                                                                |
| [01:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=61.36)   | So that means that developers can write their own painting and layout algorithms and essentially  |
| [01:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=67.08)   | teach the browser new tricks.                                                                     |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=68.66)   | So you can actually teach the browser, tell it how you want it to process paint or layout.        |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=73.62)   | So this allows for developers to create layout effects or create borders, backgrounds, imagery,   |
| [01:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=81.68)   | any sort of thing that currently isn't possible in CSS.                                           |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=85.16)   | For example, if you wanted angled corners.                                                        |
| [01:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=88.16)   | That's something that you can't currently do.                                                     |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=89.6)    | You can only have rounded corners, like the rounded border radius.                                |
| [01:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=93.42)   | But with Houdini, you could create a function that accepts values that can set sizes for          |
| [01:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=100.04)  | your corners, set the way that you're painting that canvas, and then apply it as a clip.          |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=106.48)  | So you could like clip that element and you could apply it as a border image.                     |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=109.92)  | You could apply it as backgrounds.                                                                |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=111.64)  | There's a lot of things you can do.                                                               |
| [01:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=113.48)  | And you can also write animation worklets, which enable more performance animations off           |
| [01:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=118.4)   | the main thread.                                                                                  |
| [01:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=119.4)   | I see.                                                                                            |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=120.4)   | So this is like when I'm watching or playing a video game and the UI of the game pops up          |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=124.28)  | and they don't have CSS available.                                                                |
| [02:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=126.48)  | So they're getting jiggy with it and they've got cool paper scroll effects with burnt corners,    |
| [02:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=131.34)  | or maybe it's all super futuristic with three lime green outlines.                                |
| [02:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=135.9)   | That's all on the table then is that I'm sort of bringing a function to the table that will       |
| [02:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=140.52)  | handle whatever it is that I'm looking to do.                                                     |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=142.88)  | Okay, I think that sounds cool.                                                                   |
| [02:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=144.2)   | It makes sense.                                                                                   |
| [02:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=145.2)   | And it sounds like it has a huge advantage here too, because it's going to be running             |
| [02:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=148.96)  | at an optimal time or like right now, a lot of JavaScript styling, like a scroll animation        |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=153.44)  | or something like that would have to show up after the event has happened.                        |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=157.2)   | So as the user scrolled and the browser laid it out and then it says here, JavaScript,            |
| [02:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=161.38)  | do you need to do anything now?                                                                   |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=162.78)  | You're watching this position.                                                                    |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=163.96)  | And then it's always like late to the party.                                                      |
| [02:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=165.8)   | I always feel like so many custom things are just late to the party.                              |
| [02:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=168.76)  | Oh, the page loaded.                                                                              |
| [02:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=169.88)  | Now do your thing.                                                                                |
| [02:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=170.88)  | I'm not, you're always third party.                                                               |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=174.52)  | This sounds like I'm first party.                                                                 |
| [02:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=176.84)  | This is like me hooking into the engine is like a first party.                                    |
| [03:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=179.8)   | Is that sort of what you're saying here?                                                          |
| [03:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=181.52)  | Exactly.                                                                                          |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=182.52)  | So Houdini enables us to write fewer JavaScript dependencies and polyfills.                       |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=187.2)   | And it lets users write true CSS polyfills that the browser can better understand.                |
| [03:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=192.08)  | Got it.                                                                                           |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=193.08)  | Okay, so we're bringing like unique things that can't be done today.                              |
| [03:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=196.08)  | That might be kind of a little fringy.                                                            |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=198.72)  | Like, well, hey, fringe is a good example.                                                        |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=200.48)  | Let's say you want like fringe edges.                                                             |
| [03:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=202.66)  | Maybe not every site in the world wants fringe edges.                                             |
| [03:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=204.78)  | So they're not going to make a standard about it.                                                 |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=206.16)  | But you could sort of create a paint function that paints fringed edges and it does it at         |
| [03:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=211.16)  | the lowest level.                                                                                 |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=212.16)  | It's like a first party paint effect.                                                             |
| [03:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=214.0)   | That sounds awesome.                                                                              |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=215.0)   | Exactly.                                                                                          |
| [03:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=216.0)   | It allows us to prototype and implement new things now instead of waiting for browser             |
| [03:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=219.08)  | engines to implement them first.                                                                  |
| [03:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=220.88)  | And this enables some interesting opportunities for progressive enhancement as well.              |
| [03:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=224.98)  | But Houdini is not just about worklets.                                                           |
| [03:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=227.52)  | We've sort of been talking about layout animation and paint worklets.                             |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=231.0)   | It also allows more semantic CSS so that there are performance optimizations in how the browser   |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=237.88)  | actually reads and parses CSS.                                                                    |
| [04:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=240.68)  | And it gives the developer an opportunity to have things like sort of type checking               |
| [04:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=245.56)  | in CSS and more control over the styles they're writing.                                          |
| [04:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=249.4)   | So it's pretty cool.                                                                              |
| [04:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=250.72)  | And those two topics, the typed object model and properties and values API are the first          |
| [04:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=255.36)  | two topics that we want to get into when discussing this CSS Houdini series.                      |
| [04:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=260.44)  | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [04:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=261.44)  | Okay, so I'm sold on Houdini.                                                                     |
| [04:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=263.0)   | This is just a extra layer for us to bring in new animations, new paint, and new layouts.         |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=269.46)  | And we do this by bringing a custom function and writing some CSS that will be information        |
| [04:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=274.64)  | that the function can use to do some work.                                                        |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=276.92)  | So let's start with that like first crucial moment you're talking about properties and            |
| [04:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=281.44)  | values.                                                                                           |
| [04:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=282.72)  | And these are where we are creating our initial hooks into the engine.                            |
| [04:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=286.12)  | So before we've even made a function that can do something really interesting, we need            |
| [04:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=290.76)  | to sort of articulate an API for it.                                                              |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=292.96)  | Like what values does it take and we can do this through custom properties.                       |
| [04:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=296.5)   | You can write those on the element itself in the CSS.                                             |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=299.3)   | So here's custom property, the edge angle, and how you know, thick it should be and things        |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=303.82)  | like that.                                                                                        |
| [05:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=304.82)  | These are properties that you can pass and then your custom paint function would receive          |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=307.72)  | those as custom properties, or you can use arguments and pass in information as an argument       |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=313.04)  | just like a paint function.                                                                       |
| [05:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=314.32)  | So if you think like background image, that's a function and you're passing arguments into        |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=318.12)  | it.                                                                                               |
| [05:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=319.12)  | So we can use these custom properties and values as hooks into the custom work that               |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=323.0)   | we're doing.                                                                                      |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=324.0)   | So we're integrating with the parser.                                                             |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=325.38)  | So just right off the bat, like this is CSS that's going to get read by the parser.               |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=329.54)  | And since we're going to do another part here, that's going to teach it what those values         |
| [05:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=333.28)  | are.                                                                                              |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=334.28)  | So when custom properties become rich and typed and they become error free, they will             |
| [05:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=339.08)  | be known and passed to our function as accepted and identified parameters.                        |
| [05:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=343.54)  | So anyway, we'll get more into that.                                                              |
| [05:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=344.96)  | Another really cool thing is here is other than being a first party integrated with the           |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=348.16)  | parser and integrated with the engine, these are no longer a string.                              |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=351.64)  | You're a registered custom property, right?                                                       |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=353.62)  | You've been stamped.                                                                              |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=354.62)  | It's almost like your TSA pre-check.                                                              |
| [05:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=356.12)  | Your custom property has a cool stamp that's approved by the engine.                              |
| [06:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=360.14)  | But just like other things, the cascade still applies.                                            |
| [06:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=362.78)  | So let's say you have some of these custom properties that have been typed.                       |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=365.86)  | If you have the property written more than one time, the last one read wins.                      |
| [06:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=369.56)  | So it's the same sort of scenario as you get normally.                                            |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=372.88)  | And then yeah, we've articulated that these custom properties and values can come as input        |
| [06:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=377.6)   | arguments or input properties.                                                                    |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=379.78)  | And input properties are again, are custom properties set alongside the custom function           |
| [06:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=383.68)  | that you're going to call like this paint function.                                               |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=385.48)  | And the input arguments would be arguments you'd pass in the function itself.                     |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=388.58)  | So they have distinct advantages and disadvantages to the two strategies.                         |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=392.28)  | And I'm going to let you break that down a little bit.                                            |
| [06:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=394.04)  | So there are two ways to actually register custom properties or to set Houdini custom             |
| [06:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=399.44)  | properties.                                                                                       |
| [06:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=400.44)  | And these are custom properties that have additional values to describe them by.                  |
| [06:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=405.3)   | So the first way is to use the register property function in JavaScript.                          |
| [06:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=409.44)  | And there's a newer way that was implemented in Chromium 85.                                      |
| [06:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=412.36)  | And that's the app property rule in CSS.                                                          |
| [06:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=415.12)  | So if you wanted to write this in JavaScript, you could use registered property.                  |
| [06:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=418.96)  | And that looks like is CSS dot register property, and then open parentheses, and then you're      |
| [07:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=423.88)  | going to set an object here.                                                                      |
| [07:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=425.84)  | So this is going to be adding a registered property to the CSS interface.                         |
| [07:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=430.48)  | And inside of this object, what you need is a name.                                               |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=433.72)  | So that's going to be your variable name, it starts with two dashes, it could be like             |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=437.12)  | my color, that's going to be a string, then you have a syntax.                                    |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=440.24)  | And the syntax is going to be a variety of values that we'll get into.                            |
| [07:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=443.32)  | But say you want to make that a color, you'd have a string and then in angle brackets,            |
| [07:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=448.62)  | the syntax of color, then you have an initial value.                                              |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=451.84)  | So you set a fallback value for this variable or this custom property.                            |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=456.44)  | So say you want that to be black or pink or whatever else, you set that in the string,            |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=460.04)  | and then you set if it inherits, that's true or false.                                            |
| [07:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=462.58)  | So you can set this if it would inherit from its parent or not.                                   |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=465.3)   | So the new way to write this with app property now is directly in CSS.                            |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=470.18)  | You don't have to write this in your JavaScript, you can just put it in your CSS files, along     |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=473.9)   | with all of your other custom properties that are set in your design system.                      |
| [07:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=477.84)  | So to write an app property custom property, you would put at property and then the name,         |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=483.5)   | so dash dash my color, that's the name.                                                           |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=486.24)  | And this does not have to be in a string.                                                         |
| [08:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=488.12)  | And then inside of this, you would have open and closed curly braces, not object syntax,          |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=493.24)  | but this is CSS syntax now.                                                                       |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=495.32)  | So then you would have a syntax value, that syntax is in quotes, the value type.                  |
| [08:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=499.72)  | So that would be in angle brackets color again, you have the initial value.                       |
| [08:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=503.8)   | So here you would set the color value in a string and then if inherits or not.                    |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=510.4)   | The initial value does not have to be a string in the CSS version, it does in the JavaScript      |
| [08:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=515.04)  | version.                                                                                          |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=516.08)  | So this is sort of CSS syntax versus JavaScript syntax.                                           |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=520.26)  | And it just allows for you to have a single location to store all of your property values.        |
| [08:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=524.6)   | Nice.                                                                                             |
| [08:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=525.6)   | And yeah, when you type a custom property that way, whether from JavaScript or CSS,               |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=529.56)  | it not only registers it and makes it that TSA pre-check, it also can be animated since           |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=535.24)  | its type is known and you can fix its type and say it can only be this type.                      |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=539.2)   | It now can know how to interpolate between values.                                                |
| [09:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=541.92)  | Anyway, it's like there's so many nested little.                                                  |
| [09:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=544.16)  | Yeah, it gives it meaning.                                                                        |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=545.16)  | It gives it meaning.                                                                              |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=546.16)  | There's like so many cool little things you can get from this.                                    |
| [09:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=547.94)  | And so we're barely scraping the surface.                                                         |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=549.7)   | We're sorry everybody, but that's kind of what we have to do.                                     |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=552.68)  | We can't go too deep on that stuff.                                                               |
| [09:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=554.28)  | I want to next go into the syntaxes, which you mentioned in there.                                |
| [09:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=557.9)   | So you used the syntax of color and that was in an angle bracket.                                 |
| [09:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=562.06)  | So it was like, yeah, it was just angle.                                                          |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=564.04)  | Well, that's funny.                                                                               |
| [09:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=565.12)  | It's angle color and then end angle, but it's not an end angle.                                   |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=568.08)  | So it's just kind of like, anyway, it's enclosed in angles, very normal type nomenclature.        |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=572.36)  | And that was referencing literally the CSS type.                                                  |
| [09:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=574.78)  | So that's a type in the spec.                                                                     |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=576.46)  | And that is a really handy way for us to say the values that we accept are this typed thing       |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=581.2)   | in CSS already.                                                                                   |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=582.26)  | So it will already parse any value that someone puts in there and make sure it is a color.        |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=587.56)  | And if not, it will do its normal CSS thing, just to have an empty value there and error          |
| [09:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=593.18)  | gracefully.                                                                                       |
| [09:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=594.18)  | So it's kind of nice.                                                                             |
| [09:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=595.18)  | Although I think you do get errors in the console now if you've typed something and               |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=598.48)  | someone passes something that's not valid.                                                        |
| [10:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=600.0)   | So you can get some good feedback that way.                                                       |
| [10:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=602.12)  | Okay, so we have these syntaxes.                                                                  |
| [10:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=603.74)  | We have color and this syntax is called the CSS value definition syntax.                          |
| [10:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=608.26)  | It's another micro syntax inside of CSS.                                                          |
| [10:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=610.92)  | And the syntax is for, it's like a syntax of syntaxes you can think of, but it requires           |
| [10:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=615.54)  | a lot of knowledge about CSS units.                                                               |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=617.58)  | So if you need to brush up on your CSS units, we have an episode for you, episode number          |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=622.1)   | eight on sizing units.                                                                            |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=623.78)  | So go ahead and review that.                                                                      |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=625.34)  | Check it out.                                                                                     |
| [10:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=626.34)  | All the stuff below is going to get confusing because we're going to go over length and           |
| [10:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=629.36)  | resolution and time and numbers and transform functions.                                          |
| [10:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=633.24)  | And if that stuff is foreign, that's a good episode.                                              |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=635.98)  | Okay, so each of the following syntaxes for these value definitions use the angle bracket         |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=640.02)  | type notation and they use or pipes.                                                              |
| [10:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=643.38)  | So like an or pipe is like just the single vertical pipe.                                         |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=646.54)  | Anyway, it's like you use it in JavaScript to say this or that.                                   |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=649.1)   | Those are combinators.                                                                            |
| [10:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=650.1)   | You'll see those in this micro syntax.                                                            |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=651.76)  | And then we also have some multipliers.                                                           |
| [10:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=653.82)  | So we have value notation, we have combinators and we have multipliers.                           |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=658.74)  | All right, y'all ready to get into this micro syntax that's inside of CSS called the CSS          |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=663.82)  | value definition syntax?                                                                          |
| [11:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=664.82)  | Let's do it.                                                                                      |
| [11:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=665.82)  | Sounds so fun, right?                                                                             |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=667.82)  | Okay, so the first one that you can pass is a length.                                             |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=670.94)  | Well, the first one we're going to talk about.                                                    |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=672.18)  | Look, I already talked about color, but length.                                                   |
| [11:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=674.28)  | So that's open angle, length and angle.                                                           |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=676.74)  | And this is for things like pixels, rims, viewports, percentages, you know, that sort             |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=680.3)   | of stuff.                                                                                         |
| [11:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=681.3)   | This would be one rim, 20 pixel, two characters, 30%.                                             |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=683.7)   | These are lengths.                                                                                |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=684.88)  | Then you have a different type called a length dash percentage.                                   |
| [11:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=688.46)  | So again, that's enclosed in angles and this accepts everything that a length does or that        |
| [11:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=693.04)  | a percentage does with the additional ability for it to do a calc function against an percentage  |
| [11:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=699.76)  | and a length.                                                                                     |
| [11:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=701.24)  | So this is something a length can't do.                                                           |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=702.82)  | It can't resolve a length and a percentage calculation, whereas a length percentage can.          |
| [11:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=707.46)  | So can they give us like a super type?                                                            |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=709.66)  | Then what other types are there, you know, that we can put into this micro syntax?                |
| [11:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=713.1)   | That calc function is pretty cool.                                                                |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=715.1)   | So the next type is an angle type and angle can be used with HSL color or kind of gradients,      |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=720.9)   | anything that uses an angle or a degree in it.                                                    |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=724.06)  | And there's also time and you'd likely be using time referring to animations or time              |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=728.34)  | based like a seconds value or milliseconds, anything like that here.                              |
| [12:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=733.02)  | Right.                                                                                            |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=734.02)  | And so let's say your custom paint function needs to take a resolution like a screen resolution.  |
| [12:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=738.24)  | You could use the resolution type that's surrounded by angles.                                    |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=741.48)  | There's also the integer type and the integer is a positive or negative whole number only.        |
| [12:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=746.42)  | So you can think of this like a Z index.                                                          |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=748.58)  | Z index is always positive or negative and as a whole number, that is an integer.                 |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=752.22)  | So you can specify that for your custom prop.                                                     |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=754.3)   | Kind of neat.                                                                                     |
| [12:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=755.3)   | Yeah, nice.                                                                                       |
| [12:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=756.3)   | Next is number.                                                                                   |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=757.3)   | This one is pretty straightforward.                                                               |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=758.46)  | It's a number value which allows for more semantic parsing of math values.                        |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=763.42)  | I use this one a lot.                                                                             |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=764.66)  | An example is I used it to represent the number of underlines in a work that I wrote to add       |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=769.72)  | multiple underlines.                                                                              |
| [12:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=771.4)   | So I just use it as a number type.                                                                |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=773.56)  | There's also percentage and I've used percentage for animating linear gradients because as        |
| [12:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=778.46)  | you mentioned earlier, when you apply a syntax for color or for percentage in this case,          |
| [13:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=785.04)  | you can actually give meaning to some of the interpolations and animations, interactions          |
| [13:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=790.18)  | that you're doing.                                                                                |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=791.74)  | And so when you write a custom property for anything like say a linear gradient, that             |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=798.42)  | linear gradient can't currently move from one state to another because it is parsed               |
| [13:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=803.98)  | as a string.                                                                                      |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=804.98)  | But when you break down the values that go inside the linear gradient like the colors             |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=807.84)  | and percentages, then you can animate those specific values and you see an interaction.           |
| [13:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=812.48)  | So that's sort of a nice effect for using the properties and values API and for using             |
| [13:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=817.3)   | the percentage syntax type for Hever and focus states.                                            |
| [13:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=819.86)  | Totally.                                                                                          |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=820.86)  | Great example.                                                                                    |
| [13:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=821.86)  | We've got the color type which we talked about already, which would allow a user to pass          |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=825.64)  | a keyword or HSL or RGB or hex, you know, those sort of things, any valid color.                  |
| [13:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=830.26)  | There's also the awesome transform dash function.                                                 |
| [13:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=833.24)  | So this is again enclosed in angles and this is so that you can accept a 2D or a 3D set           |
| [13:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=838.06)  | of transforms.                                                                                    |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=839.54)  | So like a single transform would be translate Y 100%, but you could pass a whole set of           |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=844.42)  | things in there and it would be verified and validated before it was sent to your custom          |
| [14:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=849.18)  | function.                                                                                         |
| [14:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=850.18)  | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=851.18)  | You can type out the whole matrix basically.                                                      |
| [14:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=852.66)  | Hey, I accept a matrix.                                                                           |
| [14:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=853.98)  | It's kind of fun.                                                                                 |
| [14:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=854.98)  | We also have the custom identifier or like a glob selector.                                       |
| [14:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=858.66)  | And this one looks like open angle bracket custom dash ident and then close angle brackets.       |
| [14:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=863.92)  | And this is pretty neat because you can pretty much put anything in here.                         |
| [14:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=867.46)  | It's sort of like a et cetera or miscellaneous syntax.                                            |
| [14:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=871.1)   | So I've used this to accept string values.                                                        |
| [14:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=873.64)  | An example is a work that I wrote for angled corners and that work let's I had mentioned          |
| [14:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=877.7)   | the top of the show.                                                                              |
| [14:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=878.7)   | It had two different modes and outlined or filled mode.                                           |
| [14:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=882.1)   | The outline mode and filled mode were custom identifiers.                                         |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=886.18)  | So I use these as input arguments, which Adam went over a little bit earlier too.                 |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=890.7)   | And I use them as input arguments for a paint worklet.                                            |
| [14:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=894.02)  | And based on that fill mode, the custom identifier that was an input argument, there was a little |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=899.06)  | bit of logic that was in the worklet to determine what the output was.                            |
| [15:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=902.74)  | So I found that one to be really useful.                                                          |
| [15:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=905.26)  | Me too.                                                                                           |
| [15:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=906.26)  | I did it so that it had like a fun syntax for my function.                                        |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=909.66)  | So I made this gradient function.                                                                 |
| [15:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=911.54)  | It's like a custom static gradient.                                                               |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=913.54)  | And one of the things that you can pass in there is a number for what's the size of the           |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=918.18)  | squares that you get in the static.                                                               |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=919.7)   | I love that one.                                                                                  |
| [15:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=920.7)   | Thanks.                                                                                           |
| [15:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=921.7)   | But numbers are just like one through 30.                                                         |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=923.9)   | It's like, well, that's boring.                                                                   |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=925.38)  | So my syntax that I passed in my custom property said, well, they can pass a number or here's     |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=930.3)   | a bunch of fun identifiers that they can say small, medium, large.                                |
| [15:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=934.78)  | And so I got to map those internally in my function that says, well, someone's put small          |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=939.26)  | here, map that to a size two square.                                                              |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=942.08)  | And if someone says large map it to this size.                                                    |
| [15:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=944.16)  | And so users could use my function and even pass values that are completely fun.                  |
| [15:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=950.9)   | It's just fun.                                                                                    |
| [15:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=952.38)  | This is where you can really build on this.                                                       |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=954.14)  | I could really see this as a great use case for a design system within a larger org.              |
| [15:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=959.3)   | Also you could use custom properties to represent those input arguments.                          |
| [16:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=963.26)  | So if you created a custom property on the page, then you could update what the value             |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=966.96)  | of small, large and medium is and sort of have your own customized style sheet there.             |
| [16:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=972.1)   | Well, all style sheets are customized, but anyway, it's just these concepts all build             |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=975.86)  | on each other.                                                                                    |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=976.86)  | So it's pretty cool.                                                                              |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=977.86)  | Good call.                                                                                        |
| [16:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=978.86)  | And then finally, I'm going to talk about custom.                                                 |
| [16:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=981.38)  | All of your internal jargon could be baked into your CSS and you could say like the padding       |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=985.74)  | top is some custom name.                                                                          |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=987.74)  | Anyway, you could really go to us.                                                                |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=988.74)  | That's what's fun here, right?                                                                    |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=989.74)  | As you're writing your own hooks to go do whatever you want.                                      |
| [16:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=991.74)  | You're like, let someone write this with this syntax and parse it for me.                         |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=995.26)  | And then I'm going to go do whatever I want with it.                                              |
| [16:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=997.38)  | Thank you.                                                                                        |
| [16:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=998.38)  | Bye.                                                                                              |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=999.38)  | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1000.38) | Okay.                                                                                             |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1001.38) | We were talking about the micro syntax and the types of values that you're describing             |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1004.9)  | can be accepted into your custom property.                                                        |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1007.02) | All right.                                                                                        |
| [16:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1008.02) | So this is used to a resource or an asset like an image.                                          |
| [16:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1009.98) | So this is you saying I want to accept a path and like slash favicon.svg and then your worklet    |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1015.58) | could go grab that asset and do something neat with it.                                           |
| [16:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1018.74) | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [17:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1019.74) | And you can use multipliers for these too.                                                        |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1021.62) | So there is a micro syntax within this that allows for describing more than one value             |
| [17:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1027.34) | to be accepted.                                                                                   |
| [17:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1028.94) | So this multiplier would appear immediately after the syntax name.                                |
| [17:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1032.28) | So after that closing caret and there's two different types of multipliers.                       |
| [17:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1036.3)  | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [17:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1037.3)  | So there's a plus that you can put at the end of something.                                       |
| [17:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1039.82) | So if you did like open angle length and angle and then a plus symbol, this would say I accept    |
| [17:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1044.86) | a space separated list of links.                                                                  |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1047.66) | So kind of neat.                                                                                  |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1048.66) | And there's also the hash.                                                                        |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1050.04) | So if you had, for example, color and angle brackets, then a hash that would accept a             |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1054.78) | comma separated list of color values as the color syntax.                                         |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1059.46) | And I've seen this, I've seen the plus I believe used in a conic gradient worklet, which allowed  |
| [17:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1067.1)  | for multiple color values to be input within the argument list.                                   |
| [17:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1071.98) | And that could very easily have been a comma separated list of color values.                      |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1075.3)  | It just really depends on how you want to write this.                                             |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1078.54) | It is pretty open ended.                                                                          |
| [18:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1080.18) | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| [18:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1081.18) | Lovely.                                                                                           |
| [18:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1082.18) | Open ended is lovely.                                                                             |
| [18:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1083.18) | So that was multipliers and now we have combinators.                                              |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1085.18) | The first one we've talked about is the or combinators.                                           |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1087.34) | She would say length or percentage.                                                               |
| [18:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1089.88) | And well, in this case, that would be confusing because there's the length percentage type.       |
| [18:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1094.48) | So we don't want to confuse, but you can kind of build your own parent types by specifying        |
| [18:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1099.08) | with the subtypes that you accept.                                                                |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1100.34) | So kind of neat.                                                                                  |
| [18:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1101.34) | Maybe like integer or number, although they're very, very, very similar.                          |
| [18:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1104.14) | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                    |
| [18:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1105.14) | And so you can make combinators and this, you could put things in here like links, percentages.   |
| [18:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1108.62) | Oh, this would be if I did length and percentage, it could accept all sorts of different neat     |
| [18:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1112.58) | things.                                                                                           |
| [18:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1113.58) | So yeah, kind of up to you.                                                                       |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1114.58) | Yeah, that makes sense.                                                                           |
| [18:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1115.58) | But you can also do this with your custom idents.                                                 |
| [18:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1117.3)  | So you could say I accept rad or radder or raddest and someone could pass all three if            |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1123.36) | they wanted to or wait, no, that would be me saying here's my sizes.                              |
| [18:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1126.66) | Okay, this is what I did with my sizes was I said you could do small, medium or large             |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1130.78) | and I put an or separator between them.                                                           |
| [18:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1132.66) | You're enumerating what the value that you can accept is.                                         |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1136.02) | So when it comes to a syntax, you can accept multiple types of syntaxes.                          |
| [19:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1140.42) | Definitely.                                                                                       |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1141.42) | Like with a width, the length and percentage makes sense.                                         |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1143.34) | Yep.                                                                                              |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1144.34) | Awesome.                                                                                          |
| [19:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1145.34) | And then so that was multipliers, combinators and all the syntaxes that you can do come           |
| [19:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1148.66) | together and you can write something like my custom property accepts the keyword of rad           |
| [19:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1153.3)  | or a color list that's separated by commas or a number.                                           |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1158.54) | And then your worklet can just go do whatever it wants with whatever value it got.                |
| [19:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1162.38) | So kind of cool.                                                                                  |
| [19:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1163.44) | I wonder what that would look like.                                                               |
| [19:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1165.62) | Yeah, what would that function do?                                                                |
| [19:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1167.58) | I don't know.                                                                                     |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1168.58) | Sounds like that custom property is a little overloaded, but you know, I don't know.              |
| [19:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1171.58) | Yep.                                                                                              |
| [19:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1172.58) | All right.                                                                                        |
| [19:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1173.58) | Well, so that was custom properties and values.                                                   |
| [19:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1174.58) | Just to recap in this episode, in this mini Houdini episode, we covered how to extend             |
| [19:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1179.06) | CSS and create our own interfaces for a custom CSS feature.                                       |
| [19:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1183.3)  | We choose between function parameters or custom properties as the means of providing options.     |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1187.66) | And we describe those parameters so that CSS will identify and provide them to our custom         |
| [19:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1192.02) | functionality all typed and ready to go.                                                          |
| [19:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1194.58) | It's our language to hook into the CSS engine so it doesn't throw away the custom CSS will        |
| [19:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1198.78) | be asking authors to write.                                                                       |
| [20:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1200.46) | It's error safe, developer friendly CSS interfaces for everybody, and it's just the start of      |

| [20:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uE2ZqYdQekeqOATayKZNQ?&t=1206.54) | I loved that wrap up.                                                                             |
