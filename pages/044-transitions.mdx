| [00:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=0.0)     | Welcome to the CSS podcast, where we cover all things CSS from accessibility to z-index.             |
| [00:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=18.68)   | Today we're transitioning our podcast into transitions.                                              |
| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=23.0)    | Transitions are little effects from one state to another that bring a web page to life and           |
| [00:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=28.06)   | more importantly, provide user feedback.                                                             |
| [00:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=31.38)   | You can use transitions anywhere on a page.                                                          |
| [00:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=33.7)    | For example, you can change the color of a link when you hover over it.                              |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=37.6)    | You could transition a menu to slide in or apply a smooth entry for your page's images               |
| [00:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=43.36)   | and cards.                                                                                           |
| [00:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=44.82)   | With transitions, you control the speed and ease from the start to the end state.                    |
| [00:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=49.6)    | They have a lot in common with CSS animations, and you can even broadly think of them as             |
| [00:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=53.52)   | more of a simplified form of CSS animation because there's only two states.                          |
| [00:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=58.4)    | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=59.4)    | Yes, like the goal, we want to just transition changed values in CSS.                                |
| [01:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=63.88)   | You know, it was at 10 and now it's at 20.                                                           |
| [01:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=66.22)   | Can you take me there over a second or so?                                                           |
| [01:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=68.92)   | And CSS transitions say, okay, just give me some time and we will animate it smoothly                |
| [01:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=73.46)   | for you.                                                                                             |
| [01:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=74.46)   | And it's just kind of that easy.                                                                     |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=75.7)    | And it's this concept called interpolation, where you give it two values, an amount of               |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=80.2)    | time, and it will tick along the way, micro adjusting properties from value one to value             |
| [01:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=84.48)   | two.                                                                                                 |
| [01:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=85.48)   | So yeah, exactly with interpolation, you get all those steps in between from state one               |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=89.74)   | to state two, A to B, but you can only interpolate when you have identical value types.              |
| [01:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=96.72)   | So that is pretty key here.                                                                          |
| [01:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=98.1)    | You can't interpolate everything because not everything has the ability to transition on             |
| [01:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=103.78)  | that gradient scale.                                                                                 |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=105.74)  | So for example, you can interpolate CSS filters, but you can't interpolate CSS blend modes           |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=111.6)   | because blend modes are on or off and filters have a value that can be a gradient of values.         |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=117.2)   | And like, speaking of gradients, it's another thing that you can't transition because a              |
| [02:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=120.16)  | gradient is something that is an image to the browser.                                               |
| [02:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=124.1)   | It's viewed as an image.                                                                             |
| [02:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=125.2)   | You're creating a painted image, but there is something you can do with that.                        |
| [02:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=129.84)  | Using app property, you can actually create custom property values and get them in syntax.           |
| [02:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=134.2)   | We had a show about this with all the power of custom properties and the Houdini app property        |
| [02:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=141.88)  | value and all the things you can do with that.                                                       |
| [02:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=142.88)  | So if you are creating custom properties and setting a syntax, then you can transition               |
| [02:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=147.36)  | between values because of that syntax.                                                               |
| [02:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=149.76)  | You're teaching the browser what the type is for that custom property value, and then                |
| [02:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=154.28)  | you can use that type to create transitions.                                                         |
| [02:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=157.64)  | So like with gradients, you can create a property, custom property type, and then transition         |
| [02:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=164.12)  | that type instead of trying to transition the whole gradient because that won't work.                |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=167.84)  | You can just transition that specific value and that would interpolate and give you that             |
| [02:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=171.8)   | nice smooth change from state A to state B.                                                          |
| [02:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=175.0)   | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| [02:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=176.0)   | You've essentially isolated the scope so that you're not animating a gradient, you're animating      |
| [03:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=181.32)  | a piece of it and you've typed the piece.                                                            |
| [03:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=183.74)  | So the browser is like, oh, I know how to interpolate these things.                                  |
| [03:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=186.76)  | And yeah, it's really nice.                                                                          |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=188.88)  | App properties kind of your escape hatch for some of these in that way, which is really              |
| [03:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=192.92)  | cool and nice breakdown.                                                                             |
| [03:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=194.8)   | We can also transition per property.                                                                 |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=196.8)   | So she mentioned some properties there we can transition on, or there's this word called             |
| [03:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=200.36)  | all.                                                                                                 |
| [03:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=201.36)  | So sometimes you'll see transition colon all and you specify a time and it's like any property.      |
| [03:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=206.84)  | But we'll unpack later that all doesn't really mean all.                                             |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=210.04)  | It's anyway, we'll get there.                                                                        |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=212.48)  | But another really cool thing about transitions is that they're interruptible.                       |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=220.12)  | Sometimes you have like a new user interaction that could just interrupt another one and             |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=224.2)   | CSS transitions, they will make the right choice and come out with the right animation               |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=228.72)  | at the end.                                                                                          |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=229.72)  | And it's a really cool feature of them.                                                              |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=230.72)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [03:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=231.72)  | So let's get into transition properties.                                                             |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=234.0)   | The first one is called transition property.                                                         |
| [03:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=237.44)  | And this is a property that tells the browser which CSS property you want to transition.             |
| [04:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=242.52)  | So it accepts a custom identifier and this custom identifier is typically looking for                |
| [04:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=246.9)   | an existing property like color or transform or opacity, things like that.                           |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=253.72)  | So you would write transition color or you'd write transition property colon color.                  |
| [04:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=259.12)  | And that would tell the browser that that is what you're looking to transition.                      |
| [04:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=263.56)  | As Adam just mentioned, you can set it to a keyword like all, which means transition                 |
| [04:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=268.64)  | everything, transition all the properties that we can transition or none, which means                |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=272.7)   | transition none of those properties.                                                                 |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=274.44)  | In addition, you could have multiple values here.                                                    |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=277.12)  | So you could do a comma separated list like a transition property, transform comma color.            |
| [04:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=282.44)  | And this would specify that you want to transition the transform property and the color property     |
| [04:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=286.68)  | of that element from one state to another.                                                           |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=289.0)   | So this is the first thing that you have to set when you are defining a transition.                  |
| [04:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=292.6)   | Very nice.                                                                                           |
| [04:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=293.6)   | And the next is duration.                                                                            |
| [04:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=294.6)   | And this answers the question of how long should it take when some new property is set.              |
| [04:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=299.4)   | So when it's changing these states, how long should it take?                                         |
| [05:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=301.48)  | And it accepts a time value and that's going to be something like one second or 500 milliseconds.    |
| [05:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=306.36)  | And the default is zero seconds.                                                                     |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=307.84)  | So that's why things have no duration.                                                               |
| [05:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=310.92)  | And it's not animatable.                                                                             |
| [05:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=312.48)  | So you can't transition on transition duration.                                                      |
| [05:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=315.4)   | So anyway, it's like one of those things that's like, what does not all mean?                        |
| [05:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=319.92)  | Well, it's like things like this.                                                                    |
| [05:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=321.08)  | You can't transition the transition duration.                                                        |
| [05:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=322.96)  | That'd be weird.                                                                                     |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=323.96)  | Anyway, okay.                                                                                        |
| [05:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=324.96)  | You're next.                                                                                         |
| [05:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=325.96)  | So next we have the transition timing function.                                                      |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=328.48)  | And this is really similar to the animation timing function.                                         |
| [05:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=330.88)  | So here you can set how you want the values to transition.                                           |
| [05:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=334.6)   | So you got the property, you have the duration of that property.                                     |
| [05:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=337.12)  | Now in that duration, how should it transition?                                                      |
| [05:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=340.46)  | So this accepts some keywords.                                                                       |
| [05:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=342.3)   | There's auto, there's ease in, ease out, ease in out, linear, step start and step end.               |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=348.22)  | So you could do something that feels more organic by giving it some sort of ease, or                 |
| [05:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=352.2)   | you could do a step function.                                                                        |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=354.02)  | So back to that idea of ease, you could do even a custom cubic Bezier function.                      |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=358.76)  | So you could do something like transition timing function, colon, cubic dash Bezier.                 |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=363.72)  | And then the values in there accepts four values.                                                    |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=365.64)  | So you could do like cubic Bezier, zero comma one comma one comma zero.                              |
| [06:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=369.4)   | So here you would be creating your own easing curve and easing function.                             |
| [06:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=373.04)  | And we talk about this more in our functions episode.                                                |
| [06:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=376.86)  | And then if you want something that's more stop and go, so stop and start, you can use               |
| [06:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=381.6)   | steps.                                                                                               |
| [06:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=382.6)   | So instead of that smooth transition, you could have a step animation.                               |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=385.06)  | So here you would be using the steps function and you could write something like transition          |
| [06:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=388.28)  | timing function, colon, then steps, the number of steps, like 10 comma jump end.                     |
| [06:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=393.08)  | There's a few keyword values here, like jump start, jump end, how you want it to transition          |
| [06:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=396.88)  | using the step values.                                                                               |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=398.48)  | And you can also have multiple timing functions.                                                     |
| [06:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=401.0)   | You could have transition timing function, ease in, comma step start, and then comma                 |
| [06:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=405.78)  | cubic Bezier, zero one one zero.                                                                     |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=407.58)  | So there's a way to define multiple types of transitions for different transition properties         |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=414.46)  | all at the same time with the transition timing function and the other properties you're setting.    |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=419.84)  | Awesome.                                                                                             |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=420.84)  | A weird thing is there's no ease out in, there's ease in out, but no ease out in.                    |
| [07:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=427.32)  | I've never thought about that before.                                                                |
| [07:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=429.28)  | I've never needed it, but I don't remember where I heard that, but I was like, oh yeah,              |
| [07:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=433.6)   | that's weird.                                                                                        |
| [07:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=434.6)   | And I like ease in out.                                                                              |
| [07:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=435.6)   | It can be a really nice one.                                                                         |
| [07:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=437.0)   | And then recently I heard David Korshid, or you might know him as David K. Piano say that            |
| [07:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=442.36)  | when you're making these cubic Bezier functions, keep it simple, zeros and ones.                     |
| [07:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=446.72)  | And he has his new favorites are on an at key framers episode.                                       |
| [07:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=450.96)  | So go check out at key framers.                                                                      |
| [07:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=452.08)  | And he talks about how to make the perfect cubic Bezier with just zeros and ones.                    |
| [07:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=456.76)  | So anyway, I thought it was a really good tip.                                                       |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=458.48)  | Nice, nice.                                                                                          |
| [07:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=459.6)   | Next is the transition delay.                                                                        |
| [07:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=461.04)  | So when this effect has happened, how long should it wait until the transition starts                |
| [07:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=466.5)   | and accepts a time value and the default is zero.                                                    |
| [07:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=469.34)  | So things will start immediately.                                                                    |
| [07:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=471.92)  | And you can give this a negative value.                                                              |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=473.6)   | So this has a similar feature we've talked about in animations where you can sort of                 |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=478.88)  | debug an animation by setting the delay to like negative four seconds.                               |
| [08:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=482.78)  | And you could watch the last four seconds of an animation that way.                                  |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=486.06)  | And there's also other cool tricks to do with this, but yeah, you can specify an offset              |
| [08:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=490.0)   | that way.                                                                                            |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=491.0)   | Kind of nice.                                                                                        |
| [08:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=492.0)   | That's cool.                                                                                         |
| [08:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=493.0)   | Then all of this can be combined with the transition shorthand.                                      |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=496.58)  | So instead of writing these all out individually, you can just write transition colon and the        |
| [08:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=501.2)   | order of the arguments for transition property is transition property, transition duration,          |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=507.04)  | transition timing function, and then transition delay.                                               |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=510.24)  | So an example is like transition colon transform one second ease in.                                 |
| [08:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=515.92)  | And this is space separated because you're setting one value at a time.                              |
| [08:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=519.88)  | So this is one transition.                                                                           |
| [08:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=521.04)  | You're transitioning the transform function, the transform property, sorry, by one second            |
| [08:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=526.68)  | and you're doing an ease in timing function.                                                         |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=530.24)  | So you can also have multiple transitions at the same time that you define in the transition         |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=535.16)  | shorthand.                                                                                           |
| [08:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=536.16)  | And you'd have to use a comma to separate those values.                                              |
| [08:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=537.92)  | So you could do something like transition colon transform one second ease in comma color             |
| [09:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=545.04)  | 1.5 seconds.                                                                                         |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=546.32)  | So this here, you'd have an ease in one second transform transition and you would have a             |
| [09:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=552.08)  | 1.5 second color transition.                                                                         |
| [09:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=553.32)  | So your color would be continuing to transition after your transform has finished transitioning.     |
| [09:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=558.62)  | So you could just define a bunch and have like more specific differentiation for how                 |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=562.76)  | those things change.                                                                                 |
| [09:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=564.32)  | Oh, yeah.                                                                                            |
| [09:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=566.02)  | And I use that all the time.                                                                         |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=567.52)  | So I'll do transition colon transform, you know, I don't know, let's just say 0.5 seconds            |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=573.04)  | and I'll say comma opacity over like 0.3 seconds and I'll give it a delay.                           |
| [09:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=579.1)   | So I have this hover effect where something will slide in and the opacity effect comes               |
| [09:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=584.16)  | in a little later so that it looks like there's a faster slide.                                      |
| [09:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=587.84)  | Like it was already in motion before the crossfade began.                                            |
| [09:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=590.6)   | So just really cool things you can do just adding a comma and changing a couple of seconds           |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=595.74)  | on these values.                                                                                     |
| [09:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=597.14)  | It's really nice.                                                                                    |
| [09:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=598.14)  | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [09:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=599.14)  | And here's a, we're just going to go into things that can transition now.                            |
| [10:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=602.74)  | So this is like, tell us what we can, because we sort of only heard what we can't.                   |
| [10:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=607.2)   | And one of the tips here is that in each spec, what a property is defined, it has to include         |
| [10:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=612.84)  | whether or not it's animatable.                                                                      |
| [10:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=615.02)  | And it's called animation type.                                                                      |
| [10:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=617.08)  | And to save you from coming specs, we'll cover a few things where the animation type is animatable.  |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=623.58)  | One of them is outline offset.                                                                       |
| [10:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=625.48)  | So this is one that I don't think folks think about a lot, but when you focus on something,          |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=630.0)   | you can offset that outline so it's not so shrink wrapped on the element and you can                 |
| [10:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=634.96)  | animate that.                                                                                        |
| [10:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=635.96)  | So when something focuses on it, you can expand the outline offset.                                  |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=639.4)   | You could bounce it.                                                                                 |
| [10:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=640.4)   | You could do all sorts of really neat things.                                                        |
| [10:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=642.4)   | You could like recreate the switch home screen.                                                      |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=644.32)  | I don't know.                                                                                        |
| [10:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=645.32)  | So outline offset, you're animatable and that's cool.                                                |
| [10:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=648.08)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [10:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=649.08)  | And that actually reminds me of a pretty frequent one, which is animating borders in and out         |
| [10:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=652.96)  | or the like position of borders, like being tight with the text or further away or having            |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=659.28)  | them like kind of change color, like things like that.                                               |
| [11:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=662.64)  | Outline offset is definitely just another great example of how you could apply a wrapper             |
| [11:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=668.64)  | around an element, a visual wrapper and have it sort of animate with your interaction.               |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=672.48)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [11:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=673.48)  | Next we have transforms.                                                                             |
| [11:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=675.76)  | Transforms are great with transitions and animations because they apply GPU acceleration             |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=680.48)  | when you make adjustments and that reduces jank on your page.                                        |
| [11:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=683.52)  | And we did a whole episode of transforms on that is episode 41.                                      |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=689.24)  | All the cool things that you can do with them are covered in that episode in much more detail.       |
| [11:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=694.06)  | So definitely check out episode 41, all of that transforms.                                          |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=698.2)   | But essentially with transforms, you could do 2D or 3D transformations and adjust where              |
| [11:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=703.24)  | something is placed on the screen, or you can skew, stretch, scale, shrink, flip and                 |
| [11:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=710.16)  | do a bunch of other geometric transformations on an element.                                         |
| [11:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=714.86)  | So definitely check out our episode on transforms for more about those.                              |
| [12:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=720.0)   | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [12:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=721.0)   | And those transforms are interruptible, so you can sort of change them on the fly with               |
| [12:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=725.18)  | JavaScript and CSS just goes, oh, a new location.                                                    |
| [12:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=727.96)  | Okay, here, I'll go there over time.                                                                 |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=729.6)   | Oh, a new location.                                                                                  |
| [12:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=730.6)   | I'll go there over time.                                                                             |
| [12:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=731.8)   | Yeah, even when you're doing like a hover over transform, if it's like taking five seconds           |
| [12:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=735.56)  | and you hover for one second, it'll start and then it'll go back depending on your easing            |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=738.78)  | function and like how you've set up your transition.                                                 |
| [12:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=742.04)  | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [12:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=743.04)  | It is a superpower.                                                                                  |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=744.52)  | Let's just say it transitions are super cool superpower because you're just like, oh, I              |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=748.48)  | changed a value.                                                                                     |
| [12:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=749.48)  | Anyway, whatever.                                                                                    |
| [12:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=750.48)  | They're cool.                                                                                        |
| [12:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=751.48)  | Okay, so clip path, you can animate clip path as well.                                               |
| [12:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=752.86)  | So these are like geometric masks.                                                                   |
| [12:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=754.36)  | We have a whole episode on these as well, but you can animate them in and out.                       |
| [12:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=758.04)  | And these do require, though, that the same shape function be used.                                  |
| [12:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=760.72)  | So if you can't make like a circle, become a square.                                                 |
| [12:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=762.84)  | They have to basically have the same amount of points.                                               |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=765.24)  | So you can use a path data now and polygon, both of which, as long as they're the same               |
| [12:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=769.72)  | sort of amount of points at the end, you can do some really cool morphing effects.                   |
| [12:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=775.08)  | Also, I have a website called transition.style where I've pretty much pre-made a lot of really       |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=779.84)  | common transitions that you'll do with these shapes and you just click them and go and               |
| [13:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=783.8)   | the vanilla CSS put it somewhere fun.                                                                |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=786.12)  | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [13:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=787.12)  | It's super cool to see all the different ways that you could enter an item into a screen,            |
| [13:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=791.24)  | exit the screen, transition between them.                                                            |
| [13:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=793.12)  | Definitely check out transition.style for examples of animated and transitioned clip                 |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=797.4)   | path.                                                                                                |
| [13:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=798.4)   | Next, we have gap.                                                                                   |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=799.64)  | Maybe you'd want to increase or decrease the gap between some items when you hovered                 |
| [13:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=803.2)   | or focused over a parent element.                                                                    |
| [13:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=805.44)  | This is something that we can do now.                                                                |
| [13:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=806.66)  | We have gap in grid.                                                                                 |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=807.66)  | We have gap in flex box.                                                                             |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=809.9)   | So one example would be maybe if you had like a menu bar and you wanted to increase the              |
| [13:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=813.44)  | space between the menu items when you hover over one of them so that you're kind of like             |
| [13:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=817.92)  | isolating things.                                                                                    |
| [13:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=818.92)  | That's just another example of where you could use this interoperable property that you can          |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=824.44)  | transition.                                                                                          |
| [13:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=825.44)  | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [13:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=826.44)  | And I remember just a couple months ago learning that aspect ratio could be transitioned too         |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=831.16)  | so that when it goes from a square to 16 by 9.                                                       |
| [13:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=833.52)  | Yeah, that was really cool work to see that get done in Chromium.                                    |
| [13:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=836.84)  | The last thing we have here that's animatable is the word all.                                       |
| [14:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=839.6)   | So let's break down what all really means because it's almost everything.                            |
| [14:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=844.08)  | Ironically, it's all, it's like everything, it's all but yeah, it's not.                             |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=851.24)  | So it says it's defined as things that have an animation type, having an animation type              |
| [14:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=855.92)  | that's not discrete or not animatable, which is yay.                                                 |
| [14:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=860.04)  | It's something like a not not, like I'm not not hungry, but it's more like I'm hungry                |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=863.34)  | but anything but discrete or non-animatable food item modules.                                       |
| [14:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=868.28)  | Anyway, okay, so it's anything but these two.                                                        |
| [14:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=871.52)  | Let me break down what discrete is and not animatable and then you'll know what all means.           |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=876.36)  | Discrete are property values that can't be meaningfully combined.                                    |
| [14:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=880.06)  | So it's not really additive and it can't be interpolated.                                            |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=883.28)  | So it basically swaps.                                                                               |
| [14:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=885.32)  | And these are things like display block, display inline block, like they're just discrete and        |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=890.28)  | they're a name for a thing and they're not really a like a typed value that can be transitioned.     |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=895.28)  | So anyway, there's also not animatable and it will be listed this way.                               |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=900.24)  | And these are things excluded from animations or transitions because animating them would            |
| [15:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=904.36)  | create excessive complications or they're sort of discrete, you know, like transition                |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=909.28)  | duration.                                                                                            |
| [15:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=910.28)  | You shouldn't be able to transition the transition duration.                                         |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=913.04)  | It just doesn't, even though it has a type that seems like it could, it just doesn't                 |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=915.68)  | make sense.                                                                                          |
| [15:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=916.68)  | So it's not animatable.                                                                              |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=918.5)   | But for some of these things that were previously not animatable, like we've covered, app property   |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=923.32)  | can simplify a chunk of it, allowing you to discreetly, I guess discrete is the wrong                |
| [15:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=928.96)  | word here.                                                                                           |
| [15:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=929.96)  | Anyway, it's allowing you to precisely target one part of a larger sort of definition and            |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=935.72)  | transition on that.                                                                                  |
| [15:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=936.72)  | So anyway, that's what all means.                                                                    |
| [15:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=937.88)  | It's everything but discrete or non-animatable things, which is still a lot of stuff.                |
| [15:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=942.02)  | And that note on app property, it's important to remember that you're not actually able              |
| [15:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=946.16)  | to transition that property still.                                                                   |
| [15:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=948.46)  | You're transitioning a custom value within a function.                                               |
| [15:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=952.84)  | Totally.                                                                                             |
| [15:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=953.84)  | So it's a little bit of a different change.                                                          |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=956.44)  | You can't transition that gradient from one to another, even if you're using app property            |
| [16:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=961.12)  | for the color values.                                                                                |
| [16:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=962.32)  | You can transition a color value and not change the gradient itself.                                 |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=967.16)  | Good call.                                                                                           |
| [16:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=968.16)  | Good call.                                                                                           |
| [16:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=969.16)  | So you're doing that.                                                                                |
| [16:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=970.16)  | Like you would actually use for your transition the variable and then set that or for an animation,  |
| [16:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=975.6)   | the variable.                                                                                        |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=977.22)  | So anyway, back to things that you can't transition.                                                 |
| [16:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=980.24)  | One thing that you can't transition is anything that has a value of auto because it's getting        |
| [16:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=985.04)  | that value and it's just discrete.                                                                   |
| [16:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=987.76)  | It's not animatable.                                                                                 |
| [16:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=988.76)  | Right.                                                                                               |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=989.76)  | And then display none.                                                                               |
| [16:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=990.88)  | You can't like display none and block animate that.                                                  |
| [16:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=993.84)  | Also font family.                                                                                    |
| [16:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=994.84)  | When you're setting font properties are often loading different typefaces and files for              |
| [16:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=998.74)  | those typefaces.                                                                                     |
| [16:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=999.74)  | So font family is one example where you would be probably loading a new font family itself.          |
| [16:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1005.36) | There's nothing to transition to.                                                                    |
| [16:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1007.16) | You could transition axes within variable fonts and get some pretty cool effects, but                |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1012.08) | you can't transition the font family itself.                                                         |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1014.92) | Additionally, you can't transition font properties like font styles, like making something italic    |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1021.16) | is something that you cannot transition because that's usually an entirely different typeface.       |
| [17:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1026.24) | That again, when you're using a variable font might not necessarily be true because you              |
| [17:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1029.96) | can transition these axes on the typeface.                                                           |
| [17:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1032.88) | So if you have like a oblique axis, you could transition that, but you can't just go from            |
| [17:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1038.28) | like italic to non italic smoothly typically.                                                        |
| [17:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1041.36) | Right.                                                                                               |
| [17:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1042.36) | I know.                                                                                              |
| [17:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1043.36) | Like some of the things are like, well, you're like, it could, it's computers.                       |
| [17:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1045.88) | And you're like, oh yeah.                                                                            |
| [17:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1046.88) | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [17:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1047.88) | Just anyway.                                                                                         |
| [17:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1048.88) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [17:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1049.88) | You made it like, yeah, you made it succinct when you're like, it's a whole different                |
| [17:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1052.4)  | font family.                                                                                         |
| [17:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1053.4)  | Like it is.                                                                                          |
| [17:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1054.4)  | It's a total swap scenario.                                                                          |
| [17:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1055.4)  | Anyway.                                                                                              |
| [17:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1056.4)  | Okay.                                                                                                |
| [17:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1057.4)  | So then we have like gradient stops and gradient color hints.                                        |
| [17:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1058.72) | Like you can't animate those.                                                                        |
| [17:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1059.88) | Oh wait, you can transition them.                                                                    |
| [17:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1061.96) | You just got to use at property.                                                                     |
| [17:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1063.36) | So target the percentage, target the angle, target a type of that gradient, and then you             |
| [17:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1068.08) | can transition that.                                                                                 |
| [17:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1069.28) | Yeah, totally.                                                                                       |
| [17:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1070.28) | So like your syntax type would be percentage when you're adjusting the gradient stops and            |
| [17:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1074.78) | it works great.                                                                                      |
| [17:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1075.78) | Like it's a really nice effect to transition gradients.                                              |
| [17:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1078.84) | So you also can't transition like the transition timing functions, which is, you know, like          |
| [18:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1084.72) | you're easing curves and things like that.                                                           |
| [18:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1086.84) | You can't change the timing function of your transitions as you're transitioning them.               |
| [18:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1091.68) | But fun fact, you actually can change the transition timing function in a CSS animation              |
| [18:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1096.68) | between the key frames because you have more than two states and in between the multiple             |
| [18:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1100.32) | states you can adjust the transition timing function.                                                |
| [18:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1102.78) | You can't change the duration because again, for the duration, just like with transition             |
| [18:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1106.72) | and animation, you're setting it for the entire adjustment period, but you could change the          |
| [18:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1112.44) | easing curve or steps, things like that for animations.                                              |
| [18:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1114.92) | You can't do it for transitions because you only have two states, start and end.                     |
| [18:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1118.52) | So yeah, it's a little bit less options.                                                             |
| [18:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1121.48) | You get with the transitions.                                                                        |
| [18:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1122.48) | Nice.                                                                                                |
| [18:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1123.48) | It makes sense.                                                                                      |
| [18:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1124.48) | So I'm kind of like this next one, animation name, you know, like properties defining animation      |
| [18:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1128.08) | parameters.                                                                                          |
| [18:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1129.08) | They're not animatable since doing so.                                                               |
| [18:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1130.82) | This would be just be, you could do crazy things if you could transition the animation               |
| [18:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1134.48) | name.                                                                                                |
| [18:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1135.48) | So can't do that.                                                                                    |
| [18:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1136.48) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [18:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1137.48) | And like content, content doesn't interpolate.                                                       |
| [18:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1138.48) | So you can't transition the content.                                                                 |
| [19:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1141.08) | What else can't you transition?                                                                      |
| [19:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1142.58) | What have you?                                                                                       |
| [19:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1143.58) | So I want to ask the audience, what have you tried to transition that you couldn't and               |
| [19:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1147.6)  | then it surprised you and you're like, but I thought I could.                                        |
| [19:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1151.44) | Send us those.                                                                                       |
| [19:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1152.44) | Will you tweet us with the hashtag CSS podcast and tell us what did you try to transition?           |
| [19:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1155.96) | Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                                                                    |
| [19:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1158.2)  | Let us know what you tried to transition.                                                            |
| [19:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1159.48) | I know for me, like blend modes or something that I wish was transitionable or animatable,           |
| [19:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1164.98) | but they're not because they're just like an on and off state on how something blends.               |
| [19:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1169.32) | You can't really transition those.                                                                   |
| [19:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1170.52) | You could transition like opacity and have something with a blend mode get an appearance             |
| [19:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1176.04) | from like opacity zero to one.                                                                       |
| [19:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1177.46) | So it kind of feels more like a transition.                                                          |
| [19:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1180.0)  | But if you are transitioning things, like the best practice and with animations is to                |
| [19:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1184.46) | use opacity or transforms or other things that are GPU accelerated.                                  |
| [19:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1188.4)  | So there is a more limited list of things that are performance, but I think we also                  |
| [19:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1192.98) | talked about that in our transforms show or animations show for sure.                                |
| [19:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1197.2)  | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| [19:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1198.2)  | And I tried to, I think everyone tries to transition height auto at some point too,                  |
| [20:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1202.04) | where they want to go from like, and that one's really frustrating.                                  |
| [20:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1205.96) | I wonder if that will happen one day.                                                                |
| [20:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1207.84) | We'll see.                                                                                           |
| [20:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1208.84) | From zero to auto, so like an image appears in without having to set the height.                     |
| [20:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1213.56) | Yeah, like 100%.                                                                                     |
| [20:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1214.56) | I feel like with content like fit and all those properties, I feel like it's less of                 |
| [20:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1220.0)  | an issue because you could always have object fit cover or object fit contain and then set           |
| [20:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1225.2)  | the size and the object, AKA the image or SVG will fit the space.                                    |
| [20:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1229.46) | So I feel like this is less of an issue now.                                                         |
| [20:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1231.84) | I think it's like paragraphs though.                                                                 |
| [20:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1233.68) | They're like a responsive paragraph.                                                                 |
| [20:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1235.2)  | Could I animate its height up and down?                                                              |
| [20:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1238.28) | And usually what I would tell people is I think you want to mask, like, cause you don't              |
| [20:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1241.48) | want to squish the text, right?                                                                      |
| [20:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1243.0)  | Anyway, this is getting off topic.                                                                   |
| [20:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1244.2)  | Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.                                                                          |
| [20:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1245.62) | That's another important thing.                                                                      |
| [20:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1246.62) | Like when you do transform functions, sometimes you do like squish the text.                         |
| [20:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1251.24) | Like sometimes if you are like transforming it to get like a scale X or the height of                |
| [20:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1256.48) | like, you know, say 100% to zero, that is a way to kind of like do auto, but you kind                |
| [21:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1263.04) | of get that squeezed visual.                                                                         |
| [21:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1264.76) | So some people will animate the opacity out and then the transform.                                  |
| [21:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1269.08) | So you don't see that squeeze or they'll animate both at the same time, but have the                 |
| [21:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1273.08) | opacity kind of quicker.                                                                             |
| [21:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1274.84) | Yeah, the text will go crossfade right out and then they'll finish out with the shape                |
| [21:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1278.72) | and stuff.                                                                                           |
| [21:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1279.72) | One of my favorite transition effects is having like text kind of fly in from like the side          |
| [21:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1284.88) | and the opacity at the same time.                                                                    |
| [21:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1286.36) | So it'd be like kind of coming in from like the left to the right or so, and then it's               |
| [21:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1291.52) | also getting opacity, so just like in a row.                                                         |
| [21:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1296.08) | Oh, nice, with a nice stagger.                                                                       |
| [21:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1297.32) | Oh, yeah.                                                                                            |
| [21:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1298.32) | Stagger, that's the word.                                                                            |
| [21:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1299.44) | So typical triggers for these transitions, I think the most common one that I use and                |
| [21:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1303.72) | see is hover.                                                                                        |
| [21:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1305.44) | So hovering over an element with a pointer device, like a link or a button, things like              |
| [21:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1310.36) | that.                                                                                                |
| [21:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1311.36) | Yeah, focus is another great one.                                                                    |
| [21:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1313.28) | Tabbing through, you've got focus for inputs and all sorts of things.                                |
| [21:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1317.04) | That's a great one.                                                                                  |
| [21:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1318.04) | There's also focus within.                                                                           |
| [21:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1319.04) | So this is when you're focusing within a parent.                                                     |
| [22:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1321.6)  | For example, if you're navigating a menu and you're focusing on a child, you can keep styles         |
| [22:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1326.36) | on a parent so that the parent, like the whole menu will stay open because a child of it             |
| [22:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1330.84) | has focus and you're focusing within it.                                                             |
| [22:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1333.04) | So it's just another way to apply these styles.                                                      |
| [22:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1335.56) | Yep, there's active, you know, someone's pointer is actively down on something, you could transition |
| [22:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1340.52) | to a new state or target, colon target, something's in the URL bar there.                            |
| [22:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1344.96) | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| [22:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1345.96) | So if you're applying a class change from JavaScript, so if you're applying a new state              |
| [22:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1350.76) | or a class to an element that has a base transition information, then it will start to transition.   |
| [22:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1357.96) | So you would have to set the transition name, the property name and the duration on the              |
| [22:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1364.32) | element and then you can apply the new state as a new class.                                         |
| [22:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1368.36) | So like an opened or hidden, whatever you want to transition it to, you can just do                  |
| [22:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1374.2)  | that through scripting.                                                                              |
| [22:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1375.2)  | That's a good call.                                                                                  |
| [22:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1376.2)  | I don't know if we covered that really, that the transition property needs to be present             |
| [23:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1380.76) | as like a default property of the element that you want to transition somewhere.                     |
| [23:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1384.6)  | So like state A essentially has to have the transition duration and all that stuff so                |
| [23:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1389.48) | that state B can actually go somewhere.                                                              |
| [23:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1391.88) | Because that is an issue.                                                                            |
| [23:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1392.88) | Well, it also is into the next tip, which is you can change it once you're at state                  |
| [23:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1397.48) | B, like let's say you are hovering at the hover, you can set some new transition information         |
| [23:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1402.92) | that maybe is faster so you can change the enter and the exit by changing certain transition         |
| [23:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1409.04) | properties at state A or state B. So anyway, but you have to have state A defined first              |
| [23:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1413.92) | before you can go redefining it in state B to get different enters and exits.                        |
| [23:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1417.96) | Right, exactly.                                                                                      |
| [23:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1419.28) | So usually I'll have all the transition information set up and then just whatever the end state      |
| [23:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1425.24) | is for that thing, which could also be like the reverse if you were always applying like             |
| [23:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1430.04) | hidden, and you had that, I don't know, say opacity zero, and then you remove it to make             |
| [23:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1435.88) | something appear.                                                                                    |
| [23:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1436.88) | That's another technique.                                                                            |
| [23:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1437.88) | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| [23:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HyziUjpMt5HZ4mbVvBlDp?&t=1438.88) | Wow.                                                                                                 |
