| [00:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=18.28)   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                        |

| [00:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=20.28)   | I mean, no, yes, yes, no.                                                                        |

| [00:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=22.64)   | It's been three years.                                                                           |
| [00:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=23.64)   | Year three.                                                                                      |

| [00:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=25.64)   | Wow.                                                                                             |

| [00:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=29.96)   | and pieces of the platform for building frictionless and engaging web experiences.               |
| [00:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=36.44)   | That sounds pretty fancy, doesn't it?                                                            |
| [00:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=37.84)   | Yep.                                                                                             |

| [00:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=47.54)   | In this season of the CSS podcast, we wanted to keep you up to date with what's new in           |
| [00:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=52.6)    | 2022 because there is a lot happening in web UI.                                                 |
| [00:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=55.36)   | We've got some pretty powerful APIs landing across modern browsers and we couldn't be            |
| [00:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=59.44)   | more excited.                                                                                    |
| [01:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=60.44)   | But if you have to support older browsers, don't worry.                                          |
| [01:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=63.44)   | We'll be highlighting what browser support looks like today and if there are polyfills           |
| [01:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=67.52)   | or tools that you can use to bridge the gap in between.                                          |
| [01:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=71.2)    | And if you want more content about how to master CSS from basic text color to backgrounds        |
| [01:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=75.78)   | and beyond, check out our other seasons where we cover just that.                                |
| [01:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=80.24)   | And check out the course we put together on web.dev called Learn CSS, aptly named, I must        |
| [01:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=88.64)   | say.                                                                                             |
| [01:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=89.64)   | And that's a place where you can go to catch up on all things CSS.                               |
| [01:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=92.48)   | Speaking of Learn CSS though and CSS basics, the CSS cascade is one elemental concept that       |
| [01:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=99.08)   | everyone who writes styles runs into.                                                            |
| [01:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=101.72)  | And the fundamental capabilities of that cascade have actually changed quite recently with       |
| [01:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=106.48)  | cascade layers landing in all modern browsers.                                                   |
| [01:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=110.12)  | Oh, good call.                                                                                   |
| [01:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=112.04)  | Before we dive into at layer and how it's changed the way that we can inject points              |
| [01:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=116.6)   | into the cascade, let's review how it worked before cascade layers landed this year.             |
| [02:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=121.66)  | We also have an episode from season one on the cascade and a Learn CSS module as Adam            |
| [02:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=126.96)  | just talked about on exactly this.                                                               |
| [02:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=129.2)   | So definitely review that if you want more on the cascade.                                       |
| [02:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=132.52)  | So let's talk about order of appearance.                                                         |
| [02:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=134.72)  | Say you have a P tag in your styles with the color of hot pink and then further down in          |
| [02:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=140.0)   | the same CSS file or an imported file, you have a P color, Rebecca purple.                       |
| [02:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=145.92)  | Now all of your paragraphs will be Rebecca purple because that's the most recent in              |
| [02:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=150.64)  | the order of appearance.                                                                         |
| [02:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=152.56)  | If you want all of the paragraphs to be hot pink instead, you could increase the specificity     |
| [02:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=157.12)  | of the first paragraph style and then reflect that in the DOM, but that would be more work       |
| [02:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=160.44)  | and you don't always have control over the DOM.                                                  |
| [02:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=162.72)  | Or you can apply important tags to invert the cascade and make it win, but that would            |
| [02:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=167.32)  | be a hack.                                                                                       |
| [02:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=168.42)  | With cascade layers, you can give some more information to the browser about the two different   |
| [02:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=173.44)  | paragraph styles, like why there are two and when each should apply.                             |
| [02:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=177.56)  | Totally.                                                                                         |
| [02:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=178.56)  | And at layer comes in to give you control and tools to assist in the browser's resolution        |
| [03:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=182.76)  | of that paragraph style and more, which we'll cover.                                             |
| [03:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=188.84)  | So those two-                                                                                    |
| [03:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=189.84)  | We should whisper in our podcast.                                                                |
| [03:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=190.84)  | That would bring a lot more attention and be like, are they whispering to me in this             |
| [03:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=196.84)  | episode?                                                                                         |
| [03:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=197.84)  | All right.                                                                                       |
| [03:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=198.84)  | So right now those two paragraph selectors, they're just floating in the global space            |
| [03:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=202.04)  | to CSS, just hanging out margaritas out in the stars.                                            |
| [03:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=206.2)   | And the order of appearance has them battle it out for a winner though.                          |
| [03:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=209.92)  | And they were just friends, but now they're having a battle.                                     |
| [03:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=212.04)  | That's so sad.                                                                                   |
| [03:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=213.04)  | But okay, so we have at layer.                                                                   |
| [03:35](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=214.78)  | If you add a couple layers in, you can add those paragraph styles within a context and           |
| [03:40](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=220.04)  | help others and the browser understand the intent of the style.                                  |
| [03:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=224.16)  | It's all about that style orchestration, right?                                                  |
| [03:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=226.66)  | We had two paragraph styles.                                                                     |
| [03:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=228.8)   | Why were they both there?                                                                        |
| [03:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=229.8)   | Put them in a layer with a nice name.                                                            |
| [03:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=231.4)   | Now everyone knows why both of them are there.                                                   |
| [03:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=233.64)  | So I find layers are especially helpful with reducing selector complexity because we don't       |
| [03:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=237.76)  | have to do as much battling.                                                                     |
| [03:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=239.4)   | We can write more simpler selectors.                                                             |
| [04:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=242.2)   | It helps with theming.                                                                           |
| [04:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=243.52)  | It helps with framework and library overrides, resets, normalize, or baselines, which are        |
| [04:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=248.0)   | kind of like overrides too.                                                                      |
| [04:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=249.64)  | And then pseudo classes like focus visible, like OpenProps recently had a need to use            |
| [04:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=254.16)  | layers so that the custom focus style was easier to override.                                    |
| [04:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=257.96)  | Even though it was using where it still had some sticky specificity, but put it in a layer       |
| [04:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=262.4)   | and now it's much easier for authors to overcome.                                                |
| [04:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=264.96)  | So let's dig into creating layers.                                                               |
| [04:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=266.9)   | Now that we have a small overview of when and why to use them, you know, kick us off             |
| [04:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=270.52)  | with the basics of cascade layers.                                                               |
| [04:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=272.64)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [04:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=273.64)  | So the first thing that you need to know is that layers are defined at the time of their         |
| [04:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=276.64)  | first appearance.                                                                                |
| [04:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=278.04)  | So you can define a layer like at layer reset at the top of your CSS entry file.                 |
| [04:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=283.74)  | If there's nothing in it, you can just set the order and it'll appear when you do put            |
| [04:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=287.68)  | styles in it.                                                                                    |
| [04:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=288.68)  | So you could set up your layered order before you even write the styles.                         |
| [04:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=292.08)  | The order of appearance of layers is important as it defines layer resolution priority, which    |
| [04:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=296.64)  | is the whole reason that you're using layers.                                                    |
| [05:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=299.56)  | Things that are higher in the stack will win over things that are lower in the stack.            |
| [05:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=303.54)  | So things that come later in that set in that line will win.                                     |
| [05:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=307.98)  | It is a best practice to define your layer order in one place and ahead of time.                 |
| [05:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=312.8)   | Like you could write at layer reset base libraries and then my app.                              |
| [05:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=318.0)   | This is typically done in an index.css or whatever your first entry file into CSS is.            |
| [05:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=324.24)  | Maybe it's main so that the stack is clear and upfront for the rest of the styles to             |
| [05:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=328.0)   | be placed within.                                                                                |
| [05:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=329.78)  | Layers created first are lower in the stack, giving them less precedence when compared           |
| [05:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=333.76)  | to styles higher in the stack and order of appearance still matters.                             |
| [05:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=337.84)  | Now you can assign styles to someone that's already in the stack that you created.               |
| [05:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=343.48)  | So no matter where you have it later in your CSS file, you can put that into a layer later.      |
| [05:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=348.44)  | You've already set up the layer order and the precedence of those styles.                        |
| [05:53](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=353.08)  | Yep.                                                                                             |
| [05:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=354.08)  | Good call.                                                                                       |
| [05:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=355.08)  | Yeah, you predefined that stack and then things can just load whenever and you can put them      |
| [05:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=358.96)  | into a stack and have that full control upfront.                                                 |
| [06:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=362.28)  | Super nice.                                                                                      |
| [06:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=363.6)   | So that was defining layers ahead of time.                                                       |
| [06:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=365.76)  | You can also define layers just in time.                                                         |
| [06:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=368.08)  | You can define one layer and put some stuff in it at the same time.                              |
| [06:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=371.32)  | Like as if you're saying create this layer if it doesn't exist yet and add these styles          |
| [06:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=374.46)  | to it.                                                                                           |
| [06:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=375.46)  | This could be something along the lines of at layer space reset, open up a curly bracket,        |
| [06:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=379.92)  | put a star selector and open in curly bracket and say margin zero box sizing border box          |
| [06:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=384.72)  | and end your curlies.                                                                            |
| [06:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=386.16)  | And now you have created a layer named reset.                                                    |
| [06:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=388.54)  | You've added a style inside of it all at the same time.                                          |
| [06:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=392.4)   | And what's kind of cool is even though it got defined with styles inside of it, you              |
| [06:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=396.16)  | can add styles to it later.                                                                      |
| [06:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=397.64)  | Just reference the at layer space reset block and add some more stuff.                           |
| [06:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=401.82)  | So hopefully you're starting to get what this is doing.                                          |
| [06:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=403.8)   | It's taking out the meticulous management of which import comes before which import              |
| [06:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=407.76)  | or which style comes before which style.                                                         |
| [06:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=410.46)  | It lets you define some layers and as new styles are found, they can easily be placed            |
| [06:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=414.42)  | further down or up in the stack that you predefined, letting you control the order of appearance |
| [07:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=419.76)  | for the browser renderer.                                                                        |
| [07:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=421.48)  | You can also import entire style sheets into a layer or append more styles later to a layer.     |
| [07:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=427.8)   | So a really great way to use at layer would be to import entire libraries.                       |
| [07:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=432.36)  | You could put at import URL, bootstrap.css and then as you import it, you could specify          |
| [07:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=438.72)  | a layer for the import.                                                                          |
| [07:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=440.22)  | So you can write, you know, space separated layer and then in parentheses libraries.             |
| [07:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=446.22)  | So altogether in one place, we've just created an import that we also put into a layer.          |
| [07:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=452.9)   | Libraries or styles don't need to be authored locally.                                           |
| [07:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=455.54)  | You can also write them this way.                                                                |
| [07:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=457.86)  | It's generally a good idea to define all of your layers upfront still.                           |
| [07:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=461.58)  | So establishing the override order early so it's clear.                                          |
| [07:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=465.42)  | And speaking of which, if a layer has already been created and it finds another set of styles    |
| [07:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=470.1)   | that want to go into a layer by the same name, it appends them.                                  |
| [07:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=474.3)   | So you can add to a layer that you already specified earlier in the layer order much             |
| [07:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=479.22)  | later in your CSS files, which is one of its superpowers, one of the really cool things          |
| [08:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=483.78)  | about cascade layers.                                                                            |
| [08:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=485.62)  | Styles loaded much later than previous styles can just be inserted into that layer order         |
| [08:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=490.94)  | and then they can be applied as though they were loaded initially right at the beginning.        |
| [08:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=495.14)  | So pretty cool.                                                                                  |
| [08:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=496.88)  | It's worth noting here too that even with the post CSS at layer and CSS import concat            |
| [08:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=502.82)  | tools, they're already up to date and will handle bundling these styles for you in a             |
| [08:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=507.02)  | performant way.                                                                                  |
| [08:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=508.02)  | Yep.                                                                                             |
| [08:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=509.02)  | Very cool tip there.                                                                             |
| [08:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=510.2)   | There's also anonymous layers.                                                                   |
| [08:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=512.46)  | Ooh, that sounds fun.                                                                            |

| [08:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=517.22)  | We don't know.                                                                                   |
| [08:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=518.22)  | They're anonymous.                                                                               |
| [08:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=519.22)  | And these work the same as named layers except they're not named.                                |
| [08:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=522.62)  | Well, that's a lame way to describe them.                                                        |
| [08:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=524.42)  | No, they work the same way as layers except that nothing can be assigned to the layer            |
| [08:48](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=527.82)  | later, right?                                                                                    |
| [08:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=528.82)  | It doesn't have a name.                                                                          |
| [08:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=529.82)  | So these are layered in the order received.                                                      |
| [08:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=532.4)   | More precedence than styles, not in any layer.                                                   |
| [08:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=535.26)  | It's as if you can demote and lock in some styles with the strategy, weaving them into           |
| [08:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=539.12)  | your layers in an anonymous way.                                                                 |
| [09:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=541.22)  | There's also nested layers.                                                                      |
| [09:03](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=542.56)  | So you can think of nested layers like nested namespaces.                                        |
| [09:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=546.3)   | And these can come in super handy when your layer names start to get verbose and repetitive      |
| [09:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=550.22)  | like base reset, base normalized, base tokens.                                                   |
| [09:15](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=554.54)  | So instead you can write these as base.reset, base.normalized, base.tokens, and they all         |
| [09:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=559.5)   | live inside the base layer as named sub layers.                                                  |
| [09:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=562.7)   | So this gives it a nice added layer of organization.                                             |
| [09:27](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=566.62)  | It's all about that base.                                                                        |
| [09:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=568.0)   | Like you said base many times.                                                                   |
| [09:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=569.0)   | I'm like, this should be the cascade layer song.                                                 |
| [09:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=570.74)  | It's all about that base.                                                                        |
| [09:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=571.74)  | It's all about that base.                                                                        |
| [09:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=573.02)  | Styles can be added to nested layers at any time, just like normal layers.                       |
| [09:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=576.38)  | So what about styles not in a layer?                                                             |
| [09:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=580.7)   | What do they do?                                                                                 |
| [09:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=581.7)   | Well, it turns out what happens to styles that aren't in a layer?                                |
| [09:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=584.78)  | Here's the question, I guess.                                                                    |
| [09:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=585.78)  | Are they more or less important than styles in a layer?                                          |
| [09:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=589.34)  | Well it turns out they're more important, which is kind of an interesting feature.               |
| [09:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=592.5)   | You would have maybe expected the reverse, but they decided that when they were building         |
| [09:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=596.46)  | this that it's meaningful to have the existing styles of your application be more important      |
| [10:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=601.34)  | than these future kind of 2022 and beyond styles.                                                |
| [10:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=605.06)  | And so anything that's not in a layer has more importance than things in a layer.                |
| [10:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=609.44)  | So while creating layers allows managing style importance with orchestrated style folding,       |
| [10:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=614.2)   | it turns out that those styles are only competing against other layers really.                   |
| [10:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=618.46)  | And unlayered styles can show up and take precedence nice and easy.                              |
| [10:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=621.58)  | Yeah, that's a really important point.                                                           |
| [10:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=623.66)  | If you are working with layers, just be aware that your styles outside of the layer will         |
| [10:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=629.9)   | override any styles you put in the layer.                                                        |
| [10:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=632.48)  | So as I mentioned, great for libraries, great for base styles, overriding, but don't expect      |
| [10:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=639.42)  | any styles you put in a layer to appear on top of your existing styles if that's what            |
| [10:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=643.62)  | you were thinking as a mental understanding of layers.                                           |
| [10:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=647.34)  | So styles not in a layer have higher priority than unlayered styles, but how are the rest        |
| [10:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=652.34)  | of the layer priorities established?                                                             |
| [10:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=654.66)  | This comes back to our original conversation about order of appearance.                          |
| [10:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=658.7)   | So layers that appear first will have a lower priority than layers that come later.              |
| [11:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=663.62)  | So you can think of them like things that come first, show up at the bottom of a stack           |
| [11:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=668.02)  | and anything comes in, they're all piling on top of and the thing on top is going to             |
| [11:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=671.3)   | be the one most recent.                                                                          |
| [11:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=672.36)  | So I like to think it's helpful here thinking about it CSS or IT CSS by Harry Roberts, aka       |
| [11:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=677.3)   | the inverted triangle CSS.                                                                       |
| [11:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=679.74)  | At the lowest priority in IT CSS is settings.                                                    |
| [11:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=683.42)  | This becomes a place for defaults.                                                               |
| [11:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=684.98)  | So in case no additional styles are found in any of the other layers, they can use the           |
| [11:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=688.8)   | things in this lowest layer from settings.                                                       |
| [11:31](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=691.24)  | The next priority is tools, then generic, then elements, then objects, then components,          |
| [11:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=696.54)  | and then utilities.                                                                              |
| [11:38](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=697.78)  | Each layer that comes next has a higher priority of styles than the one before it.               |
| [11:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=701.66)  | If the layer shows up later, it's got higher priority.                                           |
| [11:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=705.0)   | You can strategically leverage this so that the layer at the bottom of your styles or            |
| [11:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=708.82)  | the last layer loaded is, well, just like normal, the highest priority set of styles.            |
| [11:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=713.7)   | You can also strategically establish the inverted triangle layers with the CSS just like this.   |
| [11:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=719.26)  | At layer space settings, comma, tools, comma, generic, comma, elements, comma, objects,          |
| [12:04](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=724.42)  | comma, components, comma, chameleon, comma, utilities.                                           |
| [12:10](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=729.82)  | So that's as easy as you can establish the entire inverted triangle with one line of             |
| [12:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=734.06)  | CSS, and then all of your styles subsequently just specify which layer they want to be in,       |
| [12:19](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=738.66)  | and you get to decide that as the author.                                                        |
| [12:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=740.86)  | So this layer priority comes into clear effect when a style is in a low priority layer but       |
| [12:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=744.96)  | has a high specificity selector.                                                                 |
| [12:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=747.56)  | So your normal intuition would be that the high specificity selector is going to win.            |
| [12:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=751.88)  | But since it's in a layer, its specificity is scoped to the bounds of that layer, and            |
| [12:37](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=756.58)  | a higher priority layer can provide a winning selector and style without battling that high      |
| [12:42](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=762.38)  | specificity selector.                                                                            |
| [12:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=765.02)  | I think this is the funniest thing about layers when you're starting to play with them.          |
| [12:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=768.7)   | You have to remember that layers always win.                                                     |
| [12:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=771.8)   | It's a whole new entry point in the cascade.                                                     |
| [12:54](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=774.38)  | It's a really good point, yeah.                                                                  |
| [12:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=776.5)   | So let's not forget about important and how that works with layers.                              |
| [13:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=780.22)  | Right off the bat, it's good to know that while unlayered styles win over layered styles,        |
| [13:06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=785.66)  | if a style in a layer has an important tag on it, like the bang important, it wins.              |
| [13:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=791.62)  | And this is because important actually inverts layer order for that style.                       |
| [13:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=796.66)  | So the lowest precedent styles become the highest precedent.                                     |
| [13:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=800.3)   | And this is across all the cascades.                                                             |
| [13:22](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=802.1)   | So for example, the lowest precedent styles are user agent style, styles that the user           |
| [13:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=808.16)  | agent or your browser provides.                                                                  |
| [13:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=809.54)  | And if any of these styles have an important applied to them, they invert to be the highest      |
| [13:34](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=813.5)   | specificity, the highest importance.                                                             |
| [13:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=816.36)  | So it works like this across all of the cascade.                                                 |
| [13:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=820.58)  | I never even knew this until cascade layers came into play.                                      |
| [13:44](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=823.74)  | And then, oh, that's how CSS works.                                                              |
| [13:47](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=827.36)  | So yeah, layered styles are similar.                                                             |
| [13:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=830.54)  | If there's more than one important style across multiple layers, then you compare their order    |
| [13:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=834.9)   | of appearance and specificity with lower level layers going to be inverted and then having       |
| [14:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=840.66)  | more specificity than higher level layers.                                                       |
| [14:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=845.06)  | So for a really great deep dive on this, there's a talk by our coworker Brahmas who did a deep   |
| [14:11](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=851.26)  | dive into layers.                                                                                |
| [14:12](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=852.26)  | And there's some really nice visuals that go into why this works and how this works.             |
| [14:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=857.18)  | And we'll put a link to that in the show notes.                                                  |
| [14:21](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=860.58)  | Is and where can also help with specificity.                                                     |
| [14:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=863.06)  | We have an episode on this as well.                                                              |
| [14:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=864.9)   | It's episode 47, which you can review for more on those selectors.                               |
| [14:29](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=869.1)   | But the TLDR is that they can wipe out the specificity of a selector.                            |
| [14:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=872.94)  | Like when using where, you can group selectors.                                                  |
| [14:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=876.22)  | And with is, it takes the higher of the specificity of any of the selectors.                     |
| [14:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=880.7)   | So episode 47 really does break that down.                                                       |
| [14:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=882.82)  | I highly recommend giving it a listen if you haven't yet.                                        |
| [14:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=886.06)  | But yeah, there's so many ways to specify styles.                                                |
| [14:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=889.9)   | There's only more ways.                                                                          |
| [14:51](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=890.9)   | It is so funny when we're talking about important and how it flips it.                           |
| [14:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=894.54)  | I, for some reason, just kept thinking of Missy Elliott and flip it and reverse it.              |
| [14:59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=898.9)   | So maybe important.                                                                              |
| [15:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=899.9)   | Take your style down, flip it and reverse it.                                                    |
| [15:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=902.38)  | So anytime I see important, I'm just like, hey, Missy, I see you.                                |
| [15:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=907.06)  | I see you, Missy.                                                                                |
| [15:08](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=908.06)  | All right.                                                                                       |
| [15:09](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=909.06)  | So that is a pretty good breakdown of layers, ways to use them, gotchas, things that are         |
| [15:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=913.46)  | interesting.                                                                                     |
| [15:14](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=914.46)  | Let's talk about DevTools.                                                                       |
| [15:16](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=915.58)  | So the DevTools are here to help you manage your layers.                                         |
| [15:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=917.86)  | You know it because you and I helped.                                                            |
| [15:20](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=919.52)  | So we're going to make sure that this doesn't deploy without a subsequent DevTool to help        |
| [15:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=923.34)  | you debug it.                                                                                    |
| [15:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=924.34)  | And the DevTools are very cool.                                                                  |
| [15:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=925.46)  | So you'll find them in the styles pane.                                                          |
| [15:28](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=927.78)  | They'll show which layer the styles came from and will already be ordered how the browser        |
| [15:32](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=932.36)  | is using them.                                                                                   |
| [15:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=933.36)  | So it's kind of a very familiar feel in that sidebar.                                            |
| [15:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=936.34)  | And this can take the guesswork out of using layers.                                             |
| [15:39](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=939.0)   | This also can be great for teaching and for debugging.                                           |
| [15:43](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=942.66)  | So don't miss the help you get from there.                                                       |
| [15:45](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=944.9)   | For example, you can easily section out supporting demo styles into a layer called support and   |
| [15:50](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=950.38)  | put your important demo styles in a demo layer called, well, demo, making it clear to read,      |
| [15:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=956.18)  | easy to understand the purpose of each block of styles and clearly show which styles are         |
| [16:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=960.38)  | more important than others based on the layer and the order of appearance.                       |
| [16:05](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=964.9)   | Also important to note, browser support.                                                         |
| [16:07](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=967.06)  | So at layer landed across all modern browsers earlier this year, and it is supported in          |
| [16:13](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=972.54)  | Firefox 97, Safari 15.4, and Chromium 99.                                                        |
| [16:17](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=977.14)  | That's Chrome and Edge.                                                                          |
| [16:18](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=978.3)   | If a browser reads a style sheet that has layers in it, it will ignore everything inside         |
| [16:23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=982.96)  | the layer.                                                                                       |
| [16:24](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=984.14)  | So keep that in mind.                                                                            |
| [16:26](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=985.92)  | This can be a way for you to progressively enhance your styles with layers, adding only          |
| [16:30](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=989.8)   | new things but keeping the base functionality.                                                   |
| [16:33](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=992.62)  | Or if you don't realize this, it could completely break your styles if you are expecting the     |
| [16:36](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=996.42)  | code within the layer to work and if it's critical to your styles.                               |
| [16:41](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1000.64) | So just be aware that the browser will ignore the entire declaration of the layer if it's        |
| [16:46](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1006.38) | in a non-supported browser.                                                                      |
| [16:49](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1008.82) | Classic CSS, it's going to read it and go, hmm, no idea what you are.                            |
| [16:52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1011.94) | I'm going to silently throw it away and move on.                                                 |
| [16:55](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1014.7)  | Yeah.                                                                                            |
| [16:56](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1015.7)  | Thank you.                                                                                       |
| [16:57](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1016.7)  | That was something we had to test.                                                               |
| [16:58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1017.7)  | Like, it's just going to ignore the out layer line or the whole declaration block.               |
| [17:01](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1021.34) | It's the declaration block.                                                                      |
| [17:02](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VOAXo6EZ7THJxm81gVDJZ?&t=1022.34) | Nice.                                                                                            |
